In 2025 SWIG still has no alternatives. It is surely dated and it may be 
time to think about a successor project, but currently I am not aware of 
anyone actually working on it.

Recently there has been a new way to do it, pioneered by Boost and made 
very popular by the pybind11 project. This same approach has been copied 
by embind in emscripten/WASM and I also have my own nobind17 for 
Node.js. Even if these are much faster to learn and easier to maintain - 
because they do not require a special and very awkward specific language 
- everything is only C++ - they lack many of the advanced features that 
allow a very large library such as GDAL to have a fully native feel? - 
especially one that has not been designed from scratch to be used from a 
higher-level language.

Surely the 100% handwritten bindings - such as PDAL for C# or GDAL for 
Node.js or Julia - have their advantages, but the development cost is 
orders of magnitude higher. If I was to start GDAL for Node.js from 
scratch, I was surely going to use SWIG. Both GDAL for Node.js and GDAL 
for Julia use handwritten code because at the time of their creation, 
SWIG did not have good support for those languages. PDAL's API is orders 
of magnitude smaller than GDAL and it has been designed to be used from 
a higher-level language.

I personally think that the future belongs to a project that will use 
the LLVM front-end and produce pybind11-like code, but this project does 
not exist. NativeScript is going in this direction for JavaScript, but 
they too, they lack many of the advanced SWIG features.

Now, of course, if there is no one to work on GDAL for C#, there is 
nothing to be done. It is unlikely there will ever be onboarding for 
this, as its cost is far too great for something that probably will be 
used only once. I am afraid that there are no real alternatives besides 
SWIG.

  *   Surely the 100% handwritten bindings - such as PDAL for C# or GDAL for Node.js or Julia

Hi,

Just a small clarification, the Julia bindings are a 100% automatic creation and cost very little, when one knows how to do it.

clang.jl is a very feature-light pybind11-style wrapper generator. It 
does not support C++, objects, inheritance, overloading, type 
downcasting and upcasting, iterators, n:m argument mapping, exceptions 
and many other advanced features. It even lacks interaction with the 
garbage collector relying on the user manually freeing the returned C 
data structures. All these features would require extensive manual 
wrapping work to implement. This is the major strength of SWIG - because 
you can implement those advanced features with minimal amount of work if 
you are willing to accept its very steep learning curve.

I don't use Julia, but I can still see that GDAL.jl is far below the 
level of the Python bindings which I know quite well. There is a higher 
level API built on top of it - ArchGDAL.jl - but it seems to be 
completely handwritten.

Hello

I am interested in knowing if the ECW tests under in source file indicated below are run by automated workflow in GDAL Master branch?

https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/autotest/gdrivers/<https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/autotest/gdrivers/ecw.py>ecw.py<https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/autotest/gdrivers/ecw.py>

I was specifically looking to see if `test_ecw_7` is being ever run and was the run successful?

Please let me know.

As you can see in
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/actions/runs/13092743556/job/36531334316#step:18:14520

"gdrivers/ecw.py::test_ecw_7 SKIPPED (Driver ECW not present)"

So I don't think it is tested. Maybe in a different workflow, but I would
be surprised.

Hi Parveen,

test_ecw_7 is run (successfully) in the Ubuntu 20.04 configuration:
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/actions/runs/13092743556/job/36531334565#step:18:4258

I'm pretty sure this is the only workflow that has ECW available. Some ECW
tests are still skipped because they require a newer version of the ECW SDK
than is available in the test container.

Parveen,

your remark exactly intersects my ask for SDKs that could be downloaded 
from our CI. Tests are currently limited to libecw 3.3 which was the 
last one under a kind-of open license.

Yes, clang.jl only supports C but you make it sound as if it was a very limited product. But it?s not. Right, wrapped libraries need different amounts of handwritten code, and care must be taken on managing the memory owners and when it can be freed without crashing. ArchGDAL has a lot of code that was made in response to interaction with other Julia packages and to make upper level functions.

I don?t use Python, but from what I?ve seen all Python bindings examples can be reproduced in Julia. And more, in the Julia GMT wrapper (GMT.jl) I picked some parts of ArchGDAL and extended to wrap the most used GDAL CLI programs (gdaltranslate, gdalwarp, ogr2ogr, etc?)

Online (and the only so far ?) help for gdalwap

help?> gdalwarp

  gdalwarp(indata, options=String[]; dest="/vsimem/tmp", kwargs...)

  Image/Grid reprojection and warping function.

  Args
  ????

    ?  indata: Input data. It can be a file name, a GMTgrid or GMTimage object or a GDAL dataset

    ?  options: List of options. The accepted options are the ones of the gdal_translate utility. This list can be in the form of a vector
       of strings, or joined in a single string. The accepted options are the ones of the gdalwarp utility.

    ?  kwargs: Besides what was mentioned above one can also use meta=metadata, where metadata is a string vector with the form "NAME=...."
       for each of its elements. This data will be recognized by GDAL as Metadata. The kwargs may also contain the GMT region (-R), proj
       (-J), inc (-I) and save=fname options.

  Returns
  ???????

  A GMT grid or Image, or a GDAL dataset (or nothing if file was writen on disk).

clang.jl is a very feature-light pybind11-style wrapper generator. It does not support C++, objects, inheritance, overloading, type downcasting and upcasting, iterators, n:m argument mapping, exceptions and many other advanced features. It even lacks interaction with the garbage collector relying on the user manually freeing the returned C data structures. All these features would require extensive manual wrapping work to implement. This is the major strength of SWIG - because you can implement those advanced features with minimal amount of work if you are willing to accept its very steep learning curve.

I don't use Julia, but I can still see that GDAL.jl is far below the level of the Python bindings which I know quite well. There is a higher level API built on top of it - ArchGDAL.jl - but it seems to be completely handwritten.

Hi,

Just a small clarification, the Julia bindings are a 100% automatic creation and cost very little, when one knows how to do it.

My experience with GDAL informed what we did with PDAL. The first thing was to not use SWIG. Lessons were learned, as they say :) The approach of a single unified language binding generator was in fashion in the 1990s at the same time as using UML to automatically write software. History has shown both of these things to have frustrating consequences.



In 2025 SWIG still has no alternatives. It is surely dated and it may be time to think about a successor project, but currently I am not aware of anyone actually working on it.

Recently there has been a new way to do it, pioneered by Boost and made very popular by the pybind11 project. This same approach has been copied by embind in emscripten/WASM and I also have my own nobind17 for Node.js. Even if these are much faster to learn and easier to maintain - because they do not require a special and very awkward specific language - everything is only C++ - they lack many of the advanced features that allow a very large library such as GDAL to have a fully native feel  - especially one that has not been designed from scratch to be used from a higher-level language.

Surely the 100% handwritten bindings - such as PDAL for C# or GDAL for Node.js or Julia - have their advantages, but the development cost is orders of magnitude higher. If I was to start GDAL for Node.js from scratch, I was surely going to use SWIG. Both GDAL for Node.js and GDAL for Julia use handwritten code because at the time of their creation, SWIG did not have good support for those languages. PDAL's API is orders of magnitude smaller than GDAL and it has been designed to be used from a higher-level language.

I personally think that the future belongs to a project that will use the LLVM front-end and produce pybind11-like code, but this project does not exist. NativeScript is going in this direction for JavaScript, but they too, they lack many of the advanced SWIG features.

Now, of course, if there is no one to work on GDAL for C#, there is nothing to be done. It is unlikely there will ever be onboarding for this, as its cost is far too great for something that probably will be used only once. I am afraid that there are no real alternatives besides SWIG.

I can see that there's no calls to for the Zarr driver
'SetMetadataItem(GDAL_DMD_EXTENSION' or
'SetMetadataItem(GDAL_DMD_EXTENSIONS', but I wanted to ask about the
behaviour.

This makes sense to me:

gdal_translate gdrivers/data/netcdf/srid.nc out.zarr  -co COMPRESS=ZSTD
Output driver not found.

But in this case, nothing happens and  all is silent.  (I will PR to set
extension metadata but wondered if this is a problem).

gdalmdimtranslate gdrivers/data/netcdf/srid.nc out.zarr  -co
ARRAY:COMPRESS=ZSTD

Cheers, Mike

Hi Michael,

A PR to add .zarr as an extension for the Zarr driver ? Is it 
recommended by the Zarr spec (can't find anything) or considered a best 
practice ? This wasn't my impression, although that would certainly be 
desirable.

Fix or ticket about that welcome

Their quickstart <https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html> uses .zarr as the extension and the v3 spec <https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v3/core/v3.0.html> says:

> When storing a Zarr hierarchy in a filesystem-like store (e.g. the local filesystem or S3) as a sub-directory, it is recommended that the sub-directory name ends with `.zarr` to indicate the start of a hierarchy to users.

Subject: [gdal-dev] Issue (and suggested fix) compiling pdfium for GDAL
Message-ID: <382f249762b04091b33359a387c181c4@CD1-4BDAG06-P04.cdmail.common.airbusds.corp>

Hello,
I recently had to compile gdal 3.8 with pdfium support on an AlmaLinux 8 platform and I struggled for a while with an unexpected issue that I could finally come up with.
I used the latest version of the build_linux.sh procedure provided by Even Rouault (https://github.com/rouault/pdfium_build_gdal_3_8/blob/master/build_linux.sh).

I explain below the issue and the fix.

The issue I faced:
- the build_linux.sh script clones depot_tools.git and then checkouts a specific commit (1c4052d88ac510a3db4351e52c088cac524c726c in the case of gdal 3.8). The depot_tools repo is thus now in detached head on the 1c4052d8 commit. 
- Up to now, everything is completely fine and the underlying intent of this checkout (freezing the content of depot_tool) became clear to me when I compared the 1c4052d8 commit date (2023/08/16) and the date of the current build_linux.sh script (commited the following day)
- But then, the build_linux.sh script launches the two following commands : 'gclient config --unmanaged "$PDFIUM_URL"' and 'gclient sync --revision="$REV"' 
- ... and these commands end with the following error: "depot_tools/update_depot_tools: line 149: goma_ctl: command not found"

After analysis, the issue comes from the fact that these gclient commands perform a change in the state of the depot_tools repo:
- before launching the gclient commands, this repo was, as said above, in detached head on the 1c4052d8 commit. In this state, the goma_ctl script exists in the depot_tools.
- after launching the gclient commands, the depo_tools repo is detached head, but at origin/main. And the goma_ctl script does not exist anymore.
- Looking to the commit history, it appears that goma_ctl was removed on 2024/04/15 (commit "remove goma CIPD package").

The fix:
I tried to find a way to avoid depot_tools to be automatically updated and I finally found that setting the following variable before launching the build_linux.sh script did the trick:
DEPOT_TOOLS_UPDATE=0

Maybe this fix could be included in the several existing compilation procedures ?
(I only used the one related to gdal 3.8 but I think that the same issue - and the same fix - might be applicable for the other versions).

Best regards,

Patrick Floissac

Subject: [gdal-dev] Suggestion for generalization tools
Message-ID: <VI1PR09MB43195348FC649C6FEB17E6FFE9F42@VI1PR09MB4319.eurprd09.prod.outlook.com>

Hello GDAL Dev team,

As far as I know gdal_sieve is the only GDAL raster generalization tool and one of the few open source ones in general.

I would suggest to create a tool (or a few of them) that could use generalization alghoritms like expansion (dilation), shrinking (erosion), boundary smoothing, majority filtering, group segmentation and similar for classified raster images.

I have been using GDAL and developing GIS tools for a few years, and have been a GIS user for a few more, but I am not familiar with what the procedure is for building/suggesting new functionalities to the GDAL project.

Kind regards,

Mihovil

Hi GDAL devs,
does anyone know why GDAL_OF_ALL and GDAL_READONLY consts have the same
value?
Both are used by GDALOpenEx as nOpenFlags param so shouldn't they be
distinguishable?

*#define GDAL_OF_READONLY 0x00*
*#define GDAL_OF_ALL 0x00*

I would say that 0 is the default. Read only and all drivers.
If you want anything else, then specify it.

Subject: [gdal-dev] a possible memory leak in ogr\ogrsf_frmts\sqlite
Message-ID: <CAPULynWOkegvWCWVh=cJmRt-87QH_O9mMTraPjVZ5j-hE_P7VA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I was chasing for a long time a small 8 byte memory leak and was able
to identify it in the OGR sqlite extension binding, here's what I
observed:

A call to OGRSQLiteBaseDataSource::OpenOrCreateDB() would invoke
OGR2SQLITE_Register() and then sqlite3_auto_extension(). The latter is
a sqlite3 call that would malloc an 8 byte buffer for the extension
function entry point if the extension is unknown to sqlite3 (was not
previously registered).

This allocation seems to be unmanaged neither by sqlite3 nor by OGR
later causing an 8 byte memory leak.  I was able to resolve this by
adding a OGR2SQLITE_UnRegister() stub in ogrsqlitevirtualogr.cpp that
would call in a succession:

>
sqlite3_cancel_auto_extension ((void (*)(void)) OGR2SQLITE_static_register);
sqlite3_reset_auto_extension ();
<

and then have the OGR2SQLITE_UnRegister() stub called in
ogrsqlitedatasource.cpp \ OGRSQLiteBaseDataSource::CloseDB() right
after closing the database:

>
        sqlite3_close( hDB );
        hDB = nullptr;
        OGR2SQLITE_UnRegister();
<

This way the memory leak was gone. My app runs on VS2015/2019 with an
older GDAL release (2.4.4.) so the fix will be a bit different in 3.10
as the HAVE_SQLITE3EXT_H conditionals were not present in 2.4.4..

Best regards,
Deyan

this sounds more like "still reachable" memory in Valgrind terminology 
(https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/faq.html#faq.deflost), that is memory 
that is allocated by some component, still reachable by it but never 
explicitly freed before the end of the process, and the amount of it 
doesn't grow over time. There are certainly many similar such patterns 
in GDAL or other libraries it uses, and I don't see that as a bug or 
something that requires code changes.

Hello,

it may be needed for sure for the whole session or at least if you
need the already registered extension to be available at the next db
open attempt.

A deeper look in sqlite3 gave me the sqlite3_shutdown() API that
actually frees the extension attached via
sqlite3_reset_auto_extension() together with various other sqlite3
stuff. I do not see GDAL to call sqlite3_shutdown() anywhere and I
think it is quite reasonable to do it in some GDAL sqlite driver
finalization steps - in the OGRSQLiteBaseDataSource destructor, in the
Close() method after closing db,  etc.

GDAL is just a library. It may be integrated in an application that 
would use sqlite3 itself, and GDAL calling sqlite3_shutdown(), could 
case chaos in the application.

Subject: [gdal-dev] Call for review on RFC 107: Add OGRLayer::IGetExtent()
 and OGRLayer::ISetSpatialFilter()
Message-ID: <ff1d8176-4668-4ec9-93d4-5038fbdeac40@spatialys.com>

Hi,

Please review https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/11814: Add 
OGRLayer::IGetExtent() and OGRLayer::ISetSpatialFilter()

It could have gone through a pull request business-as-usual, but as this 
impacts a number of drivers, including out-of-tree ones, this is worth 
this small RFC.

Summary
-------

This RFC changes the prototype of the OGRLayer::GetExtent(), GetExtent3D(),
SetSpatialFilter() and SetSpatialFilterRect() methods.

Motivation
----------

Originally GetExtent(), SetSpatialFilter() and SetSpatialFilterRect() were
designed for a single geometry field. When support for multiple geometry 
fields
was added per :ref:`rfc-41`, alternate virtual methods were added to 
accept a
``int iGeomField`` argument, but this causes slightly repeating code 
patterns
in most drivers, and omissions of the boilerplate can cause bugs.

Subject: [gdal-dev] Issue Importing GML Files - HTTP 403
Message-ID: <CAHEdGZN=KA_ngek2vqtKweb590h7QFg3TY-BMRk7qDDT86KCAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm running the following loop to import GML files:

for file in *_ple.gml; do
  ogr2ogr --debug on -append -update -f gpkg CadastralParcel.gpkg "${file}"
CadastralParcel;
done

This is one of these files:
https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18725994/A094_AYAS_ple.gml.gz

GDAL gives me this error:

GML: Using Expat reader
GML: Global SRS = urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::6706
HTTP: Fetch(

http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2 http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.2.1/gml.xsd"

My question is:
- Is this "only" a formal issue, meaning that the files are probably
correctly imported despite the error?
- Or is it a blocking issue, and I should contact the data provider to fix
the schema reference?

Thanks in advance for your help,

Andrea

Andrea,

it would be best if the driver could access the schema, but this is not 
a fatal error. It will try to guess it from the XML content it.

Message-ID: <7F34242F-382E-44FD-A6C0-F4A0AE2879DE@hillcrestgeo.ca>

Hi,

I'd like to read an OpenFileGDB directly with ogr via /vsicurl//vsizip, but the file is named <file>.zip
Is there a config option I'm missing that will tell ogr that this is a valid zipped OpenFileGDB, or do I have to rename the file?

$ ogrinfo /vsizip//vsicurl/https://maps.kamloops.ca/OpenData/zipfiles/ParksGDB.zip
ERROR 4: `/vsizip//vsicurl/https://maps.kamloops.ca/OpenData/zipfiles/ParksGDB.zip' not recognized as being in a supported file format.
ogrinfo failed - unable to open '/vsizip//vsicurl/https://maps.kamloops.ca/OpenData/zipfiles/ParksGDB.zip'.

$ curl -o Parks.gdb.zip https://maps.kamloops.ca/OpenData/zipfiles/ParksGDB.zip
$ ogrinfo Parks.gdb.zip
INFO: Open of `Parks.gdb.zip'

thanks!

Simon,

no, there's no way currently to work around your use case, but I feel we 
should do something to support it. Please file an enhancement request at

Subject: [gdal-dev] GDAL 3.10.2 release candidate available
Message-ID: <e7564d38-cf8d-4eb5-bfd2-5d65c91ba1dc@spatialys.com>

Hi,

I have prepared a GDAL/OGR 3.10.2 release candidate, slightly ahead of 
what was
planned. The main trigger for it is the recent Poppler 25.02.00 release 
that breaks their
C++ unstable API and require code changes on our side. So rather than 
letting
each package maintainer cherry-picks the appropriate patch commit, let's 
issue
a clean release.

Pick up an archive among the following ones (by ascending size):

 ? https://download.osgeo.org/gdal/3.10.2/gdal-3.10.2rc1.tar.xz
 ? https://download.osgeo.org/gdal/3.10.2/gdal-3.10.2rc1.tar.gz
 ? https://download.osgeo.org/gdal/3.10.2/gdal3102rc1.zip

A snapshot of the gdalautotest suite is also available:

https://download.osgeo.org/gdal/3.10.2/gdalautotest-3.10.2rc1.tar.gz
https://download.osgeo.org/gdal/3.10.2/gdalautotest-3.10.2rc1.zip

The NEWS file is here:

Will this build against recent past as well as new poppler?  I couldn't
tell from NEWS.  In general some packaging systems are goign to update
to Poppler 25.02.00 and some won't have done so yet, especially because
poppler tends to break things in general.

I know I could read the code, but please consider this a NEWS micro-bug
report that a packager can't tell from reading, even though "gdal now
requires Poppler 25.0.2.00" is missing from NEWS and thus implies older
versions can still be used.

(gdal in pkgsrc doesn't build for pdf at all right now, which is on my
list to fix, but I suspect if there isn't detect-and-cope it will bite
others.)

Message-ID: <CE284F78-5049-4092-89E9-2EEDE2357D7A@gmail.com>

When opening a stac json file of multiple tiles, I?ll occasionally get a random error on one of the tiles like (probably due to government network issues). 

 

RuntimeError at /stac/featcollections/158703/items/vrt

Cannot open /vsicurl/https://grid.nga.mil/grid/api/file/stream/random_file_reference.tif?access_token=xxxxxx to retrieve band characteristics

 

And the whole stac feature collection read fails, rather than just the one tile that fails to read. Is there any way to not have the whole read fail and just ignore the one tile failure as an option (or retry)?

Hi,

Thanks again for the guidance and fix for below quoting issue several months ago.

The data source has kindly removed the spaces from their filename, quoting is no longer an issue.
Unfortunately with their update I'm now getting a different error that I can't debug (gdal 3.10.1):

ogrinfo \

Downloading the file with curl then reading with ogr works without issue:

curl -L -o transportation.gdb.zip https://governmentofbc.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/4bba119c2e9042d683cc9378fb1e836e/data
ogrinfo transportation.gdb.zip

      using driver `OpenFileGDB' successful.

Sorry for all the usage questions to the dev list - I'd be happy to take this somewhere else.

thanks

Simon

Hi list,

Using ogrinfo/ogr2ogr, I can't find the right config options to read data at this url: https://governmentofbc.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/4bba119c2e9042d683cc9378fb1e836e/data

Example command:
ogrinfo https://governmentofbc.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/4bba119c2e9042d683cc9378fb1e836e/data \
  --config CPL_VSIL_CURL_USE_HEAD=NO \
  --config CPL_CURL_VERBOSE=YES \
  --debug ON

I've tried a few additional config options, but can't tell what the problem is - the output from CURL_VERBOSE includes a GET to the appropriate new url, and it presumably uses the token without issue because it reports on the correct attachment:

CURL_INFO_HEADER_IN: Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="transportation.gdb.zip"; size=307145

I can download without issue using `curl --location-trusted` but would prefer to use ogr directly.

thanks!

Simon

Subject: [gdal-dev] GDAL 3.10.2 release candidate available
Message-ID: <d4a85ebc-af4b-256d-9267-da8a760c720@reclus2.nhh.no>

R-spatial for macOS static builds have run into a serious roadblock at 
3.10.1, so maybe an early 3.10.2 could assist us.

Until recently, static macOS builds of GDAL were using 3.5.3. Simon 
Urbanek (https://github.com/R-macos/recipes) has just converted the recipe 
for GDAL to cmake, and things were looking positive for 3.10.1, until we 
realised that:

-- Found CURL: 
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.3.sdk/usr/lib/libcurl.tbd 
(found version "7.64.1")
[...]
  checking whether CURLOPT_USERNAME is defined... yes
  checking whether CURLOPT_PASSWORD is defined... yes
  checking whether CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD is defined... yes
  checking whether CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE is defined... yes
  checking whether CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE is defined... yes
  checking whether CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE is defined... yes
  checking whether libcurl is version 7.66 or later?... no

so CURL is available but the MacOSX11.3.sdk version is insufficient - 
macOS 11.3 is the mandated build platform for R and R packages to 
accommodate most Darwin systems from older to newest.

Building GDAL on the cmake step says:

CURL component has been detected, but is disabled with GDAL_USE_CURL=OFF

during the building of GDAL itself, leading to errors in downstream R 
software:

GDAL/OGR not compiled with libcurl support, remote requests not supported.

in sf and terra if opening resources via URL, and in potentially all the 
1000+ packages using sf and terra. So unless this can be resolved, we'll 
probably have to go back to the last GDAL version not requiring >= 7.66 or 
whatever the threshold is and when it was changed.

On the macOS side, it isn't practicable to upgrade the system library for 
distribution to many users.

Is it possible to (optionally) specify a minimum CURL version of 7.64 say 
when calling cmake in GDAL 3.10? If there is no such possibility now, 
could it be added to 3.10.2 (RC2)? Where should I look to try to add a 
prototype change?

I didn't see a mention of the tightening of the CURL version requirement 
in the NEWS entries, but probably I'm looking in the wrong place.

Best wishes,

Roger

Roger,

curl >= 7.68 was made a requirement for GDAL 3.9 per 
https://gdal.org/en/stable/development/rfc/rfc98_build_requirements_gdal_3_9.html 
a bit more than one year ago.

You can try to downgrade the minimum version by patching 
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/51ee2933c08896648613488926bff36939a66be7/cmake/helpers/CheckDependentLibraries.cmake#L29 
and see if GDAL still builds with it. It might. This is just untested 
territory. If that builds, that should be fine. If that doesn't, minor 
patches might be needed.

Has it considered that R on Mac ships with a custom libcurl build that 
is up to date ? After all, if you ship an up-to-date GDAL why not 
shipping an up-to-date libcurl as well?

We are planning to use 3.8.5, the minor patches would have been of the 
larger kind of minor.

The R static build train provides libraries for R itself and all the 
packages for both architectures, based as far as possible on Xcode plus a 
Fortran compiler. So changing one central component isn't so attractive, 
as it may impact other libraries. For the Windows static binaries, MXE is 
used for cross-compilation, so more of the context is under our control.

I think 24h is way too fast for people to be able to test, so I would be

(3.10.2RC1 did build for me on NetBSD 10/amd64 and with it qgis opens my

Subject: [gdal-dev] Problem with warping into existing TIF
Message-ID: <CAK3fJgUSvG5qdTZQFDoS==CMKpkp3C8sF81KKKFod=wMiBuWZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Not sure if this is a bug, or expected behavior, or user error. If I warp
one TIF into another, and both have nodata masks, it seems that gdalwarp
isn't updating the destination TIF's nodata mask to unmask the new pixels.

Here's a short script to generate two example TIFs. One has a red box in
its upper left corner, the other has a green box in its upper right corner.
Both have nodata masks so that only the colored boxes are visible.

---
import numpy as np
from osgeo import gdal

gdal.UseExceptions()
gdal.SetConfigOption("GDAL_TIFF_INTERNAL_MASK", "YES")
drv = gdal.GetDriverByName("GTiff")

zeros = np.zeros((3, 1024, 1024))

red = np.copy(zeros)
red[0, 100:200, 100:200] = 255

green = np.copy(zeros)
green[1, 100:200, 800:900] = 255

ds = drv.Create("red.tif", 1024, 1024, 3, gdal.GDT_Byte)
ds.SetGeoTransform((0, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1))
ds.WriteArray(red)
ds.CreateMaskBand(gdal.GMF_PER_DATASET)
ds.GetRasterBand(1).GetMaskBand().WriteArray(red[0, :, :])
ds = None

ds = drv.Create("green.tif", 1024, 1024, 3, gdal.GDT_Byte)
ds.SetGeoTransform((0, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1))
ds.WriteArray(green)
ds.CreateMaskBand(gdal.GMF_PER_DATASET)
ds.GetRasterBand(1).GetMaskBand().WriteArray(green[1, :, :])
ds = None
---

Then if you copy red.tif to warp.tif, then warp green.tif into warp.tif:
cp red.tif warp.tif
gdalwarp green.tif warp.tif

I would expect the result to be a combined image with both the red and
green boxes. But when I load this result into QGIS, I only see the red box.
If I change the layer in QGIS to ignore the mask band, I do see both boxes
(and the remaining image is black, as expected). So the pixel data is
there, but the mask didn't get updated.

Is there a way to get gdalwarp to update the nodata mask automatically?
Maybe some hidden setting I'm missing? I can work around this by separately
warping the masks, then copying the result into the final TIF's mask band.
But it would be nice if the warp took care of this for me.

Thanks

Subject: [gdal-dev] Debugging mask copy issues when using Band interleaved
 COGs
Message-ID: <CAMfruOhK5HsG0FuLYoMrLDqpZvbVDRr8MqWzZPd2_haxc8EnDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I work with Kurt Schwehr, and we've been debugging failures where an
explicit mask isn't preserved through a CreateCopy operation to create a
COG through the GTiff driver at HEAD.

This failure only started occurring after
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/commit/3bdc81a205bad8342688873e4ed5716f1208e8f5
.

After the CreateCopy, when we read back the mask, the mask is expanded from
the 1-bit mask to the 8-bit mask inside of gtiffoddbitsband.h. However, the
mask is not a 1-bit mask when I add logging here; instead, it's the
original 8-bit mask (with 255s and 0s). So when it gets expanded to 8-bits,
it's no longer the original mask:
E.g., 255 0 255 255 becomes 255 255 ... 255 255 0 0 ... 0 0 255 255 ...

So my guess is that somewhere along the line we either copy the mask
without turning it back into a bitmask, or we lose metadata tracking that
the mask is encoded a certain way.

Does anything obvious jump out to folks here? The issue *does not* occur
when either COPY_SRC_OVERVIEWS="YES" is removed or INTERLEAVE is set to
PIXEL (it only fails on band interleaving).

Here's a gist containing an example test that fails at head but previously
succeeded: https://gist.github.com/orglofch/40cf4d9136978b0384141cc74d1039b6
.

Thanks,
Owen

Tim,

Reviewing the warping logic, I see we have support for a *input* mask, 
but not creating/updating an *output* mask. AFAICS, there isn't any 
particular strong reason not to have support for that. Likely just a few 
hours of coding away. Your best workaround is to generate an output with 
an alpha band (possibly as a VRT) and use gdal.Translate(dst, src, 
options="-b 1 -b 2 -b 3 -mask 4") for example to transform a RGBA into a 
RGB+mask product

Message-ID: <CACh_PwNUeMPWwXRD4R6gky2vys3zUiK9O95TBhP54ReN+Ny=BQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am looking for functionality to create a VRT of multiple rasters where
the VRT pixel value is the maximum of underlying rasters pixel values.

I found out that we have pixel functions
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2016-September/045134.html that
we can add to VRTs to get this behavior but just checking to see if there
is a direct way to specify this in gdalbuildvrt command line call or do one
has to manually inject this in VRT xml.

On the same note does the new gdaltileindex provide this functionality of
selecting the max value for each pixel out of the box?

Hi Abdul,

For the specific case of multiple rasters that share the same extent, the
next release of GDAL should have a replacement "gdal_calc" that would take
multiple inputs and write a VRT that applies an expression to those inputs
("max", in your case). In the meantime, I think your best option would be
to prepare the VRT yourself.

Thanks for your reply, my rasters are not sharing extent but some do
overlap.

How about GTI, Does that provide this functionality? Do you know.

Any preliminary documentation on this?

Hi,

I suggest continuing the discussion in other forums than GitHub issues or gdal-dev. I do not suggest being a coward and fall silent but finding a better media.

Where? When it's a fascist state we're all at fault.

I knew this wouldn't last but I absolutely supported it, silently, from the

This is the slope. Good luck everyone, be brave
