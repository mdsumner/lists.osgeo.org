Subject: GDAL Moving
Message-ID: <393E6323.116D75DF@h...>

Folks,

As I have promised for a long time, GDAL is moving to remotesensing.org for
more reliable CVS service, and to give real anonymous access. I have left
the old GDAL and OGR tree on gdal.velocet.ca for now, but please don't commit
any changes to it. Information on the new location will be available 
at http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/ as I get things moved over and fixed up.

Best regards,

Hi,

I was just wondering if OGR feature style questions are relevant to 
this group or is it totally off topic?

S.-P.

Simon-Pierre,

It would probbaly not be too much off-topic here since GDAL and OGR are
kind of related to each other, but OGR-related issues are usually
discussed on the SFCOM-DEV list:

Daniel,

I have fixed up the configure so that if python isn't found the rest of
the configure will still succeed (but python support is disabled). You can
also explicitly force python support to be skipped via the --without-python
configure switch. 

I don't have any platforms without python handy. Could you try the 
latest out of CVS and let me know if it works?

Unfortunately there are a number of dependencies between OGR and GDAL. 
For instance, the gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/sdts depends on gdal/frmts/iso8211
and gdal/frmts/sdts. Regular raster GDAL depends on some coordinate
transform related stuff out of the gdal/ogr directory. 

In theory if you want OGR you should be able to do a configure in 
the gdal directory, then a make in the gdal/port directory, and then a
make in the gdal/ogr directory. In practice you will also need to do
a make in the gdal/frmts/iso8211, and gdal/frmts/sdts directories.

I will think on this.

Guys,

I have added Eosat Fast Format support (gdal/frmts/raw/effdataset.cpp).

Dear Frank and all developers,

I just checked out GDAL from OSRS CVS and tried to compile it. I got
an error in 'frmts' directory:

Is "o/" in "o/gdalallregister.o" meant to be a new directory, is it a
typo, or something else?

Thanks!

Aleksey,

There should be a gdal/frmts/o directory created when you check out of
CVS. The only thing it will contain initially is the CVS directory. Is
it not there? If not, you could create it by hand, but something apparently
went wrong in your checkout ... you might want to recreate the whole tree. 

Let me know what happens.

Frank,

I had -P (prune) option for cvs checkout, that's why... Thanks!

Message-ID: <3959FD00.BC39EBC3@h...>


Folks,

In order to facilitate the use of OGR by OpenEV (see openev.sourceforge.net)
I have added a configure option to GDAL called ``--with-ogr'' which will cause
the OGR libraries, including all the supported drivers, to be compiled and
linked into the libgdal.1.1.so library. 

Let me know if this causes any problems. 

Best regards,
