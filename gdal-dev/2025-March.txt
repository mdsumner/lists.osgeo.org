Does it also happen without S3, just with local files?
It would simplify the analysis

Aha, yes, it does appear to happen just with local files. In my attempts to
create a reproduce case yesterday, I overlooked that part. I did try it
early on but just with a single TIF in the VRT, in which case it does the
right thing and raises an exception. But with two TIFs and one missing, it
behaves as I explained with /vsis3.

So create two TIFs and a VRT, then remove one TIF:
gdal_create -of GTiff -outsize 1000 1000 -bands 1 -a_srs EPSG:4326 -a_ullr
0 1 1 0 input1.tif
gdal_create -of GTiff -outsize 1000 1000 -bands 1 -a_srs EPSG:4326 -a_ullr
1 1 2 0 input2.tif
gdalbuildvrt input.vrt input1.tif input2.tif
rm input2.tif

Then in Python:
from osgeo import gdal
gdal.UseExceptions()

This raises an exception
gdal.Warp("output.tif", "input.vrt", callback=gdal.TermProgress)

But this does not:
gdal.Warp("output.tif", "input.vrt", callback=gdal.TermProgress,
multithread=True)

Hi Tim,

UseExceptions() might only affect your main thread. You may want to check
in GDAL's code to see if this is the case. At any rate, you won't be able
to handle Python exceptions that you might see raised from the warp threads.

Hope this helps,

I'm trying to debug it in my machine. But after building in debug mode
enabling the environment with
. ../scripts/setdevenv.sh
the exceptions are not thrown any more in python (neither with
multithread=False)

Subject: [gdal-dev] GDAL Maintainers Meeting Minutes
Message-ID: <2752BE16-B4CD-4F98-AA00-E39BAA2EB6FA@hobu.co>

Howard Butler, Dan Baston, Alessandro Pasotti, Norman Barker, Daniel Morissette, Kurt Schwehr, Jukka Rahkonen, Michael Sumner, and Javier Jimenez Shaw held the monthly GDAL Maintainers Meeting on 02/27/2025. The following items were discussed and reported upon:

Project News
----------------------------

* Even engaged two potential part-time (~ half a day / week each) documentation maintainers who are enthusiastic to be supported by the GDAL Sponsorship Program to improve documentation needs highlighted by last fall's GDAL User Survey. A GDAL PSC member is needed to engage with and commit to managing them to continue moving it forward.
* GDAL 3.10.2 "Gulf of Mexico"  was released https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/v3.10.2/NEWS.md
* libgeotiff 1.7.4 was released https://github.com/OSGeo/libgeotiff/releases/tag/1.7.4

Maintenance activities update
------------------------------------------

Alessandro

* gdal_contour bug fixing https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/11564 to correct how levels and ranges were set by users or interpreted from the incoming data
* Implemented synchronization of OGR layer definition with savepoint mechanisms in GeoPackage and SQLite drivers (started as a QGIS bug but was decided it was best fixed in GDAL https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/59797#issuecomment-2544133498)

Dan

* 'gdal raster calc', which is a no-python implementation that depends on the recently added GDAL VRT expression capabilities to lazily compute raster operations https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/11850
* 20+ PRs
* Accumulated stats and potential usage information from website format-specific driver pages to gage 

Even did not attend but provided the following text updates:

* RFC 106: Metadata items to reflect driver update capabilities https://gdal--11862.org.readthedocs.build/en/11862/development/rfc/rfc106_update_metadata.html
* RFC 107: IGetExtent / ISetSpatialFilter https://gdal--11862.org.readthedocs.build/en/11862/development/rfc/rfc107_igetextent_isetspatialfilter.html
* RFC 108: Driver removal for GDAL 3.11 https://gdal--11862.org.readthedocs.build/en/11862/development/rfc/rfc108_driver_removal_3_11.html
* Related to RFC 108, dropping as a maintainer of libogdi (this library probably no longer makes sense for anyone, the to-be-dropped OGR OGDI driver being likely its only user)
* Implementation of "gdal vector select" and "gdal vector sql"
* Implementation of "gdal raster mosaic" and "gdal raster stack"
* Brainstorming about a "gdal vector geom_op": https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/11826
* Usual mix of random fixes and pull request reviews


The next GDAL Maintainers Meeting is 03/27/2024 at 13:00 UTC. GDAL PSC members and PR contributors are welcome to join by reaching out to me for an invite.

Howard

Subject: [gdal-dev] Motion: Add Michael Smith to GDAL PSC
Message-ID: <f5ba6bf1-2dc4-4d8a-aa43-3f68941be826@mapgears.com>

Hi PSC members,

I would like to nominate Michael Smith to become a member of the GDAL 
Project Steering Committee.

   https://www.osgeo.org/member/michael-smith/

Mike is a long time GDAL power user and contributor/supporter.  He is 
also very active in several other OSGeo projects including as member of 
the MapServer and PDAL project PSC's and was actually one of the 
instigators behind the PDAL project, the GDAL of Point Clouds.

Mike has been active on the OSGeo Board since 2014 as treasurer. Given 
his years of experience with the management of open source projects (and 
non-coding activities), a side benefit of having him on the GDAL PSC is 
that he could also help us with managing the sponsorship program and the 
NumFocus relationship and take some of this operational work off 
Howard's shoulders.

I start with my +1

Daniel

Subject: [gdal-dev] Mute HDF5-DIAG diagnostic output
Message-ID: <CAAuDOj_c4TL0De31LVgEVN3errVtqFGufbjt7uditHaMB7Wu_A@mail.gmail.com>

 <https://gis.stackexchange.com/posts/490841/timeline>

Dear GDAL devs,

I am using GDAL 3.8.4 and have some tests in a Rust codebase that check
behavior on trying to open non-existing NetCDF files, non-existing groups
within the NetCDF, etc.

I am working with the dataset by opening it as a multidimensional GDAL
dataset and then use GDALGroupOpenGroup, etc.

The testing works fine, but I am getting loads of diagnostic messages from
the underlying NetCDF library.

HDF5-DIAG: Error detected in HDF5 (1.10.10) thread 3:
  #000: ../../../src/H5A.c line 484 in H5Aopen_by_name(): can't open attribute
    major: Attribute
    minor: Can't open object
  #001: ../../../src/H5Aint.c line 542 in H5A__open_by_name(): unable

H5O__attr_open_by_name(): can't locate attribute:
'_QuantizeGranularBitRoundNumberOfSignificantDigits'

    minor: Object not found


How can I mute these HDF5-DIAG messages?

I tried sending GDAL's error logging to /dev/null but this does not change
anything.


Best regards

I take it https://docs.rs/gdal/latest/gdal/config/fn.set_error_handler.html doesn't work? Can you try e.g. gdal.PushErrorHandler('CPLQuietErrorHandler') in Python to make sure?

Tim,

wil be solved (in 3.11 only) per https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/11915

In the meantime, check for gdal.Warp() return value: if None, an error

Hello,

I figured a way around this, and to be completely honest this issue was coming up from using the DIMAP files (for Pleiades NEO and HR) for the panchromatic and multispectral images and so were loaded with the DIMAP driver.

1. My images for input to pansharpening had no geotransform, as they were generated through several math processing steps using the DIMAP files (for Pleiades NEO and HR) for the panchromatic and multispectral images and so were loaded with the DIMAP driver. The Geotransform was of the form (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0), and this makes gdal_pansharpen unhappy.
2. I set the geotransform to that of one of the tif files (formatted with RxCx, using the first one) that contains a geotransform that makes sense for the origin of the image and RPCs, i.e., R1C1 i.e., the upper leftmost image in the delivery. This geotransform matches well enough to make pansharpening happy across the full dataset extent.
3. On the pansharpened result, remove the geotransform with gdal_edit.py -unsetgt <file> and copy in the RPCs from the original DIMAP file.

This produces a file that can be used downstream for orthorectification or any other operations utilizing the RPCs.

Thanks for the input!

Cheers,
Joe

Hi Jukka,

That is almost exactly along the lines of what I was thinking: fake the geotransform  and CRS data to get past the non-existent CRS data within this level of imagery, and then copy back in the appropriate metadata. Thanks for your response! I'll give it a try.

Cheers,
Joe

EXTERNAL SENDER. DO NOT click links, or open attachments, if the sender is unknown, or the message seems suspicious in any way. DO NOT provide your user ID or Password.





Hi,



I have never done anything with RPCs, but maybe you could remove RPCs with something like ?gdal_translate -co profile=baseline input.tif output.tif? (delete the aux.xml or use that magic config option that I do not remember out of my head), define some fake geotransformation by defining same ullr coordinates and crs for both PAN and MS images, then pansharpen, and finally copy the RPCs back like you have done before. I apologize if this does not make any sense.

My apologies for the repost, was not aware that is against the rules of the list-serv. noted!



The workflow I described, pansharpening on data in image space, is a common practice. This being deprecated was surprising to see as a user, but I understand the reasoning in the migration notes. If I end up determining a workflow that allows similar functionality with gdal > 3.6, I'll be sure to respond accordingly for the benefit of the community.



As for the rest of the reply, from one working professional to another, I'll look past it. thanks!

Joe,



Ask the AI from AiDASH to tell you how to do it? Oh, right, the GDAL list is your training corpus, not the inference data.



Sorry for being snotty, but please refrain from reposting questions to the list like this. If no one answered your question the first time, the LLM hallucinates and pukes out-of-order GDAL arguments at you, and you cannot dig through the source code and documentation to figure it out yourself, you should hire a consultant. https://gdal.org/en/stable/community/service_providers.html is a list of a few, and inspecting the commit history of the repository should give you some inspiration for others to privately contact.

Any advice on how to pansharpen image space data with RPCs in gdal >= 3.7?? Repeating below.



Hello,



I saw in the migration notes from GDAL 3.6 -> 3.7:

- Pansharpening now requires that panchromatic and multispectral bands have valid geotransform (in early versions, it was assumed in the case of missing   geotransform that they covered the same geospatial extent).  The undocumented VRT pansharpened MSShiftX and MSShiftY options (and the  corresponding C++ GDALPansharpenOptions::dfMSShiftX and dfMSShiftY members)  have been removed, due to using the inverted convention as one would expect,  and being sub-par solution compared to using geotransform to correlate pixels  of panchromatic and multispectral bands.



Previously, I had been taking a PAN and MS set of images with RPCs and running gdal_pansharpen, then copying over the RPCs from the PAN file, then continuing on in my workflow. This no long works past GDAL 3.6, so is there a recommended workflow for doing this? I've been able to "gdalwarp -rpc" the files prior to calling gdal_pansharpen, but i'd like to retain the image in image space with RPCs if possible.



thanks,

Joe

at all.

# Ubuntu 24 LTS version
pip install gdal[numpy]=="3.8.4.*"

*<test.py>*
from osgeo import gdal

rootGroup = dataset.GetRootGroup()
print(rootGroup.GetGroupNames())

rootGroup.OpenGroup('scenario_6')

    return _gdal.Group_OpenGroup(self, *args)

This is what I would hope for, but it is strange indeed.

I guess that's because you're enabling exceptions, but even without them I get no error logging at all, at least on the file I tried with.

Hi there,

In our application, we integrate GDAL (3.8.4 with proj 9.4.0) in order to deals with geographic projections and data loading.
To improve loading & processing time we use multithreading.
Until now everything was right, but we start dealing with dataset expressed on EPSG:28992 (Amersfoort / RD New -- Netherlands - Holland - Dutch).
Then our application starts to crash. After some investigations, it appears that PROJ is modifying the pipeline used to perform transformation.
(Into pipeline, some pop operation)

We use OGRCoordinateTransformation into a wrapper, each Transformation object is unique throught the whole application (I.E. one object to convert EPSG:4326 to EPSG:28992).
For now this implementation works wells (At least for UTM / Lambert / WorldMercator, maybe anothers) but for this particular one don't.

Did we miss something ? Should we have a threadlocal based implementation on OGRCoordinateTransformation object ?

Thanks !

Yes, one OGRCoordinateTransformation object per thread. See 
https://gdal.org/en/stable/user/multithreading.html : "Unless otherwise 
stated, no GDAL public C functions and C++ methods should be assumed to 
be thread-safe. That is you should not call simultaneously GDAL 
functions from multiple threads on the same data instance"

Hi all,

A little off topic for GDAL as I'm not suggesting GDAL needs a driver for
this.

Does anyone know of tools other than McIDAS-X / McIDAS-V for reading older

One example file:

Subject: [gdal-dev] Creating Mosaic - Ensuring Maximum Pixel Value is
 brought forward
Message-ID: <CAOHJxn5UimEHRJxFBfW4r+mr=jN6h0Osd4GgqT9gixJ2yjOGUw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Developers,

I am working on generating a mosaic, and I need to ensure that the maximum
pixel value (dBZ) is selected when merging overlapping raster files.
Despite my attempts using gdalbuildvrt and gdalwarp, I continue to
encounter issues where it does not always pick the maximum pixel value in
overlapping areas.

notes: CRS is EPSG:4326 and GDAL 3.8.5, released 2024/04/02

Commands Used:

1.
gdalwarp -overwrite -multi -r
max  /nfs/radar/max-reflectivity/tiff/raw/*/2025/3/5/20250305T2145*.tif
test-20250305T2145.png.composite.tif
or
gdalbuildvrt test-20250305T2145.png.composite.vrt
/nfs/radar/max-reflectivity/tiff/raw/*/2025/3/5/20250305T2145*.tif

gdalwarp -overwrite -q -r max test-20250305T2145.png.composite.vrt
test-20250305T2145.png.composite.tif


2.

gdaldem color-relief -alpha -q test-20250305T2145.composite.tif \
/color-ramps/reflectivity/titan.txt \ test-20250305T2145.png
*Questions:*

   1. How can I ensure that gdalbuildvrt properly stacks overlapping
   rasters while keeping the maximum pixel values?
   2. Is gdalwarp -r max the correct approach to pick the highest dBZ
   reflectivity values?

Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in
advance for your help.

With Regards,

Hello

We have a slightly renamed GDAL DLLs for e.g. gdal393.dll and hence the below NuGet packages that are built for .NET Framework won't work with our DLLs.
https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=MaxRev.Gdal



So, Is there a fork for these NUGET Packages which we can look at ?

I would use one of the NuGet packages that are built for .NET Framework

https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=MaxRev.Gdal

These should suffice, rather than building the bindings yourself.

Hello

I am trying to build GDAL CSharp bindings from v3.9.3 branch<https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/tree/v3.9.3/swig/csharp>.

The documentation for v3.9.3<https://gdal.org/en/stable/api/csharp/csharp_compile_cmake.html#net-build-toolchain> states that it needs .NET 5.0 OR Mono

[cid:459f78aa-7867-445a-8c18-cbdc80f04432]

Question : Is it possible to build GDAL source v3.9.3 using DOT NET Framework 4.8 or less? I am using below flags BUT it seems the build process is attempting to look for only .NET SDK and not the DOT NET FRAMEWORK

??????<arg value="-DBUILD_CSHARP_BINDINGS=ON"/><!-- C# Bindings-->
??????<arg value="-DCSHARP_LIBRARY_VERSION=4.8"/>
??????<arg value="-DCSHARP_APPLICATION_VERSION=4.8"/>


Does GDAL still support building CSharp Bindings with .net framework?

Please let me know.

Parveen

Hi,

You can let cmake to build the csharp libs for netstandard2.0
("-DCSHARP_LIBRARY_VERSION=netstandard2.0") which makes it compatible with
both the netframework and netcore versions.

Best regards,

Tamas

Hello tamas

I am trying to build with these options

<arg value="-DBUILD_CSHARP_BINDINGS=ON"/><!-- C# Bindings-->
<arg value="-DCSHARP_LIBRARY_VERSION=netstandard2.0"/>
<arg value="-DCSHARP_APPLICATION_VERSION=netstandard2.0"/>


However, I am getting errors wrt to finding the executables like OGRInfo.exe etc among others

[INFO]      [exec]   -- Installing: C:/workarea/Source/gdal/build_Debug/install/share/csharp/OgrInfo/OgrInfo.deps.json
[INFO]      [exec]   CMake Error at swig/csharp/cmake_install.cmake:152 (file):
[INFO]      [exec]     file INSTALL cannot find
[INFO]      [exec]     "C:/workarea/Source/gdal/build_Debug/swig/csharp/OgrInfo/OgrInfo.exe":




My question : If I set CMAKE OPTIONS as shown to "netstandard2.0" then do i expect to see the EXEs getting generated as I understand that .NET STANDARD is just specification and not any runtime. Will these make any difference?

Best regards,

Hello

I am trying to build GDAL CSharp bindings from v3.9.3 branch<https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/tree/v3.9.3/swig/csharp>.

The documentation for v3.9.3<https://gdal.org/en/stable/api/csharp/csharp_compile_cmake.html#net-build-toolchain> states that it needs .NET 5.0 OR Mono

[cid:ii_1956ab8f04dcb971f161]

Question : Is it possible to build GDAL source v3.9.3 using DOT NET Framework 4.8 or less? I am using below flags BUT it seems the build process is attempting to look for only .NET SDK and not the DOT NET FRAMEWORK

??????<arg value="-DBUILD_CSHARP_BINDINGS=ON"/><!-- C# Bindings-->
??????<arg value="-DCSHARP_LIBRARY_VERSION=4.8"/>
??????<arg value="-DCSHARP_APPLICATION_VERSION=4.8"/>


Does GDAL still support building CSharp Bindings with .net framework?

Please let me know.

Best regards,
Parveen

Hi,

The sample applications should be compiled to net5.0 or above:

"-DCSHARP_LIBRARY_VERSION=netstandard2.0"
"-DCSHARP_APPLICATION_VERSION=net5.0"

image warping work these days!

Subject: [gdal-dev] FlatGeobuf Layer vs Feature Columns
Message-ID: <CADXYQQ6zQ8iASqcjrJJ0okAA3gAFqW7_qUu4KPE-K95j74dueg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I translated some geojson to flatgeobuf where the geojson features have a
variable number of properties (e.g. some features have a bunch of
translations for the name of a place pulled from OSM).

I noticed in the ogrinfo output that while the summary info has all the
fields possible,

name: String (0.0)
name:ar: String (0.0)
name:bn: String (0.0)
...etc...

each feature prints out just its actual fields associated with it:

OGRFeature(layer):1
  name (String) = Huselva
  LINESTRING (-36.7425039 -54.1973051 ...etc..)

I had expected a bunch of NULL values for all the fields not set, much like
what QGIS shows or what happens if I translate to e.g. geoparquet.

In the flatgeobuf spec, I noticed it supports a per feature schema

https://github.com/flatgeobuf/flatgeobuf/blob/3d488b384a911b3a18d8b28ee730fb8f3831a39b/src/fbs/header.fbs#L75

Is ogr taking advantage of this? Or is it just aware that those fields were
never set for that feature?

I am asking because if I was to create the flatgeobuf directly with OGR, I
am not sure if I need to call CreateField on the layer itself for all
possible fields, or can I do something per feature?

Thanks!

If your using ogr2ogr try using the switch -emptyStrAsNull if you're not.

 Hello,I wanted to add my opinion here too. If there is an active development of GPU based warping (or any other gdal functionality) then I would like to get involved. I know the OpenCL was there for many years but I never was able to use it.
Could you please elaborate about the active work by Seth? Would like to test it out.
Have a great day,Conrad

Message-ID: <CALRbqOQks7fZa4is8=EV+Gw3xiWX5b+daBbXmmiS1a+6UEpRDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
The SQLite / Spatialite RDBMS driver says "SQLite is an optionally compiled
in driver. It is not compiled in by default." It seems fairly ubiquitous
though. Is that a safe assumption (more or less), or are there important
caveats to know about? I know that SQLite could be present without
SpatiaLite support, but I'm wondering about the SQLite driver for "regular"
SQLite databases, with or without SpatiaLite.

Thanks!

Hi,

Proj requires SQLite anyway and you may want to do coordinate transformations with GDAL. Without SpatiaLite you?ll miss only the SpatiaLite SQL functions, and of course support for SpatiaLite databases.

Right, libsqlite3 is definitely ubiquitous, and I always want libspatialite
too. But that is different from whether the GDAL vector  driver "SQLite /
Spatialite RDBMS" is compiled in, which it is not by default. That would
depend more on whether various package management systems choose to enable
it in their distributions, for example. Or if there are reasons that custom
builds would tend to exclude it sometimes. My sense is that the driver is
generally available even though it's optional at build time. Just wondering
if there are known exceptions to be aware of, or if my assumptions above
are wrong? Why is it an optionally compiled in driver given ubiquity of
SQLite? Just because GPKG mostly fulfills that need and is standard?

Hi,

The SQLite driver has a long history, I guess it was originally made to support FDO https://web.archive.org/web/20240811210751/https://trac.osgeo.org/fdo/wiki/FDORfc16<https://web.archive.org/web/20240811210751/https:/trac.osgeo.org/fdo/wiki/FDORfc16>.
By that time there was no other use for SQLite so making it optional was probably natural.

Interesting! Thanks for pointing me to that. Appreciate knowing the
history. Your explanation for it becoming optional makes sense.

Partly I was just curious that the SQLite driver is not built in by
default, since today GDAL build requires PROJ, PROJ requires libsqlite3,
and so the dependency is always there since SQLite driver can be be built
with or without libspatialite. (I'm not advocating necessarily that SQLite
driver *should* be built in by default.)

The practical motivation for asking is that SQLite driver supports multiple
geometry columns on a layer which GPKG does not. It's simple to test for
availability of SQLite and SpatiaLite before attempting to use them of
course, but wondered if there's any general sense of potential for SQLite
driver tending to be unavailable in some cases. It's not uncommon that
SpatiaLite is unavailable to GDAL on some platforms I encounter, even
though it seems mostly available in general.

Message-ID: <CAPrLoNd1b4XMSa9w8OhCs6eNYdbuJp7mNL9Gk83wxGK6XCvStQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Community,

The Java GDAL bindings provide the method

    public int[] GetDataAxisToSRSAxisMapping(SWIGTYPE_p_int nLen,
SWIGTYPE_p_p_int pList)

The corresponding [C++ function][1] is

    const std::vector< int > &
OGRSpatialReference::GetDataAxisToSRSAxisMapping ()    const

The Java method is not documented: [Java Docs for
GetDataAxisToSRSAxisMapping][2]

The data axis to SRS axis mapping should return an array and take no
arguments. What should be provided as `SWIGTYPE_p_int nLen,
SWIGTYPE_p_p_int pList` in Java to get data axis to SRS axis mapping?

Subject: [gdal-dev] Zarr BLOCKSIZE in gdalmdimtranslate with variables of
 varying dimension
Message-ID: <CANzGYpTSwkP2V8cGspmPEzDQF_Rrc5gSJD+7c4JY7mYSh+acSw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

  gdalmdimtranslate is a very handy tool e.g. to translate netCDF
files to Zarr as it can handle huge files that xarray just chokes on.
   I have a question regarding handling output blocksizes for the Zarr
format for files with variables of varying dimensions though. For
example I need to translate a netCDF file with time, z, lat, lon
dimensions and variables which are either 4D (time, z, lat, lon), 3D
(time, lat, lon) and 2D (lat, lon). I would like to remap chunksizes /
blocksizes to better suit my use case. However, it seems that I can
only specify blocksizes as e.g. -co ARRAY:BLOCKSIZE 2, 2, 128, 128 -
which will throw an error and skip the variables that don't  have 4
dimensions. Also, the output doesn't contain the dimension variables
in this case. Likewise, for 4D variables if I only specify 3
blocksizes.
  Have tried this with gdal versions 3.8.4 and 3.4.1 with similar results.
   So the question is if there is any way to specify blocksizes e.g.
by dimension name? Or if the approach should rather be to just create
3 output Zarr folders - one for each variable dimensionality (2D, 3D
and 4D)? I can of course manually "merge" these folders afterwards.

Best regards,
Simon

Subject: [gdal-dev] Motion: approve use of GDAL Sponsorship Program funds
 for 2 documentation contributors
Message-ID: <b15e3da8-b8b4-4ad1-8aa5-cb4df197b9c7@spatialys.com>

Hi,

Seth Girvin (https://github.com/geographika) and Harrissou Sant-anna 
(DelazJ) are interested in contributing improvements to the GDAL 
documentation, one of the most recurring item where enhancements are 
wished from the feedback we got through the User Survey last November. 
Both have experience on documentation of open source geospatial software 
(respectively on Mapserver for Seth and QGIS for Harrissou) and are 
excited to bring it to GDAL. This is understood this will be a small 
part time activity for both of them. Dan Baston has kindly agreed to 
supervise their work, regarding initial setup, review of pull requests 
and filing in documentation tickets for planned tasks in the issue 
tracker. We will also welcome Seth and Harrissou inputs.

A non-exhaustive list of the potential different activities is:

- Adding more examples to existing documentation (typically for command 
line utilities)
- Systematic addition of docstrings for Python API
- Adding tutorial-like material (with graphics when appropriate), 
illustrating workflows that can combine several tools to produce a 
desired outcome
- Adding a user-focused, example-driven introduction to the project on 
gdal.org and github.com/OSGeo/GDAL, ala README of 
https://github.com/qgis/qgis
- Harmonization of presentation of existing documentation / making it 
more easy to find content
- Hierarchisation of content in existing documentation. For popular 
tools or drivers, it could probably be interesting to have "basic" and 
"advanced" sections (typically for the GeoTIFF page that could/should 
probably be split)

Motion: approve use of up to 25,000 euros for Seth Girvin and up to 
25,000 euros for Harrissous Sant-anna from the GDAL Sponsorship Program, 
for the period April 1st 2025 - March 31st 2026, on documentation 
enhancements for GDAL.

Starting with my +1,

Even
