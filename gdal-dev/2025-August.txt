Subject: [gdal-dev] Masked histogram calculation
Message-ID: <CO1PR01MB7243EABB8747CF081C5A3324F921A@CO1PR01MB7243.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hi everyone, I?ve been using GetHistogram but I need to support rasters with alpha channels and those run through nearblack. I don?t see masked histogramming mentioned in the docs. I do see the masked read functions, but it looks like numpy?s masked array histogram function is one of many ma functions that don't work correctly(?) (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10019)

Does anyone have any creative ideas to share?

For masked data, the simplest seems to be iteratively histogramming manually masked blocks.

It looks like nearblack can handle >4 bands, but I need multibyte dtypes. I was thinking of rasterizing a VRT that uses the new equations system to compute  A | (A >> 8) or maybe a two step equivalent of bool(A) -> sum(A) and running that through nearblack to make an alpha channel for the above method.


Appreciate everyone?s thoughts.

Message-ID: <CALRbqORzdGH0-_RDX9ehRZz9NV0nStZ10Bkz+dZmuYGM7ZH5-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
In the C API there is GDALAlgorithmArgHasDefaultValue(), but no
interface to the GetDefault() class method to access the value itself
when there is one (nor in the Python bindings, AFAICS).

I don't believe there is a fromHandle() method on GDALAlgorithmArg to
get to the C++ object.

Is there possibly a workaround for that when working through the C API?

Hi Chris,

This was indeed missing in the C API. Queued for 3.12 in 
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/12853

If you need this in 3.11, you can define the following implementation 
detail in your code

struct GDALAlgorithmArgHS
{
 ??? GDALAlgorithmArg *ptr = nullptr;

 ??? explicit GDALAlgorithmArgHS(GDALAlgorithmArg *arg) : ptr(arg)
 ??? {
 ??? }
};

but better conditionalize it to 3.11 only, so that to avoid issues in 
later version if we would change the definition of struct GDALAlgorithmArgHS

and then do things like

GDALAlgorithmArgH hArg;

hArg->ptr->GetDefault<std::string>();

Message-ID: <etPan.68909730.264f62fe.23f5@rtwilson.com>

Hi,

I?ve just started experimenting with the new gdal command line tools.

I?ve tried the following command to merge a few thousand GeoJSON files into one GeoPackage:

gdal vector concat --mode=single gb-postcodes-v5/units/*.geojson all_unit_postcodes.gpkg

I get thousands of errors like:

ERROR 4: gb-postcodes-v5/units/KY4.geojson: Too many open files

Switching back to ogrmerge, I find that this command works fine:

ogrmerge -single -progress -o all_unit_postcodes_v2.gpkg gb-postcodes-v5/units/*.geojson

Has there been a change which means that gdal vector concat tries to open all the files in parallel, and then runs out of spare file handles? Is there any way around this for the new gdal vector concat command?

Best regards,

Robin

Robin,

this was an oversight of the implementation of gdal vector concat. Fixed 
per https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/12856

Apart from using ogrmerge, a workaround is to increate the limit of open 
files with "ulimit -n some_number"

Could GDALAlgorithmArgHS be defined in gdalalgorithm.h (as struct
GDALAlgorithmHS is)?

Chris,

why would you need it to be exposed ? If it is to workaround missing C 
API entry points, we should add them

Regarding struct GDALAlgorithmHS being exposed in gdalalgorithm.h, this 
is because another GDAL .cpp file needed it, but I think I should create 
instead a gdalalgorithm_priv.h header to move those struct definitions. 
Please don't rely on the internals of struct GDALAlgorithmHS

Even,
Got it, thanks.

I'm thinking of the case analogous to GDALDataset, OGRGeometry and
others that have a fromHandle() method. That is occasionally helpful,
when we use primarily the C APIs but there is some public C++ method
not exposed in C that we want to use (i.e., "public" via gdal_priv.h
in the case of dataset). But yeah a workaround there too, not needed
often.

WIth GDALAlgorithmArg there is a "hidden" flag that can be accessed
with GDALAlgorithmArg::IsHidden(). It seems to to mean the arg is
hidden in both CLI and non-CLI "application" contexts, i.e., should
not be given as a user option in either context? In the C API there is
GDALAlgorithmArgIsHiddenForCLI() and GDALAlgorithmArgIsOnlyForCLI(),
but with those I can't tell for sure if the arg should be hidden
either way (e.g., "help-doc" but potentially others it looks like).

Chris,

in the 3.11 branch "help-doc" is the only argument that calls 
SetHidden(), so you could hard code that for now, or use the workaround 
of defining the struct GDALAlgorithmArgHS

For 3.12, I've exposed GDALAlgorithmArgIsHidden() in 
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/12890, and rationalized the naming in 
renaming IsOnlyForCLI() as IsHiddenForAPI(), so that IsHidden() == 
IsHiddenForCLI() && IsHiddenForAPI()

Subject: [gdal-dev] GetMetadataItem adds empty string to MetadataDomainList
Message-ID: <CADRrdKtJXbmMvhjVRxpFPPKpx6=OtaD3JFzQ6k2vbyZ4HxL3EA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am working in a branch to read the raw thermal data from DJI jpg images.
It is similar to FLIR, ... but different.
The branch is for now in an early stage of development. My problem is that
an existing tests are failing.

In this function I am checking the image is tagged as DJI in the EXIF:
https://github.com/jjimenezshaw/gdal/blob/dji-thermal/frmts/jpeg/jpgdataset.cpp#L405
    auto make = GetMetadataItem("EXIF_Make");
    bool bMakerDJI = make && STRCASECMP(make, "DJI") == 0;
    if (!bMakerDJI)
        return;

The problem is that the "GetMetadataItem" call is somehow writing another
entry in the GetMetadataDomainList, an empty string.

An then this test is failing:

https://github.com/jjimenezshaw/gdal/actions/runs/16811268016/job/47616930397#step:6:4277

47: E [
47: E 'IMAGE_STRUCTURE',
47: E + '',
47: E 'FLIR',
47: E 'SUBDATASETS',
47: E 'DERIVED_SUBDATASETS',
47: E ]

Is there a better way to get the EXIF "Make" tag, without polluting the
domain list? Or is there a hidden bug somewhere?

Thanks.

Thanks Even!

In the same branch there is a test that is failing: cppcheck_master
https://github.com/jjimenezshaw/gdal/actions/runs/16811268010/job/47616930470
I do not see anything related to my changes.
Is it a flaky test that I can ignore?

Thank you.

I've fixed those new warnings a few weeks ago. You'll just need to 
rebase on top of latest master

Subject: [gdal-dev] GeoJSON to CSV output difference between 3.7 and 3.9
Message-ID: <CAMQBGmWEp0EX+=NmWuxNmCOEAmFm0mnPGvar_a6P8cFqaPDTTw@mail.gmail.com>

I was attempting to upgrade a process from 3.7.0 to 3.9.1 with the below
input file, and I triggered one of my automated tests that checks the
output of ogr2ogr to CSV. In 3.7, it listed a LINESTRING, POINT,
MULTILINESTRING, and MULTIPOINT. But in 3.9, I only get the LINESTRING and
MULTILINESTRING. My arguments to ogr2ogr are:
-f CSV -overwrite "path/to/dest" "path/to/input.geojson" -lco
GEOMETRY=AS_WKT

Upon further staring at the input, I realized that the FeatureCollection
isn't exactly up to spec. The LineString and MultiLineString are indeed
features, but the point and multipoint are not. They're just the
"properties" and "geometry" propertes, no feature type. You can see this if
you throw the input contents in your favorite JSON formatter.

My questions are thus, is this just GDAL being more mindful of the GeoJSON
spec? Is there some sort of input option I can add that puts it back in the
less strict mode? Or should I just say okay it's different now and update
the test expectations / fix the input file to be proper features?

Peter,

I don't recall a conscious choice to change the behavior regarding the 
presence of "type":"Feature", but I would say the 3.7 behavior was more 
an accident than really intended (at least no regression test caught 
it). I can't think of a workaround but modifying the input file to be 
conformant with the GeoJSON spec.

Thanks for thinking on it! I've added the "type": "Feature" to the input
file and everything's happy again.

Subject: [gdal-dev] Could vector reproject be affected if alternative
 BLAS/LAPACK implementations are in use?
Message-ID: <CALRbqOSC98eAj-LNhZw2VJ4FL7a-cXSexBNpf7eqPttZEk=D4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Is it possible that vector reproject (via `GDALVectorTranslate()`)
could be affected if alternative BLAS/LAPACK implementations are
present (i.e, from Intel MKL or OpenBLAS)?

"ERROR 1: Reprojection failed" may originate from
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/e48cc4f31f43cf872c036d2c4e65e7368166c34a/apps/ogr2ogr_lib.cpp#L6378.
This is followed by seg fault.

The error is reported with GDAL 3.10.3, GEOS 3.13.0, PROJ 9.6.2 on
Fedora 42. The question is motivated by the issue at:
https://github.com/USDAForestService/gdalraster/issues/769.

The same code/inputs test without issue on a wide range of different
platforms in several CI and package management scenarios. The error
message and seg fault appear to only occur (sometimes not always) when
the alternative BLAS/LAPACK are present.

The code that generates the error is at:
https://github.com/USDAForestService/gdalraster/blob/d7c620b74a987cbc3f96dec245d37809e09f858a/src/gdal_exp.cpp#L1791

Input and output datasets are GPKG and reprojection is from NAD83 GCS
(EPSG:4269) to EPSG:32100.

Thanks.

Chris Toney

Chris,

BLAS/LAPACK is not a direct dependency of GDAL nor PROJ.? BLAS is a 
dependency of libarmadillo, which is an optional dependency of GDAL, but 
not involved in vector reprojection. I'd suggest :

- running ldd libgdal.so and check there are not 2 PROJ versions linked

- running under Valgrind to see if there is something interesting showing up

- running under gdb and showing the stack trace where it crashes

Hello PSC,

Several GDAL maintainers and PSC members have expressed interest in
attending the OSGeo Community Sprint to be held next month in Riga, Latvia
[1]. I would like to motion for the GDAL Sponsorship program to reimburse
travel expenses up to 1000? for Europeans and 1500? for non-Europeans

Hi Andrew,

The primary motivation for attending the sprint is to work side-by-side
with other GDAL developers and community members. From this perspective, I
would argue that paying for every maintainer and PSC member to attend the
same event would be money well spent. This is quite unlikely to occur but
if it did, the total cap would be 18 000? with the current composition of
the PSC and maintainers.

If all maintainers / members that have publicly or privately expressed
interest attend, the total cap would be 8500?. I expect most attendees will
be able to travel for less than the proposed caps.

Dan

Subject: [gdal-dev] VSIReadDirRecursive is O(n^2) with large nested
 hierarchies
Message-ID: <CAF1M8pcYuUEavzLgNtF_6opJsyVtEiNOxs5=EcQjt=SF+iJprw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks

I've stumbled across VSIReadDirRecursive being really slow when I give it a
ridiculously large ZIP file (containing 5 million files across ~1500
subdirectories)

I spent a while poking round the source code. It looks like
VSIArchiveFilesystemHandler::ReadDirEx() performs repeated linear scans
through the flat VSIArchiveContent::entries array during recursive
directory traversal. For each directory level, it scans all entries from
the beginning, resulting in O(n?) time complexity.

Performance degrades from ~1.3s for the first 5,000 files to ~6.7s for 5000
files once I get 100K files into a 5-million-file ZIP archive, and keeps
getting worse from there. I haven't managed to list the whole 5M-file
archive yet...

A couple of possible solutions:

1. Add a directory index to VSIArchiveContent (add a map of string
directory paths to index in the entries array) so we can jumpstart the
ReadDirEx implementation at the right place
2. make a VSIDIRArchive class (subclass of VSIDIR) and override
OpenDir/NextDirEntry, so that it doens't call ReadDirEx repeatedly but
instead just returns entries from the VSIArchiveContent::entries array.

I'm leaning towards (1) because it would presumably improve random lookups
by file path also (not just ReadDirRecursive). Is this something that would
be accepted as a PR?

Thanks

Subject: [gdal-dev] pipeline algorithm from C API
Message-ID: <CALRbqOSE+iSvUqJAasaWHCLLKLikHp_Ts4PU9R0aC+nTvaO0BA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
With the C API, pipeline algorithm can be instantiated, arguments
parsed, and the actual algorithm obtained and run. File output is
successfully generated.

I don't see a way in the C API to obtain the pipeline algorithm step
registry or access the step algorithms to obtain their argument
properties and values. Would GetStepAlg()  and related methods
potentially be exposed in the C API at some point, along with a
"GetStepRegistry"?

When run as described above, the main pipeline (actual) algorithm
object has an output arg of type DATASET, but it is not explicitly set
and has null value even though the file output is successfully
generated. I assume the dataset object is available in the output arg
of the "write" step algorithm, but I haven't followed that code
closely enough to understand some details. If that is correct though,
could the final output dataset be propagated up to the main pipeline
algorithm "output" arg?

Thanks.

That could be an option. Another already existing one is to use 
GDALAlgorithmGetUsageAsJSON() on the pipeline algorithm. You'll get the 
step algorithms and their arguments under the "pipeline_algorithms" key. 
Please file a ticket if you prefer the C API.

I suspect a mis-use of the API, because that definitely works as shown 
by the following Python snippet (which uses the C API)

 >>> from osgeo import gdal
 >>> alg = gdal.Run('raster pipeline', pipeline='read 
autotest/gcore/data/byte.tif ! write /vsimem/out.tif')
 >>> print(alg.Output().GetDescription())
/vsimem/out.tif

Maybe you run GDALAlgorithmFinalize() ? If so then the output dataset 
gets closed and the output dataset arg is nullified.

Hi Craig,

your option (1) sounds good to me. However, there is no requirement that 
all file entries in a directory are consecutive, so the raw entry list 
could potentially be

dirA/file1
dirB/file1
dirA/file2
dirB/file2

depending on how files are inserted in the ZIP. So you likely need to 
sort things before creating your index.

Thanks Even.

>That could be an option. Another already existing one is to use GDALAlgorithmGetUsageAsJSON() on the pipeline algorithm. You'll get the step algorithms and their arguments under the "pipeline_algorithms" key. Please file a ticket if you prefer the C API.

I'll work with the JSON string a bit first. Thanks for the hint.

>I suspect a mis-use of the API...

Sorry, I was writing to .gdalalg.json trying to replicate the example
at https://gdal.org/en/latest/programs/gdal_raster_pipeline.html#programs/gdal_raster_pipeline-2.
I was expecting it would write the file, and that in API use the
"output" dataset arg would also be opened on the GDALG, but that
probably doesn't make sense. It works fine when the final write step
is to .tif or .vrt. I should have explored that more first.

Ah ok, yes writing to the .gdalg.json file is a bit of special case. But 
you can just GDALOpen() the file afterwards to get the dataset

Subject: [gdal-dev] Problems generating a COG file
Message-ID: <CADRrdKuEu6RGPmf3zscdmOJFYj6L2_j6YrO-7qH3hRy_oh3PUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am warping a file to EPSG:3857 and later generating a COG with JPEG
compression.
The input tif file has also JPEG compression. (I learned that I need the -
dstalpha to keep it transparent)
I am doing it in Ubuntu 22.04 using conda.

First I tried this, using LZW as output of the warp

GDAL_CACHEMAX=16GB GDAL_NUM_THREADS=ALL_CPUS gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:3857 -ct
"+proj=pipeline +step +inv +proj=tmerc +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-2 +k=0.9996012717
+x_0=400000 +y_0=-100000 +ellps=airy +step +proj=push +v_3 +step +proj=cart

+proj=cart +ellps=WGS84 +step +proj=pop +v_3 +step +proj=webmerc +lat_0=0
+lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84" -co COMPRESS=LZW -co BIGTIFF=YES -co
TILED=YES -dstalpha orthomosaic.tiff web_mercator.tif

Creating output file that is 677881P x 303664L.
Processing orthomosaic.tiff [1/1] :
0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done in 00:27:04.


then I try to generate the COG
GDAL_CACHEMAX=16GB  GDAL_NUM_THREADS=ALL_CPUS gdal_translate
web_mercator.tif web_mercator_cog.tif -co COMPRESS=JPEG -co BIGTIFF=YES -of
COG
Input file size is 677881, 303664
0ERROR 1: LZWDecode:Not enough data at scanline 0 (short 40448 bytes)

time: 00:14:34

and failed

As it is an LZW problem, I tried with DEFLATE:

GDAL_CACHEMAX=16GB GDAL_NUM_THREADS=ALL_CPUS gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:3857 -ct
"+proj=pipeline +step +inv +proj=tmerc +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-2 +k=0.9996012717
+x_0=400000 +y_0=-100000 +ellps=airy +step +proj=push +v_3 +step +proj=cart
+ellps=airy +step +proj=helmert +x=446.448 +y=-125.157 +z=542.06 +rx=0.15
+ry=0.247 +rz=0.842 +s=-20.489 +convention=position_vector +step +inv
+proj=cart +ellps=WGS84 +step +proj=pop +v_3 +step +proj=webmerc +lat_0=0
+lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84" -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co BIGTIFF=YES
-co TILED=YES -dstalpha orthomosaic.tiff web_mercator_d.tif

Creating output file that is 677881P x 303664L.
Processing orthomosaic.tiff [1/1] :
0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done in 00:27:34.


And then the same
GDAL_CACHEMAX=16GB  GDAL_NUM_THREADS=ALL_CPUS gdal_translate
web_mercator_d.tif web_mercator_cog.tif -co COMPRESS=JPEG -co BIGTIFF=YES
-of COG
Input file size is 677881, 303664
0..                                                  - estimated remaining

0...10...                                            - estimated remaining
time: 00:42:12

and failed :(

Trying again I got this output at a similar point (but nothing about
ZIPDecode:Decoding
error at scanline 0).
corrupted double-linked list
Aborted (core dumped)

What can it be? Is there any workaround?
The file is big in pixels, but a big part is transparent.
web_mercator_d.tif is "only" 14GB

Thank you.

Javier,

- which GDAL version it is ?

- the "corrupted double-linked list" is definitely a proof of either a 
bug, or a mis-configuration. This is a message we see sometimes when 
GDAL accidentally links against 2 different libproj. Can you check "ldd 
/path/to/libgdal.so" to see if there is not 2 libproj appearing ?

- can you reproduce the issue with a fully blank file with the same 
characterists. For example try "gdal_create -if web_mercator.tif 
web_mercator_blank.tif -co SPARSE_OK=YES -co TILED=YES", and then run 
the gdal_translate to COG on that web_mercator_blank.tif

- does running in single threaded mode with GDAL_NUM_THREADS=1 make a 
difference regarding the error messages?

It says it takes 2 hours... but it was only 30 min
The final file was 1.8 GB

I started right after the first email a session without
defining  GDAL_NUM_THREADS. It said 12 hours... let's see tomorrow.
(after connecting to check) So far it goes to 40%, much more than before
that crashed about 13% (and only 3 hours left)


BTW, htop shows 16 cores and 64 GB of RAM.

Message-ID: <CAJbvKNp5aHpdjQaztNMv1hmCmNeQZwvRpk_0EaoVumXsZPOYuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I?m having trouble opening a RAR archive containing files with non-Latin
characters using GDAL:
$ docker run --rm -v `pwd`/arch.rar:/arch.rar:ro -e CPL_DEBUG=ON
ghcr.io/osgeo/gdal:ubuntu-full-3.11.3 gdalinfo "/vsirar/arch.rar"
VSIARCH: Opening arch.rar
VSIARCH: Pathname cannot be converted from UTF-16BE to current locale.
VSIARCH: Opening arch.rar
VSIARCH: Pathname cannot be converted from UTF-16BE to current locale.
ERROR 4: `/vsirar/arch.rar' does not exist in the file system, and is not
recognized as a supported dataset name.
gdalinfo failed - unable to open '/vsirar/arch.rar'.

It seems the issue is related to the non-Latin filenames in the archive.
Using unrar, I can extract the files and list them without any problem.
Is there any workaround to make GDAL handle such RAR archives correctly?

Thank you!

Denis,

| VSIARCH: Pathname cannot be converted from UTF-16BE to current locale.

This error message comes directly from "libarchive" that GDAL uses 
underneath for RAR support. You could check with that project. Maybe 
support for that encoding is missing, or there is some compilation 
option to enable support for it.

Hi,

Perhaps the key is in the message "to current locale." When I have seen something similar on Windows and when using my default code page 850, changing the code page into 65001 (UTF-8) has often helped. But I have never met  UTF-16BE data.

It was faster than expected. It is done in 2:44 hours.
The source file was the one compressed with LZW, so the LZWDecode message
is not in the data. It looks like something in the multithreading (that you
already guessed).
The output works in QGIS. 3.7 GB.

Can I do other useful tests tonight?

Maybe just check/confirm that the issue is multithreading on the 
decoding side (which it looks to be) with:

gdal_translate web_mercator.tif web_mercator_jpeg.tif -co COMPRESS=JPEG 
-co BIGTIFF=YES -of GTIFF -co TILED=YES -co BLOCKXSIZE=512 -co 
BLOCKYSIZE=512 -oo NUM_THREADS=ALL_CPUS

where web_mercator.tif is LZW or Deflate compressed

Right. it fails

But if I change -oo with -co, it fails somewhere else:

Hum, it would be useful if you could subset the input file to the 
minimum needed to reproduce the error and (possibly privately) share it 
to me.

Yeah, that makes sense. What?s interesting, though, is that the GDAL Python
bindings have no trouble retrieving the list of files inside the archive:

>>> from osgeo import gdal
>>> gdal.ReadDir("/vsirar/arch.rar")

Message-ID: <e1006e5d-7006-439a-9cfb-f3583b6161d4@gmail.com>

Hi,


I've a question with the python API of gdal 3.11 new programs and 
PostgreSQL driver.


I can run this in a terminal

gdal vector convert --overwrite base-cc-evol-struct-pop.csv 
PG:"dbname='insee' port=5432 host='localhost' user='thomas' 
password='xxxxxx' schemas='wip' tables='rp_population_import'"

 ?and everything is working fine.

But if I try from the python API with

gdal.Run("vector", "convert", format="PostgreSQL", overwrite=True, 
input="base-cc-evol-struct-pop.csv", output="dbname='insee' port=5432 
host='localhost' user='thomas' password='xxxxxxxx' schemas='wip' 
tables='rp_population_import'")

Python throw this error as if gdal/postgres actually try to create a new db:

ERROR 1: PostgreSQL driver doesn't currently support database creation.
Please create database with the `createdb' command.
ERROR 1: PostgreSQL driver failed to create dbname='insee' port=5432

Does anyone have a clue or it's me doing it bad ?

Thanks !

Thomas,

are you sure you really used --overwrite in the terminal and not 
--overwrite-layer ? The latter one is the one you want to use in this 
scenario of opening an existing datasource and overwriting its layer. 
And in python this will be overwrite_layer=True

Ok solved it.

What I was trying to do was simply to copy a csv into a Postgres 
database. (db and schema already existing, not the table)


The problem was (in terminal)

old way :

 ?ogr2ogr PG:"dbname='insee' port=5432 host='localhost' user='thomas' 
password='xxxxxxxx' schemas='wip'" test_file.csv

works


new way :

gdal vector convert test_file.csv PG:"dbname='insee' port=5432 
host='localhost' user='thomas' password='xxxxxxxx' schemas='wip'"

don't work, I need to add the --append option, even to create the table 
from scratch (but is that the intended way ?)


Another problem was that with the Python API, with the :

format=PostgreSQL option

it won't be enough, I still need to specify PG: before my connection 
string or gdal will search for a file or directory named as the 
connection string.


Thanks a lot !

--update would also work here (the error message has been updated in the 
3.12dev version to tell 'convert: Dataset 'PG:dbname=xxxxx' already 
exists. You may specify the --overwrite-layer/--append/--update option'

Yes the PG: prefix must always be used for PostgreSQL connection strings

Subject: [gdal-dev] How to compare closed curves with different start points?
Message-ID: <CANBY_ECNchUrckmBkvgEmeyBdiKd8-29TvYukxY2mvC_BkPOSg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In an application that I am currently developing there is a need to compare
geometries and I hit an obstacle when comparing OGRCurvePolygons.

>From a SQL/MM perspective I (mostly) need ST_OrderingEquals, meaning that
the coordinates must be in the same order. This is implemented by
OGRCurvePolygon as is stated in the documentation.

The obstacle however is that there are 3 freedoms when comparing polygons:
* the direction of a ring may differ
* the start point of a ring may differ
* the order of inner rings may differ

For example the following 2 curve polygons should be considered equal in
the application (apologies for the formatting):

CURVEPOLYGON (COMPOUNDCURVE (CIRCULARSTRING (85369.63 433446.48, 85368.99
433448.54, 85366.08 433449.62), (85366.08 433449.62, 85320.0 433442.34),

The differing directions of rings I can solve with
OGRCompoundCurve::isClockwise and OGRCompoundCurve::reversePoints to ensure
consistent ring directions before comparing.

The differing order of inner rings is solvable by finding matching rings.
This is O(N^2), but N is small enough in practice to be acceptable.

This leaves me with the problem of comparing rings that have different
start points. My first thought was to ask how to change the start point of
a closed curve (ring), since I cannot find anything about this in the
documentation. However that is not a solution, since you cannot change the
start point to any other point on the ring. For example changing the start
point to be the mid-point of an arc (circular string) would make the
geometry invalid.

I could iterate the points of the closed curve/ring, but I would also have
to know how each point is connected to the previous/next point (linear,
curve). I do not know if this information is available, searching the
documentation gave me no result.

So the question is: how can I compare closed curves (rings) that have
different start points?


Thank you for your help.

Hi,

I thought that PostGIS would return an empty geometry with ST_Difference, but it does not. I do not know what that means. Maybe PostGIS is linearizing the curve before computing the difference. Your geometry seems to be like a plate with rounded corners and two holes, and I guess that the ring of the rightmost hole is oriented differently.

 This was my query:

select st_difference(

Hi,In an application that I am currently developing there is a need to compare geometries and I hit an obstacle when comparing OGRCurvePolygons.From a SQL/MM perspective I (mostly) need ST_OrderingEquals, meaning that the coordinates must be in the same order.

Hi,

The geometry is indeed a plate with rounded corners and 2 circular holes,
it is an actual geometry in the port of Rotterdam though I have simplified
it somewhat.

The differences between the 2 geometries is that the exterior ring has
different start points and the right most inner ring has different start
points. The leftmost inner ring is identical between the two geometries. My
intention was to also include different ring directions, but I forgot to do
that.

Visualizing the st_difference query that you ran shows differences in the
right most ring. It is not the entire ring that is different, just parts of
it. I think this has to do with rounding and the fact that the curve
segments are actually different: the start point in the second geometry is
one point over, which means that the circular strings are entirely
different.

Compare this to the exterior ring: I choose a different start point, but I
did not actually change the curve segments. So the result is that all curve
segments are identical, but in a different order. This might explain why
st_difference detects the exterior rings as being identical. I wonder if
this changes when I make the direction of the exterior rings opposite of
each other.

Hi,
  One idea, perhaps too resource-intensive, would be to transform the linear rings into polygons, and then take the difference (OGRGeometry::Difference).
  If the difference gives a null area, then is no difference in input rings.

Hi,

The geometry is indeed a plate with rounded corners and 2 circular holes, it is an actual geometry in the port of Rotterdam though I have simplified it somewhat.

The differences between the 2 geometries is that the exterior ring has different start points and the right most inner ring has different start points. The leftmost inner ring is identical between the two geometries. My intention was to also include different ring directions, but I forgot to do that.

Visualizing the st_difference query that you ran shows differences in the right most ring. It is not the entire ring that is different, just parts of it. I think this has to do with rounding and the fact that the curve segments are actually different: the start point in the second geometry is one point over, which means that the circular strings are entirely different.

Compare this to the exterior ring: I choose a different start point, but I did not actually change the curve segments. So the result is that all curve segments are identical, but in a different order. This might explain why st_difference detects the exterior rings as being identical. I wonder if this changes when I make the direction of the exterior rings opposite of each other.

Hi,

I thought that PostGIS would return an empty geometry with ST_Difference, but it does not. I do not know what that means. Maybe PostGIS is linearizing the curve before computing the difference. Your geometry seems to be like a plate with rounded corners and two holes, and I guess that the ring of the rightmost hole is oriented differently.

Hi,

Unfortunately the rings of the polygon are not guaranteed to be linear
rings, so it must also work for rings that are compound curves or circular
strings.

I have considered stroking all arcs to make linear rings, but that
introduces extra points (that have not been surveyed) and I lose
information about the connection type between points.

Another option I am considering is breaking up a curve into a list of
segments with GDAL and then do some kind of matching on the lists. That
seems incredibly complex though, since the number of segments depends on
the start point of the curve: a start point at the beginning of a line
string part gives one segment, but a start point in the middle of a line
string gives two segments.
