Hi

I am working with Will on a wasm version of PROJ, trying to support also
remote grids (using emscripten_fetch).
Do you know if there a way to specify the location of proj.db as a remote
URL? in that case, it would not be embedded in the wasm file itself. (I am
not sure if it does make sense).

Cheers,
Javier.

Javier,

no that's currently not possible, although it would certainly be 
possible to plug the SQLite I/O layer onto the PROJ network layer. That 
said, that would use curl underneath, and I don't think curl is really 
an option in a WASM context.? I'm not totally sure of the interest of 
not having proj.db embedded in the wasm itself, if it needs to be 
remotely fetched then. And PROJ's use of the database, when computing 
coordinate operations to transform from a CRS to another one, often 
involves reading a significant amount of the DB, so that could involve 
lots of small network requests, which might be less efficient than full 
ingestion of the DB.

All,

I am travelling this week and won't be able to do the necessary grunt work for the next PROJ release scheduled for September 1st. I'm moving the release date to September 15th which should give me better time to prepare the release.

Sorry for the inconvienence.

/Kristian
