Hi

In case anybody needs it, I have made this python program to compute the
Helmert transformation given two sets of points in lat,lon,alt.

https://github.com/jjimenezshaw/helmert-calc

Such feature was suggested by Niklas to locate old data/maps in modern
systems, with coordinates in an "unknown" reference. That is what happens
with old/historical data ;)

Cheers,
Javier

PS of course it uses pyproj.
