Subject: [PROJ] The extent of EPSG:4326 is Douglas County, Wisconsin,
 according to proj.db
Message-ID: <CAMegOASaqg9bL6-DFWEWx0ArtBDZzmNcLO1YRv+F1dgDGBa4YQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm a little confused as to why the extent of EPSG:4326 is given as
Douglas County in Wisconsin, in proj.db

https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/blob/master/data/sql/extent.sql#L3305

INSERT INTO "extent" VALUES('EPSG','4326','USA - Wisconsin -
Douglas','United States (USA) - Wisconsin - Douglas
county.',46.15,46.76,-92.3,-91.55,0);

Best regards,

Will Temperley

It is from
https://epsg.org/extent_4326/USA-Wisconsin-Douglas.html

If there is a mistake in EPSG, you can connect them in their page.

Oh. I think I misunderstood.
That extent has the id 4326. But you want the extent of the crs EPSG:4326.
The numbers of different types can be repeated
In https://epsg.org/crs_4326/WGS-84.html
you can see that its extent has id 2830, that is
https://epsg.org/extent_2830/World-by-country.html

Subject: [PROJ] transformation for Greece
Message-ID: <CADRrdKt38xtsaDXaKYcj2NtHQuBRQ3u5HJKiQMMd9ubzM0-wig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying to make this transformation (that is not in EPGS). I do not
know how far I can go with PROJ.

(Apparently this transformation is needed to go from the coordinates used
by HEPOS.gr, the Greek positioning system, to the official -I think- CRS in
Greece, GGRS87.
The best is that the transformation would be in EPSG. Do you know anybody
in Greece with the proper contacts? I am happy to talk with them about it,
and help if needed)

Until it is in EPSG, I would like to use PROJ to do it.

The accurate transformation from ETRS89  to GGRS87 is something like:
- apply a Helmert transformation
- Project into a transverse Mercator
- Apply a correction grid. Yes, in the projected system.
- (optional) go back from the projected to the geographic crs.

I thought about several options:

- First option: create a WKT2 with a BOUNDCRS that defines the
transformation. Can it be done in a single WKT2?
- Second option: add the transformation to proj.db. Is it doable?
- Third option: Create "my own grid" file (in the geographic system)
combining all the steps. Of course, it will loose some accuracy due to the
new grid interpolation.

Any clue?
Thanks.

Javier,

you can probably hack around BOUNDCRS in a totally PROJ-specific way by 
using the "METHOD["PROJ-based operation method: {proj_pipeline_here}"

For example with the following file, 'projinfo -s @/tmp/tmp.wkt -t "WGS 
84"' will return the specified pipeline

BOUNDCRS[
 ??? SOURCECRS[
 ??????? GEOGCRS["unknown",
 ??????????? DATUM["Unknown based on GRS 1980 ellipsoid",
 ??????????????? ELLIPSOID["GRS 1980",6378137,298.257222101,
 ??????????????????? LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]]],
 ??????????? PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
 ??????????????? ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433],
 ??????????????? ID["EPSG",8901]],
 ??????????? CS[ellipsoidal,2],
 ??????????????? AXIS["longitude",east,
 ??????????????????? ORDER[1],
 ??????????????????? ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433,
 ??????????????????????? ID["EPSG",9122]]],
 ??????????????? AXIS["latitude",north,
 ??????????????????? ORDER[2],
 ??????????????????? ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433,
 ??????????????????????? ID["EPSG",9122]]]]],
 ??? TARGETCRS[
 ??????? GEOGCRS["WGS 84",
 ??????????? DATUM["World Geodetic System 1984",
 ??????????????? ELLIPSOID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,
 ??????????????????? LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]]],
 ??????????? PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
 ??????????????? ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
 ??????????? CS[ellipsoidal,2],
 ??????????????? AXIS["latitude",north,
 ??????????????????? ORDER[1],
 ??????????????????? ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
 ??????????????? AXIS["longitude",east,
 ??????????????????? ORDER[2],
 ??????????????????? ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
 ??????????? ID["EPSG",4326]]],
 ??? ABRIDGEDTRANSFORMATION["Transformation from unknown to WGS84",
 ??????? METHOD["PROJ-based operation method: +proj=pipeline +step 
+proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step 
+proj=helmert +x=1 +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=WGS84"]]]

Otherwise having records in the DB will certainly be cleaner. 
data/sql/transformations_czechia_extra.sql can probably be used as an 
example of quite advanced transformations, including using a grid 
referenced in a projected CRS.
