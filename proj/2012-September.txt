Subject: [Proj] [ANN] Pytroll workshop in late November
Message-ID: <505858F6.40002@smhi.se>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Dear all,

After the interest expressed earlier this year, we are glad to announce
that SMHI will host a pytroll workshop.

The pytroll project is a collaboration on weather satellite data
processing between DMI and SMHI. Its objective is provide different free
and open source python modules for the reading, interpretation, and
writing of weather satellite data. The provided python packages are
designed to be used both in R&D environments and in 24/7 operational
production. => http://www.pytroll.org

The datum of the workshop is fixed to week 48, that is the 26th to the
30th of November, and it will take place in Norrköping, Sweden at SMHI's
headquarters.

The proposed schedule would be as follows:
- - Monday: Introduction of pytroll and its different parts, demos
(including your demos if you have something to show!), installation of
pytroll on your computers.
- - Tuesday/Wednesday: work on setting up a customized production chain,
and/or dig directly into deeper subjects, depending on your needs/desires
- - Thursday/Friday: Going deeper into pytroll, with
contributions on underdeveloped parts like custom data readers,
enhancements to pyorbital, contribution to the metadata database and
messaging concepts.

As you can see, the schedule is designed so that the immersion will be
deeper as the time passes, this way you can choose exactly when you want
to arrive and leave.

We will most likely do pair programming when we start working on the
computers, so don't worry too much about your python skills, it'll be
fine

So we need some feedback on who plans on coming and for how long... It
would also be nice if you could tell us what your interests are in this
workshop, so that we can prepare a bit better.

Best regards,
Martin

Unless you are concerned at the centimeter level of precision, I would equate ITRF92 as being identical with WGS84.

In this post I tried to help - however, I don't know which towgs84 parameters
I should add to the GRASS's table of datums for ITRF92.

Any pointers?

Message-ID: <CAG3EsDTwR-aKck6KEhSw9HzCy8SxR1w90f3t7Yw7K2t+9UU4UA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm new to building proj and geotiff and am looking for some direction on
how to get proj to compile with geotiff

My current build is of proj 4.8.0 and I have built this following the build
instructions in the README file included in the windows.zip source
distribution  (nmake /f makefile.vc install-all)

My proj build completed without error and generated me a proj.dll,
proj.exe, proj.lib and proj_i.lib file as I expected it to.

I took the proj output and fed that into my geotiff 1.4.0 makefile.vc file
and set my PROJ_HOME, PROJ_INC and PROJ_LIB to the path where the
dependencies could be found.

However, when I go to compile GEOTIFF I end up with the following link
errors

geotiff_proj4.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol pj_free
referenced in function GTIFProj4FromLatLong
geotiff_proj4.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol pj_fwd
referenced in function GTIFProj4FromLatLong
geotiff_proj4.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol pj_init
referenced in function GTIFProj4FromLatLong
geotiff_proj4.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol pj_inv
referenced in function GTIFProj4ToLatLong
geotiff.dll : fatal error LNK1120: 4 unresolved externals
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio
10.0\VC\BIN\amd64\link.EXE"' : return code '0x460'
Stop.

Can someone let me know what I'm doing wrong here or if this is a problem,
are there any workarounds?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <A6B354EE18E5844AB1B088E989BA2E6002A253DE@mail.terragotech.com>

Hi, all,

I'm trying to track down an issue I'm seeing with Azimuthal Equidistant
values when compared to ESRI.  The ESRI coordinate system I'm using is
World Azimuthal Equidistant.  I'm using some sample data that is in the
Tucson AZ area.

 

The coordinate strings we're passing into PROJ to set up the transform
are:

Src: +proj=aeqd +lat_0=0 +lon_0=0  +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m
+no_defs

Dest: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs

 

I pass in the following coordinates (Easting,Northing):

1.        -9939304, 6673447

2.       -9930938, 6684888

 

I get this result:

1.        -69d 0' 0.12", 32d 15' 14.159"

2.       -68d 59' 24.215", 32d 19' 5.934"

Needless to say, this isn't anywhere near Tucson, and is about 31-32
degrees off longitudinally.

 

When I try using a sphere (I've tried both semi major axis and
equal-area), the values are much closer, but still off.  

Src: +proj=aeqd +lat_0=0 +lon_0=0  +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6378137.0
+b=6378137.0 +units=m +no_defs

Dest: +proj=longlat +a=6378137.0 +b=6378137.0 +no_defs

 

1.        -110d 50' 50.416", 32d 6' 24.361"

2.       -110d 51' 24.032", 32d 10' 15.985"

 

Src: +proj=aeqd +lat_0=0 +lon_0=0  +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6371007.1809
+b=6371007.1809 +units=m +no_defs

Dest: +proj=longlat +a=6371007.1809 +b=6371007.1809 +no_defs

 

1.        -110d 59' 11.622", 32d 4' 58.135"

2.       -110d 59' 45.523", 32d' 8' 49.575"

 

Does anyone out there have any idea why this is happening?  I'm at my
wits end to explain it.

 

Thanks

 

Joe White

Hello Joseph. 

I haven't found any documentation of how Proj.4 computes aeqd on an ellipsoid.
But the source code is clearly from John P. Snyder, Map Projections: A Working Manual.
http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395

(For examle, the assignment 

 c = P->N1 * s * (1. + s * s * (- H2 * ...

 is Equation (25-25) on page 199 of Snyder.)

So Snyder's warnings about the formulas are relevant:

   "These are considered suitable for lines up to 800 km in length."

Because they are intended for local use in Micronesia, not global use. 
But your test points are about 12000 km from the central point, so it seems
that the ellipsoid formulas for aeqd in Proj.4 don't work that far away. 

Disclaimer: I have a fairly old version of Proj.4 on my home computer, but I don't think the aeqd code has been changed recently. 

Best regards,

Mikael Rittri

Reply:

Your values seem quite normal.
The values for the spherical azimuthal equidistant projection are 
mathematically correct.
Are they really that far off?
The geonames.org server gives for Tucson Arizona the coordinates N 32° 13' 
18'', W 110° 55' 35''
You cannot use the ellipsoidal azimuthal equidistant projection (in PROJ) 
for distances greater than about 800 km from (lat0,lon0) or about 7.5 
degrees.
Most ellipsoidal azeq projections are approximations, developed for areas 
like Micronesia or Guam.
