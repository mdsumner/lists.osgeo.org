Subject: [PROJ] Sinusoidal interrupted
Message-ID: <CADRrdKtX9PQjHWbjGB=QyzrUGT1ACPDrFaBL1trooFjGp=T5Lw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I was looking for the Sinusoidal interrupted projection in PROJ (and later
QGIS)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusoidal_projection#/media/File:Usgs_map_sinousidal_equal_area.PNG
But I haven't found it. Am I wrong?

What I found is https://proj.org/en/stable/operations/projections/sinu.html,
that is not interrupted.

In case it is not there, would it be worth it to add it? See that this is
one type of projection used to print the covering of a 3D globe.

Cheers
Javier.

 I would not recommend sinusoidal for use as globe gores. The mechanical properties of the print medium and the count of the segments factor into the problem, but overall, sinusoidal is unlikely to result in seamless gores. Mathematically, it will result in overlaps along the edges, and the straight segments of the parallels will cause kinks at the segment edges.

Hi PROJ community

Geoid 2024 has been in operation at GSI in Japan since 4/1/2025.
?https://www.gsi.go.jp/buturisokuchi/grageo_geoidmodeling.html?

Currently, the PROJ library only has Geoid 2011, but does anyone know when it will be updated to Geoid 2024?

Please, replay if you know. 

Sincerely,
Masashi

Hi Masashi

I started that process. Quite surprising that they released it on April
1st, being the official model since April 1st.
I got the grid files (yes, in plural) via a colleague in Japan. But you
need an account to log in. That made me think if the data is "open source
enough".
I also got a permission from the GSI (a copy of what we got for GSIGEO2011)
for JPGEO2024.
They released 3 files: a global geoid model, a grid file with the offsets
per island (with 0.0 in the main islands referring to Tokyo bay level), and
the combination of the two. I have not clear what the GSI plans to do in
the future. The area of use of the vertical system is covering only the
main islands (this is not new).
I would love that they publish the vertical transformations in EPSG, so we
all have it clear.

So in summary:
 - PROJ PSC, should we include the geoid model JPGEO2024 if the file is not
publicly available without an account? (I already have the file an the
authorization)
 - Masashi (or anybody else), do you have any contact in GSI to ask if they
can add the vertical transformations for the vertical system? The more
people ask for it, the more they realize that it is useful.

Cheers
Javier

Hi Masashi-san,

There is an existing GitHub issue regarding that, maybe you can comment 
inside the issue and help move that forward there: 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-data/issues/36

thanks,

Indeed. That minimizes maintenance on our side if the grid is referenced 
by a transformation available in EPSG.

If the file can be released under an open data license, the fact that 
you had to create an account to get it initially doesn't matter.

Hello again,

I looked in your questions and have responded to them.

Regarding the inclusion of the JPGEO2024 geoid model:
The data from JPGEO2024 published by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) (such as ISG and XML) should not be included.
However, data converted to GTX or TIF formats can be made public by applying for the use of survey results.
 (Since you already have permission, I think the application is unnecessary.)


About including vertical transformations in EPSG:
In regard to your question, I have also made inquiries to GSI about this topic. 
Unfortunately, there is still uncertainty when this will be available, but I'll let you know when I get a response from GSI.

I hope this answers your questions! Let me know if you need anything else.

-Masashi

Message-ID: <YT4PR01MB9925C12E9CCB6343A2572FFED1B42@YT4PR01MB9925.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi All,

I've been struggling with trying to set proj to use ca_nrc_ON27CSv1.tif grid as the default transformation when transforming between UTM NAD83 CSRS (epsg:2958) and UTM NAD83 (epsgL26917) Original.

In the past I've specified the +nadgrids=./ON83CSv1.gsb in the cs2cs command but was hoping that I could just set the default value in the proj.db to apply the gridshift.

Is this possible?  I've run the projsync to pull the new version of the grid but still no luck.

Regards

Travis,

in EPSG, the grid ON83CSv1 is registered for the transformation between 
NAD83 original and NAD83(CSRS) v3. Note the v3 suffix. So instead of UTM 
NAD83 CSRS (epsg:2958) you need to use "NAD83(CSRS)v3 / UTM zone 17N" 
(epsg:22317)

$ projinfo -s EPSG:22317 -t EPSG:26917 --spatial-test intersects -o PROJ 
--single-line -q
+proj=pipeline +step +inv +proj=utm +zone=17 +ellps=GRS80 +step +inv 
+proj=hgridshift +grids=ca_nrc_ON83CSv1.tif +step +proj=utm +zone=17
