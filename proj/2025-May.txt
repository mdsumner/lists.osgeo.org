Subject: [PROJ] building qgis 3.34.15 fails with proj 9.6.0,
 it seems (fuzzy for now)
Message-ID: <rmimsbv27yc.fsf@s1.lexort.com>

Note that it's possible my pkgsrc package for 9.6.0 is troubled, and
it's possible I'm confused.

I build the whole osgeo stack under pkgsrc, and mostly that's ok.  I
recently updated proj from 9.5.1 to 9.6.0, and I have locally updated
(not published) gdal 3.11.0beta1.

Right now I am using 3.34.15.  (Yes, I know that's old LTR.)>

I then rebuilt a lot of packages (because of python setuptools), and
qgis failed, with crssync complaining about inserts and constraints.

I then reverted proj from 9.6.0 to 9.5.1, without updating anything that
depends on it, because in theory there is no ABI break.  Then I built
qgis again and got a clean build.

I had also built but not installed Javier's NATRF2022 package.
PROJ_AUX_DB is not set in my qgis build env, so I don't see how the qgis
build could be affected.

Thus, it looks like the db I end up with from 9.6.0 has dups, but that's
jumping to conclusions.

I'll revisit this and get a proper build log, and see if I can figure
out what's up, and post again.

In the meantime, if you have installed proj 9.6.0 (and maybe gdal 3.11
beta) on your system, I would be interested to know if building qgis
succeeds or not.

Subject: [PROJ] geoid model for GNTRANS2016 height
Message-ID: <CADRrdKsgUrRHqDGXgpkgJZ2dOiAfQorN8q0vPCKyL=e0YthE0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I found this vertical system:
https://epsg.org/crs_9927/GNTRANS2016-height.html

That has a geoid model definition. But the transformation used is not "...
to GNTRANS2016 height" but to "... to DHDN2016 height". Why? I do not know.
Probably they are considered equivalent for Deutsche Bahn (yes, the railway
company).

Looking at the table "epsg_definingoperation" from the EPSG database there
is [lines are from a generated db, not the original sql]
INSERT INTO "main"."epsg_definingoperation" ("crs_code", "ct_code") VALUES
('9927', '9925');

There is a similar one for "Alicante height", that works normally
INSERT INTO "main"."epsg_definingoperation" ("crs_code", "ct_code") VALUES
('5782', '9410');

And there is no entry for "DHDN2016 height" (7837) in that table. But there
are transformations defined. Yes, the German vertical system and geoid
model works.

I do not know what does it exactly mean that "defining operation". I was
expecting something like "the orthometric height is *defined* as the
ellipsoidal height minus that geoid undulation"  (so that geoid file is not
a "model", but a "definition") as they do in the new American NAPGD2022.
"By definition". But I have not seen it before. (In Alicante height I am
very surprised, because the vertical system is really old).

Anyhow, I think there is a missing connection in the proj.db between
"GNTRANS2016 height" and the geoid model transformation defined in EPSG. I
have the impression we are not using epsg_definingoperation at all.

Does it make sense to process it? Is "GNTRANS2016 height" the only one
without the connection?

Cheers,
Javier.

Javier,

The epsg_definingoperation table of EPSG captures (among other defining 
operations) the HeightTransformation association of a VerticalCRS of OGC 
Abstract Topic 2 (https://docs.ogc.org/as/18-005r4/18-005r4.html), and 
the GEOIDMODEL[] node in WKT.

IMHO, this concept of "defining operation" is a unnecessary modelling 
complication. If there was *one* single defining operation allowed, I 
could perhaps understand it, but several ones are allowed (e.g. NAVD88 
is "defined" by all the US geoid models! see 
https://epsg.org/crs_5703/NAVD88-height.html), and I bet that if you try 
those different ones, they don't lead to the same value of NAVD88 
height.. So, I believe this is effectively redundant with the coordinate 
operation table.

The PROJ EPSG db importer doesn't import that epsg_definingoperation 
table and solely relies on the epsg_coordoperation table to figure out 
which transformation are available.

It seems to be that for this GNTRANS2016 height, this is more a hole in 
the EPSG db to not have a corresponding entry in epsg_coordoperation, 
unless they have a good reason for not doing that. Before implementing 
complications on our side to process epsg_definingoperation, I'd suggest 
you contact IOGP to check.

The unique constraints insert failure issue was not the problem.  That
happens with both 9.5.1 and 9.6.0.

The changed line in the build output is

  Operation needs translation in QgsCoordinateReferenceSystemUtils::translateProjection: spilhaus

which is because

  QString QgsCoordinateReferenceSystemUtils::translateProjection( const QString &projection )

lacks a pair of lines that look like this

  if ( projection == QLatin1String( "gstmerc" ) )
    return QObject::tr( "Gauss-Schreiber" );

for spilhaus.


These lines are present in git on release-3_40 and master.


All in all, it was a surprise to me, and perhaps it is to some of you,
that adding a projection in proj leads to a requirement to add code to
qgis.

I already asked IOGP.

I made a query to their db (maybe a bit older version, not the last) and
got that this is the only case not covered properly:

select edo.*, ecrs.coord_ref_sys_name, eco.coord_op_code,
eco.coord_op_name, eco.source_crs_code, eco.target_crs_code,
coord_op_accuracy

on edo.crs_code = ecrs.coord_ref_sys_code
left OUTER JOIN epsg_coordoperation AS eco
on edo.ct_code = eco.coord_op_code
where edo.crs_code not in (eco.target_crs_code, eco.source_crs_code) AND
eco.coord_op_name NOT like '%' || ecrs.coord_ref_sys_name || '%'

Message-ID: <CADRrdKsT9tX8+M5Ni7ePU5NHWu01a5mNEJaYYJB3fCL2FVADOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

This is a question to understand what should be more correct, not a request
to change anything in PROJ. The numerical difference is very small.

The 3D transformation from EPSG:4258 to EPSG:4150+5729 has two components:
a grid file for the geoid model of LHN95 height, interpolated in ETRS89,
and the Helmert transformation from ETRS89 (EPSG:4258) to CH1903+
(EPSG:4150).
The input of the Helmert transformation should be ellipsoidal heights, but
in this pipeline they are orthometric heights. Right?
Technically that would change also the horizontal output because of the
change in elevation in the input of the Helmert (again, the difference is
very small. 1 or 2 mm. I just want to understand it).

PROJ_NETWORK=ON projinfo EPSG:4258 EPSG:4150+5729 -o proj --3d

+proj=pipeline
  +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1
  +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad
  +step +inv +proj=vgridshift +grids=ch_swisstopo_chgeo2004_ETRS89_LHN95.tif
        +multiplier=1
  +step +proj=push +v_3
  +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80
  +step +inv +proj=helmert +x=674.374 +y=15.056 +z=405.346

  +step +proj=pop +v_3
  +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg
  +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1


Would this be more correct? (undoing the vgridshift before calling Helmert,
but after "push +v_3")

+proj=pipeline
  +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1
  +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad
  +step +inv +proj=vgridshift +grids=ch_swisstopo_chgeo2004_ETRS89_LHN95.tif
        +multiplier=1
  +step +proj=push +v_3
  +step +proj=vgridshift +grids=ch_swisstopo_chgeo2004_ETRS89_LHN95.tif
        +multiplier=1
  +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80
  +step +inv +proj=helmert +x=674.374 +y=15.056 +z=405.346

  +step +proj=pop +v_3
  +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg
  +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

Thanks.

Javier.

PS to get output in meters use EPSG:2056, that uses the Swiss projection. I
removed it to simplify the pipelines.
Just replace the last two lines of the pipeline with
+step +proj=somerc +lat_0=46.9524055555556 +lon_0=7.43958333333333 +k_0=1

Hi Javier,

yes, your analysis is fully correct , and your enhanced pipeline too. 
However that would suck a bit to have to implement it like that as doing 
and undoing the vgridshift is inefficient. The ideal solution would use 
some storage space as we discussed a few months ago but couldn't reach a 
conclusion how to implement that.? For 3D operations only like that, we 
could use the v_4 component as the temporary storage using push +v_3 / 
axisswap order=3,4 / pop +v_3 trickery

These are CRSes I know ~nothing about so I went to read.  Things I think
I understood:

  EPSG:4258 and EPSG:4150 both seem to be 2D, not 3D.

  CH1903+ is a higher-accuracy realization of CH1903, intending to keep
  coordinates stable.

  I can't quite follow if CH1903+ is, strictly, a reference frame, and
  if it is the same as LV95, or if they are two realizations of the same
  system, but I think effectively they are interchangeable.  I would
  expect that CH1903 is truly a 2D datum, and maybe CH1903+ is 3D with
  HAE.

  LN02 (1902) is an orthometric datum based on leveling.

  LHN95 is sort of leveled and sort of geoid model, in a way I don't
  understand.

  Given that LHN95 goes with LV95/CH1903+, I find it strange that the
  grid file is expressed in ETRS89.  This would then use ETRS89
  horizontal for lookups, and give the difference between ETRS89 HAE and
  LHN95, intending to model LN02.

I see your point that converting to orthometric and using LLH in a
helmert transform is incorrect, and that you'd expect horizontal errors
to be small.  Vertically, it's taking heights in LHN95 and then applying
the HAE difference from ETRS89 to CH1903+, and that seems wrong, as I'd
assume that the HAE of a point in ETRS89 and CH1903+ are different.



What I think you want is to get a grid file that is indexed in CH1903+
and that gives the difference from CH1903+ HAE to LHN95 height (or
defines LHN95, giving an estimate from CH1903+ HAE to LN02).   I don't
understand why that isn't what's available.   In the US, GEOID18 gives
the difference in NAD83(2011) HAE to NAVD88, and those are more or less
analogous.


If you can't get that, I think you have to get the LHN95-h from the
model, and then transform the LLh to CH1903+ LLh, and then add LHN95-h,
and add h-ETRS89 - h_CH1903+ (or maybe subtract...).

Probably that isn't available because the usual way to combine a geoid model and a Helmert transformation is to base them both on a international/regional CRS (e.g. ETRS89). I think that this problem should be fixed in the PROJ code, not by asking national authorities to make redundant geoid models.

I'm working for the national authority of the Netherlands (NSGI). We find using the v_4 component as the temporary storage too confusing, when also publishing time-dependent transformations. Therefore, we publish a pipeline with the inefficient doing and undoing the vgridshift. However, I'm still hoping for a conclusion for the discussion of a few months ago on how to implement the ideal solution.

In the US (what I've mostly paid attention to) we have a regional datum
but more or less no local datums, or really that the older datums aren't
in use much (NAD27/NGVD29).  At least I am not aware of geoid models for
NGVD29.  I'm viewing NAD83(2011/CSRS-recent) and ETRS89 as occupying
similar logical positions.

I am having trouble understanding, so a brief question if you're
willing.

  I think we're talking about
   ch_swisstopo_chgeo2004_ETRS89_LHN95.tif
  which is the same data aas
   https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/geoidmodell-chgeo2004-in-etrs89
  which says
    Swiss geoid model in the version of 2004 (CHGeo2004) in the reference
    system ETRS89. It forms the zero reference surface (approximated mean
    sea level) for height determination and serves for the transformation
    between ellipsoidal heights and orthometric heights (LHN95). The geoid
    heights are stored in a regular 30 x 30 seconds grid and are
    interpolated by the biquadratic method. The model is available in
    various reference systems and data formats.

  The swisstopo grid shift file is indexed horizontally in ETRS89.
  That's easy to understand.

  The values are expressed in ETRS89 HAE, and are the ellipsoidal
  heights of the LHN95 zero surface.

So, if you want to start in ETRS89, and end up with horizontal in
CH1903+, and vertical in LHN95, you have to:

  A) Use the geoid model to get LHN95 height from the ETRS89 HAE, based on
  ETRS89 horizontal.

  B) Take the original ETRS89 LLh and Helmert transform to CH1903+, and
  then discard the h, and swap in the LHN95 H from step A.

And I think that

  C) Take ETRS89 LLh, and apply the geoid model to get LLH in
  ETRS89+LHN95, and then Helmert transform that LLH as if it were ETRS89
  LLh to get CH1903+, and treat it as CH1903+ + LHN95, then you'll end
  up with an introduced error which is the difference in ETRS89 and
  CH1903+ ellipsoid heights.

What I'm having trouble with is that for a station, I expect ETRS89 HAE
and CH1903+ HAE to be different, and that therefore one has to do the
A/B procedure above.   I don't understand how that relates to "Undoing"
the grid shift.  Perhaps these are two ways of expressing the same thing
and that's what the push/pop is all about.


I can certainly see your point that proj should work well with the grid
files as published.

Subject: [PROJ] 9.6.0 sharp embed compiler test on gcc7
Message-ID: <rmiy0vdyi4z.fsf@s1.lexort.com>

I updated proj to 9.6.0 and on NetBSD 10 with gcc 10 it seems fine.
The build fails on NetBSD 9 with gcc 7, I think due to gcc 7 not
supporting C23 (which is spelled --std=c2x in gcc10).

http://www.ki.nu/pkgsrc/reports/current/NetBSD-9.0/20250429.1321/proj-9.6.0/configure.log

The issue is not old cmake; I have 3.31.7 which is >> 3.21.


As I read CMakeLists.txt:

  function (is_sharp_embed_available res)
      if (CMAKE_VERSION VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL 3.21 AND
          ((CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "GNU") OR (CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "Clang")))
          # CMAKE_C_STANDARD=23 only supported since CMake 3.21
          set(TEST_SHARP_EMBED
            "static const unsigned char embedded[] = {\n#embed __FILE__\n};\nint main() { (void)embedded; return 0;}"
          )
          set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD_BACKUP "${CMAKE_C_STANDARD}")
          set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD "23")
          check_c_source_compiles("${TEST_SHARP_EMBED}" _TEST_SHARP_EMBED)
          set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD "${CMAKE_C_STANDARD_BACKUP}")
          if (_TEST_SHARP_EMBED)
              set(${res} ON PARENT_SCOPE)
          else()
              set(${res} OFF PARENT_SCOPE)
          endif()
      else()
          set(${res} OFF PARENT_SCOPE)
      endif()
  endfunction()

I think the intent is to try to enable C23 and then try to build, and if
that succeeds, turn on sharp embedding.   But I think what's happening
is that cmake is erroring out trying to enable c23 instead of just
having the build fail.

I also don't understand how C23 is handled if sharp embedding is turned
on.  It would seem one has to end up passing --std for it, because a
compiler that can compile C23 does not necessarily default to it.

Does this work for others on compilers that don't support C23?

Thanks, am cherry-picking that into pkgsrc.  With gcc 10 the build diff
is that the following lines vanish, changing a failing embed test into
"not trying because gcc10 < gcc15".

  -- Performing Test _TEST_SHARP_EMBED
  -- Performing Test _TEST_SHARP_EMBED - Failed

With NetBSD 9 and gcc 7, it also successfully built.
Tests pass except for spilhaus, which I realize is new and I'll look
into that - surely not relatd to C23/embed.

Ah, did not guess that from the original cmake code, but makes sense.

It worked with 7 which is my current take on "oldest gcc that is not
unreasonably ancient" but idk what's up with older RHEL and older ubuntu
that people run, these days.

This is indeed the correct method, but this is not really possible with a single pipeline in PROJ. If two pipelines is not an option, one workaround is temporarily storing the height in the epoch field v_4. I don't like that, because we will publish a time-dependent transformation too.

 > I don't understand how that relates to "Undoing" the grid shift. Perhaps these are two ways of expressing the same thing and that's what the push/pop is all about.

This is another workaround, that we use. From global/regional to national/local datum (from bottom to top in the pipeline below): first apply the geoid model; save the height; undo the geoid model; apply the Helmert transformation; restore the saved height.

I hope this clarifies what is meant with undoing the vgridshift,

Thanks.   It's nice to have confirmation that my understanding is ok.

Yes.  It seems to be exactly a way to merge the grid-derived vertical
with the local LLh from Helmert from regional LLh.  I was just confused
by undo.


I guess we need a way to express things like "do this pipeline and take
these components, and then this other pipeline and take these otehr
components" more cleanly.

Thanks for taking the time to explain things.
