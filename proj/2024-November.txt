This mail is mostly directed at PSC members.

For the coming FOSS4G we've been asked to present a yearly project status.
I've prepared a slide with some basic information in the slide deck for the
AGM [0].
I'm sure I've forgotten to include something, so please feel free to add
more to the slide if you feel something is missing.

Unfortunately I won't be able to attend the conference myself so if someone
from the PSC will attend the conference it would be much appreciated if you
can present the PROJ project status.

Current situation in PROJ and GDAL webpages:
---------------------
PROJ

---------------------

I have the impression (maybe I misunderstood) that both the automatic
redirection and the robots should be pointing to "stable". (GDAL
didn't have "stable" url at the beginning, I know)

That will make search engine indexers don't have to remake the index,
with the consequent degradation in the position. Also will not point
somebody to an old version of the software. It is good that the old
versions are there in case you need it, but search engines should
point to "stable" (and IMHO not to latest, with functionalities that
are may not be released yet).

What do you think?

There was a problem in PROJ after the last release. Maybe we can fix
it to be ready for the next release in a couple of weeks.

BTW, should I send this email also to GDAL mailing list?

Cheers,

Javier

The annoying thing with "stable" is that it points to the latest 
released *tag*, not the head of the release branch, so bugfixes in the 
doc after the release don't appear until the next one.

Refresh our minds about which problem you're thinking too (don't we 
spend our time solving problems) :-) ?

One problem I've in mind with the "stable" RTD tag is that when you 
prepare the release, you need in advance to update the doc to advertize 
the release *before* creating the tag. For example 
https://proj.org/en/stable/download.html doesn't point to the 9.5.0 
release, because the commit that advertizes it was done just after. For 
GDAL, I've adjusted the release procedure so that step is done in advance.

Bottom line: I would be in favor of pointing to "stable" if we could 
tweak the RTD configuration to point to a branch of our choice, but I 
don't think that's currently possible.

Another thought: the GDAL user survey currently advertized on gdal.org 
couldn't be advertized if the default was the stable RTD tag

EDIT: actually looking at 
https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/versions.html, I do read "If you 
want a custom |stable| version, create either a tag or branch in your 
project with that name.". So maybe we should just create a git "stable" 
branch, but that means we need to regularly resync it to the actual HEAD 
of the active 9.x git branch

Looks like you found the proper and nice way to do it, right? Using a tag
(or branch) called "stable". I think that the overhead of the release
process is minimal. In PROJ it would replace the penultimate line from
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/blob/master/HOWTO-RELEASE.md if I understood
correctly.

Do not forget about robots.txt allowing only stable. I think it would make
the indexing more stable (no pun intended initially. Now yes ;), and the
user experience better (finding always "stable", and not an old branch)

That's not so simple. There is no concept of automatic aliasing a git 
banch to another one. You can resync between them at will, but that must 
be done each time. So we'd likely need a tiny script doing something like:

git checkout stable
git fetch origin 9.5
git merge origin/9.5? # should be a forward merge (ie not merge commit)
git push origin stable

and running it regularly (at least each time a commit in 9.5 affects the 
doc)

and when releasing a new 9.6 version, at release time, recreating the 
stable branch it with

git checkout stable
git fetch origin 9.6
git reset --hard origin/9.6
git push -f origin stable

Wouldn't it be easier with a "tag" ? Just set (or re-set with -f) the tag
"stable" to the needed commit (that can be another tag, like "9.5.1")

After every change in doc? I would expect that stable is the last released
version. If there is anything changed in the doc, it will be in the next
release (or when we consider it important like the GDAL survey)

Yes tagging the new commit in 9.5 as "stable" would be slightly quicker. 
But that *can't* be labelled as 9.5.1, because we issue such SemVer tags 
to match official releases (with a tarball etc).

I've finally successfully experimented some automation with a workflow 
that automatically refreshes the tag when a push is done in the 9.5 
branch. See https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/4323 and 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/4324. This adds 2 extra steps when 
creating a new maintenance branch, but apart from that, that should be 
transparent afterwards.

Indeed, no, mention removed in 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/4324/commits/bb24e728cce9cbcce165808b95d41e671d1a045c

And one-time configuration changed added in 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/4323#issuecomment-2480678212

Thank you Even for the changes done!

Somehow related are the robots.txt.

How are they managed in RTD?

In GDAL there "was" something (for latest, not for stable)
https://web.archive.org/web/20241027091118/https://gdal.org/robots.txt
but gone on Nov 1st
https://web.archive.org/web/20241101132800/https://gdal.org/robots.txt

I do not find anything related in the code of GDAL. Is it managed
internally in RTD settings? (I don't have access to that)

I would suggest to have something like this:

User-agent: *
Allow: /en/stable/
Disallow: /en/
Sitemap: https://proj.org/sitemap.xml


Cheers

Should be fixed per 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/commit/7fd0162a9b3ec3032d943390f6d4fd6aeab5bf6b 
(based on hint at 
https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/robots.html#tool-integration)

... BUT ... unfortunately, there seems to be issues on RTD side that I 
don't know how to solve. With the 'stable' tag, it has only seen the 
(now dangling) initial commit of that tag, and not the further updates. 
I've just tried to create instead a 'stable' branch, and this is a bit 
similar in that the build of it in 
https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/osgeo-proj/builds/26313882/ sees as 
'stable' the state of the '9.5' branch at time it was created in 
september 
(https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/commit/0a407325fbb5bf42407a7dc5d4f948be9707e302) 
and not the actual state of the github repo 
(https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/tree/stable) . But if you look at the 
history of 
https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/osgeo-proj/builds/?version__slug=stable 
, you can see that at some point it tried to build commit 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/commit/34cfbeb650529e153059880f34ce01dd73d9b5cf 
( the actual 'stable' github branch), but that was when I temporarily 
swtiched back the active version to the 9.5 branch instead of stable. So 
it seems the state of stable in RTD is only updated to its latest github 
state when it is *not* the default version. Or something like that...? 
Seems like a bug. It looks a bit like this is similar to 
https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/11768 . I've no 
more idea on how to solve that. I've s/spend quite a bunch/burnt too 
much/ time on this... Want to take the stick on ... ?

... actually ... disregard my below BUT.? The latest RTD build of 
'latest' 
(https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/osgeo-proj/builds/26314172/) 
actually caught up with the state of the 'latest' github branch ( 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/commit/8df3845d1896dd21e9270d99ecae31703fe79c4b 
== https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/commits/stable/?? at time of writing ).

That said, there's a RTD UI glitch which was the reason of my confusion. 
If you go to https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/osgeo-proj/builds/ , 
and put your mouse over the "[icon] stable [green tick]" button towards 
the right of the "Version stable" line, a popup window appears with a 
"Branch" link whose label is 'stable' but it resolves to 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/tree/9.5.0/)

And now:

$ curl https://proj.org/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Allow: /en/stable/
Disallow: /en/
Sitemap: https://proj.org/sitemap.xml

So things seem to work fine ... for now ... To monitor that this remains 
... stable

Kristian,

This is a side effect of the logic to get faster database builds, which 
is affected when the version number is changed. So indeed 
data/CMakeLists.txt must be adjusted with the provided value

I've also submitted https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/4330 to add the 
needed step in the release procedure.

the good news is that on NetBSD 10 amd64, I get the same error as Bas,
implying that all the previous build steps ran ok.

I think we are awaiting RC2.  If that's confused on my part, please let
me know what I should be doing.

Builds like a charm, passes its test as well as GDAL autotest suite.

Indeed we are. Good catch. I?ll update the NEWS and include it in the final release.

PSC Members,

No problems (apart from a NEWS-detail) has been reported with PROJ
9.5.1.RC2. The same is true for PROJ-data 1.20RC1,
so I motion that they be promoted to final releases.

I'll start with my +1.

/Kristian
