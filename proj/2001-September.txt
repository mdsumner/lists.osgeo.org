Jere,

The problem is that PROJ is compiled with the default C library (LIBC) and
your application is presumably built with the debug C runtime DLL (MSVCRTD).
I would suggesting linking against the PROJ stub library (for the DLL)
instead of the static library.  The stub library should be proj_i.lib.

Alternatively you can rebuild PROJ with the same C library options as your
main project.  I think you would want to add /MDd to the CFLAGS definition
in makefile.vc.

Best regards,

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] proj-api.h
Message-ID: <36.1b978914.28d237a3@aol.com>

The proj-api.h does not seem to support the following proj.4 functions.

rtodms
nad_init
nad_cvt
nad_free

I have extensive applications that use these, as well as pj_init, pj_fwd, 
pj_inv, pj_free that I am taking from a unix environment to VC++/MFC.

I have tried modifying proj-api.h to include the above functions, but I seem 
to be missing something.  pj_transform did not exist when my applications 
were originally built and it would be a major undertaking to change all this 
existing code.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] PROJ 4.4.4 Release
Message-ID: <3BA435D3.1050202@pobox.com>

Folks,

I have prepared a new PROJ.4 release, version 4.4.4.  I am issing this release
primarily to get a new version of the epsg initialization file out there.  The
one released in 4.4.3 was badly broken for all LCC projections, and any
projections with non-meter units.  Noteably, this made the state plane support
done via the epsg initialization file next to useless.

This is also intended to be the release to correspond with MapServer 3.5, and
I suppose the GDAL/OGR 1.1.5.

The new code is available at:

   ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/proj-4.4.4.tar.gz
   ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/proj-4.4.4.zip

The full changelog reads:

2001-09-15  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam at pobox.com>

	* src/geocent.c: I have modified the Convert_Geodetic_To_Geocentric()
	function to clamp Latitudes just a little out of the range
	-PI/2 to PI/2 and to no longer do error checks on Longitudes since
	they will be auto-wrapped by sin() and cos().

	See http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17

	* nad/epsg: commited new updates with fixed units for us state plane
	zones in feet, as reported by Marc-Andre.

2001-08-23  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam at pobox.com>

	* src/makefile.vc: improved the setting of PROJ_LIB defaults.

	* src/pj_open_lib.c: added the pj_set_finder() entry point.

	* nad/epsg: fixed all LCC projections.  The parameters were badly
	mixed up.

2001-08-11  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam at pobox.com>

	* src/proj.c: Generate an error message if +proj=latlong is used with
	this program.  As per bugzilla bug 70.

2001-06-01  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam at pobox.com>

	* makefile.vc: emess.c directly linked into mainline programs.

	* pj_errno.c: added pj_get_errno_ref().

2001-05-14  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam at pobox.com>

	* upraded config.sub and config.guess as per debian bug report 97374.

With our two-man developer team, I cannot even think about roll-our-own
even if we have the knowledge and the time.
We are working on a commercial product featuring the Proj4, scheduled to be
released by next year.

Marc,

Well, whether it makes sense to roll your own or not depends on alot of
factors.  However, I would stress that few geospatial software companies
roll their complete own projections library.  If you want to support a variety
of projections it can be difficult to do well.

I don't know about complete sorries about these companies, but I do know that
Global Geomatics, Avenza, Softmap, and Cubewerx all use portions of PROJ.4
in their software.  I also know that some of the "mainline" GIS and
Geospatial software companies used adapted forms of other public libraries,
such as GCTP at PCI.  A number of vendors also use commercial projections
libraries from Blue Marble and Mentor Software.

If you are looking for commercial support, you can talk to Mentor or Blue
Marble.  If you want customized support for PROJ.4 you could talk to me.
If you want a really clean code base you can munge as desired, you might
want to look at the geotrans code adapted in OSSIM or GeoTrans on it's
own (it's a little easier to understand than PROJ.4).

I would also like to stress that one way or the other, the world doesn't
need another way of describing projections.  If you do roll your own, at
least consider tieing into something like OpenGIS Well Known Text format
for describing your coordinate systems.

What is GeoTrans?  The only one I know about is the "Geographic Translator"
that is part of the Department of Defense Joint Mapping Tool Kit (JMTK).
That is "For Official Use Only,"  and certainly is NOT available for
commercial development outside of DoD channels.  Is there another package
around that is using that acronym ?

In regard to ALL the commercial applications as well as the "Public Domain"
applications, only the POSC "EPSG" system/documentation comes close to what
is truly useful in foreign countries outside of Canada/USA/Mexico stuff.
Everything else is for thematic/small-scale stuff.  Large-scale stuff used
for 1:50,000, 1:25,000 and larger (1:1,000) is generally too exacting for
the Public Domain concoctions.  The EPSG is intended to be accurate to
better than a meter, if memory serves me correctly.  Good enough for
looking for oil, but NOT good enough to locate property corners in an urban
environment.

If you're doing thematic/regional stuff, the Public Domain software as well
as the commercial "canned" software is adequate.  If you're locating
telephone/power poles, fire hydrants, water valves, etc. the commercial
stuff is useless outside of the U.S.  If you are doing property corners,
cadastral applications, land titlization work; the canned stuff is a
guaranteed disaster because there is no acknowledgement for specific
projection formulae variations for each different country.  The errors in
coordinate transformations for those applications can be maddening if you
don't know what you're doing ...

Which is good for what depends on your intended application.

One size does NOT fit all.  For geodetic applications, it's like dancing in
a snakepit.

Norman,

What you refer to is a long-obsolete version.  The latest stuff is not
"free" to the public, and it's still not adequate for civilian-style large
scale mapping.  However, that DOES answer my question regarding what the
OSRS-PROJ group refers to as "GeoTrans."

we will soon release a commercial application that uses PROJ.
It will be free software, so I like you to not set equal commercial
and proprietary. In the area of free software you will  find several
products using PROJ. Frank, how about maintaining a list
of all the products (free and not free) that use PROJ?

I recommend not to develop your own projection. The costs would
be immense where testing would take the most.
You can better spend far less money when you adopt a free software
library and pay the maintainer to quickly fix or extend where needed.
So, PROJ itself is a commercial product (Frank Warmerdam can
offer professional service for PROJ and from my personal
experience he is doing a very good job).

All the best

	Jan

I recently (two months ago) received the email below regarding the

I ever pretended to be <g>.  When I first downloaded the software
(probably 2 years ago or so) I did register as a user, and the email did

I have never needed to use it for commercial purposes, so I've never
looked into the license restrictions (if any).  This is not "long

Norman,

What you refer to is a long-obsolete version.  The latest stuff is not
"free" to the public, and it's still not adequate for civilian-style
large
scale mapping.  However, that DOES answer my question regarding what the
OSRS-PROJ group refers to as "GeoTrans."

Sorry - here's the email I received.  I've received several updates over
the last two years.

	- Ed

GEOTRANS users,

	GEOTRANS version 2.2.1 has just been released and is now
available.
Platforms supported include Windows NT 4.0 & 2000, Solaris 2.5.1 and
later.
Some of the changes incorporated into GEOTRANS since the 2.0.3 and 2.1
releases include:

 - Diagrams in Users' Guide and the on-line help showing MGRS grid zone,
band, and 100,000m square layouts.

 - Four new projections:  Ney's (Modified Lambert Conformal Conic),
Stereographic, British National Grid, and New Zealand Map Grid. 
(These were added in 2.2.  Azimuthal Equidistant, Gnomonic, and Oblique
Mercator were added in 2.1.)

 - More flexible support for delimiters in input files (commas,
tabs, spaces)

 - Special F-16 Grid Reference System, a special version of MGRS.

 - 90% CE, 90% LE, and 90% SE accuracy values for input coordinates can
be
specified.  These are used, along with datum transformation accuracy
information, in deriving the output coordinate accuracy values.

 - A pull-down menu of coordinate sources, including GPS, maps, and
digital
geospatial data can be selected to automatically set input
accuracy values.

 - A fully functional Java GUI version.

The new release of GEOTRANS is now available through the NIMA GEOTRANS
download page on the various NIMA networks and through the Internet and
can
be downloaded if you have a .mil or .gov URL.

Alternatively, if you are a registered user and have received a copy of
GEOTRANS in the past, the software will be made temporarily available
for
download through the JMTK FTP site.  In order to obtain the software
from
this site, you must request a username and password from the JMTK help
desk.
You can contact the JMTK help desk by e-mailing them at
jmtkhelp at jmtk.org or
calling 1-888-549-JMTK.  The compressed packages containing the GEOTRANS
files are about 10MB and should be easily downloadable by anyone with a
good
internet connection.  If you arrange for a download through the JMTK FTP
site, please let the JMTK Help Desk know when you have downloaded it, or
if
you decide not to download it, as this is a temporary account that will
be turned off.

As a third option, you may request a CD-ROM that will be sent by mail.
Again, contact the JMTK Help Desk to request a CD.  Please provide your
name
and mailing address where you would like the CD sent.  Also, provide
your
phone number and e-mail address so that we may notify you about future
upgrades.

We hope you find the new GEOTRANS useful.  Please let us know if you
have
any questions, comments, or problems to report.

Paul,

I can't give a detailed comparison but these are a few things that stuck out
to me, though some of them could easily be wrong.

GeoTrans:
  o The code is more readable.  If you want to read code for individual
    projections to see how they are implemented, this is a good package.
  o Good integration with military identifiers for datums.
  o No simple textural format for describing coordinate systems.
  o No user level tools, just an API.
  o No active user group, though the package does appear to be actively
    maintained by someone within the military.

Proj.4:
  o Code not all that useful for reference.
  o Has it's own unique list of datums, but recently has added good
    integration with EPSG (via EPSG init file) making coordinate system
    definition translation easier.
  o Simple, fairly well documented textual format for describing coordinate
    systems.
  o user level tools (ie. proj.exe, cs2cs.exe) as well as API.
  o Active user group and "public" maintenance.

I have no experience with the comparitive accuracy of the two packages, though
Geotrans is apparently carefully audited for at least the things that matter
to the funding agency (NIMA?).

Note, there are a number of other worthwhile public projections
implementations.  I just listed geotrans before as an example because I
know the code is quite readable, and if you want to "adapt-your-own" it
might be a good base.

Mark:
 
We have been using the original version of Proj.4 in our products for several 
years in our C/Unix-based software products.  A couple of years ago, we used 
the MKS Nutcracker software development environment to port our products to 
PC platforms.  Today, we are completing full conversion and testing of our 
products into native MS/C++/MFC versions for PC's.
 
>From the beginning, Proj.4 worked as advertised, and we had very few problems 
with the library.  Programmer interface documentation was not real good, but 
enough to get Proj.4 working in our products. Gerald Evenden personally 
provided good support when needed, along with lots of great nostalgia.  Our 
prior experience was with GCTP, and we knew we didn't want to use that in our 
products.
 
With MKS, the original C/Unix source codes were compiled pretty much as is, 
including the Proj.4 library.  We mostly had problems setting up the X-Server 
part of NutCracker, but once those were solved, everything worked fine.  If 
you are a Unix person, MKS provides all major Unix functionality on a PC, 
concurrent with MS Windows, which is nice.

We've had no formal training in using Visual C++/MFC, but got most of our new 
software working recently, except for integrating Proj.4.  We first tried to 
build the old library and integrate that into our products, but ran into a 
lot of problems that, with our lack of VCC experience, we couldn't easily 
solve.

After a little research, we realized there were newer versions of Proj.4 
available, including a makefile for VC++.  Here, we had two problems: The 
first was something about incompatible libraries, causing linking to fail.  
The second was that the programmer interface to Proj.4 had changed.

With tons of source code calls to Proj.4, a tight schedule, and what seemed 
to be an absence of documentation on the new programmer interfaces, we 
decided to tweak the makefile.vc and use that to compile the old library 
under VC++.  Surpassingly, it worked, and linked up OK.  All our old Proj.4 
calls are functioning correctly.  We still have one little problem with 
competing C and VC++ libraries being incompatible in our release version, but 
we'll get that worked out.

Our software products primarily support production mosaicking, 
transformation, quality assurance and keyword header editing of USGS DOQQs, 
and are used by the USGS, their contractors and DOQQ users for quality 
assurance and mosaicking of those products.  Besides marketing our software 
products, we use our mosaicking and transformation software in support of our 
in-house production contracts in support of the USGS IP program.

Once we get all our products going with the old Proj.4 we intend to get 
smarter with both MS/VC++/MFC and the latest Proj.4 releases, upgrade our 
existing products to the latest Proj.4 version, and get on with seriously 
delayed new product development and production backlog.

Bottom line is that the old Proj.4 stuff has worked just fine for us in 
covering all UTM and SPCS projections over the Continental US.  Proj.4 has a 
lot of usage history, reliability and credibility that a do-it-yourself 
package would take a long time to acqire and prove.  You also now have this 
user support group.

Sorry this is so long.

Claude,

These aren't the same projection definitions as found in the EPSG tables
(at least the EPSG 4.3 tables) which is an LCC 1SP projection with a scaling
factor.  How did you derive your projections, and are they equivelent to
the EPSG projections?  I am hesitant to incorporate them into the EPSG file
without greater confidence about their relationship to the EPSG definition.

You'll find here where I found the parameters and epsg code. I waiting for your
advice on all that, but all I can says that it works quite fine (I did test quite
a few reference point; we are using extensively mapserver and proj to build an
interactive sites where peoeple will have the opportunity to georeferenced routes
for mountaineering sports in the alps, to be released soon). I know that quite a
few people were waiting for the parameters for (france, switzerland, italy,
spain, austria) for use with proj so I decided to spent a little time on it.
Don't forget to give me your advice or to propose better solution.

Tell me if you need more information

SWITZERLAND: 9814
- http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/swiss_oblique_cylindrical.html
for swis oblique cylindrical where you can found the code 9814

The definitions are at the following address (in english):
http://www.swisstopo.ch/en/geo/refsys.htm

You'll find a more complete explanation "Formulas and constants for the
calculation of the Swiss conformal cylindrical projection and for the
transformation between coordinate systems" in this pdf file:
ftp://ftp.swisstopo.ch/pub/data/geo/refsyse.pdf

In these different files, they propose tu use the geocentric transformation
parameters to the european reference system ETRS89 (which is very close to
WGS84):

X(ETRS89) = X(CH1903) + 674.374 m
Y(ETRS89) = Y(CH1903) + 15.056 m
Z(ETRS89) = Z(CH1903) + 405.346 m

(without scale factor or rotations)

I tested these parameters with cs2cs, and it gave good result (usually below 1
meter)


Meilleure solution:
Prendre les parametres entre ch1903+ et CHTRS95 (qui tres proche de ETRS89 et de
WGS84)
XCH1903+ = XCHTRS95 - 674.374 m
YCH1903+ = YCHTRS95 - 15.056 m
ZCH1903+ = ZCHTRS95 - 405.346 m
which gives +towgs84=674.374,15.056,405.346

The old solution is to take the Granit Parameter (7 parameter). Granit87
parameters were used between 1987 and 1997 for the transformation between CH1903
and
WGS84. They do not recommend their use anymore:
dX = 660.077 m
dY = 13.551 m
dZ = 369.344 m
rx = 2.484 cc (centesimal seconds) = 0.804997 arcs seconds
ry = 1.783 cc (centesimal seconds) = 0.578004 arcs seconds
rz = 2.939 cc (centesimal seconds) = 0.951997 arcs seconds
s = 1.00000566 (m = 5.66 ppm)

I tried these parameters (arc seconds) with cs2cs, but it didn't give good
results. Error of up to 20 meters. I tried all the possible configuration of sign
without success.

You'll find an online pages for coordinate transformation swiss_ch1903 <-> wgs84:

FRANCE: 275xxx

Epsg number where taken from:
- http://inovagis.dcea.fct.unl.pt/giserver/epsg.asp where I found number for
france
Note that in this list there are only 27581 to 27584, with 27582 described as
NTF(Paris)/Lambert II (etendu)(etendu=extended). There is no difference between
NTF(Paris)/Lambert II (etendu)
and NTF(Paris)/Lambert II except a 2000000 shift in y_0. the "etendu" of LII
version in used to described the entire France (the digital raster map from IGN
are georeferenced in LII etendu). As I need both LII and LII etendu it seemed
more logical for me to use 27581 to 27584 for the normal zone and to add 27585
for the etendu (I don't know why there are not 2 different numberr for LII and
LII etendu).
The 27591-94 are the carto version, and represent coordinates printed on the map
(but no used for georeferencing the). It is actually the same definition as the
27581-84 execept that the number of the zone is put in front of the coordinate
written in kilometer in zone three, 254000 becomes 3254.
You'll find all the parameters describing the french system at:
http://www.ign.fr/fr/PI/activites/geodesie/coordonnees.html
(only in french, official site of the French National Geographic Institute)

You'll find also a few pdf files and software (coordinate transformation) to
download at:

Hello,

Can anyone tell me about commercial apps using Proj4 for their projection
engine? I'm trying to make a case against roll-our-own for my boss.

cheers

I have not found any document about how to use proj 4. as a library in my 
program. I know, that it works like that, but I don't know how. Where I can 
find an information about that? I use gcc and a russian clone of Red Hat Linux

Igor, 


Try "man pj_init" to read the API documentation.  I think there is also some
further information in one of the PostScript or PDF files but I am not sure
which .  Luckily the API is pretty simple.

Best regards,
