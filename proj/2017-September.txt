The procedure to integrate a new EPSG database in libgeotiff ==> GDAL ==> proj.4 + PostGIS 
is described at:
https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/browser/trunk/libgeotiff/csv/README

If not done by anyone else, I generally run it a couple of months before each GDAL major 
release to avoid doing it too often.

Depends on the issue... Technically if it is an issue in the initial python import script, should be 
in geotiff Trac. If it is an issue in the GDAL epsg_tr.py script / importFromEPSG() / missing 
mapping from a method, then in GDAL. If it is missing support for a projection in proj.4, in 
proj github issues.

It isn't obvious to me that the trick you describe above can be reused for those grids, but 
they will indeed require code additions in proj.4 and GDAL. Looking at
https://www.epsg-registry.org/export.htm?wkt=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::6244
and
https://www.epsg-registry.org/export.htm?wkt=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::6245
use a "Colombia Urban" projection method that isn't AFAIK currently handled by proj.4 and 
GDAL.

This Columbian Urban projection is described in paragraph 1.3.19 of
http://www.epsg.org/Portals/0/373-07-2.pdf , so could be served as the base to add support 
for it in proj.4

They didn't get dropped. As far as I can see they are new in EPSG v9.1. "http://www.epsg.org/
EPSGDataset/WhatIsNew.aspx" : "New data for ... United States (AZ and WI)"

Subject: [Proj] Realigning velocity grid values by Helmert shift - is that
	normal?
Message-ID: <2E885BB293AF0448A0181138489E9A0EAEA3C8F9@S000013.PROD.SITAD.DK>

All,

In the ongoing effort of improving geodetic capabilities in PROJ.4 I've run into what I think is an unusual situation. Before I dismiss it as such, I would like to check with the list if this is more common than I think and it should receive special attention in PROJ.4. The topic is realignment of a gridded velocity model with a Helmert transform.

I want to do transformations from ITRF2014 to ETRS89 in Scandinacia, using the transformations defined by the Nordic Geodetic Commision (NKG). The transformations are described by Häkli et al in [0]. For this transformation to work in PROJ.4 a velocity model operation is needed, which I intend to implement. Additionally, in this particular transformation a realignment of the velocity model is made with a Helmert shift. I am trying to determine the best way to handle this, hopefully the response to this post will help me do that. First a bit of background.

Because of the post glacial uplift in the Scandinavian countries the usual EUREF transformations between various ITRFs and ETRS89 is not accurate enough, and hence the NKG has defined its own transformations from the various ITRF's to the local Scandinavian/Nordic realizations of ETRS89. All transformations go through a common reference frame, NKG_ETRF00, making it easier to bring data from the different countries into the same reference frame.

The NKG_ETRF00 is defined as ETRF2000 at epoch 2000.0 adjusted for the post glacial uplift. The adjustment is done by applying a velocity model. This velocity model is a grid-based model originating from a GPS campaign in 2003, whereas the transformation described in [0] is based on a campaign from 2008. The results from the 2008 campaign reveals that the velocity model is not a good fit for the new data, and hence an adjustment is made to the model. In anticipation of a new velocity model being released soon, the original model is instead used by applying a Helmert shift to the gridded velocities. That is, the individual grid-values are realigned with a Helmert shift.

I have not come across a solution like this before, so it strikes me as being a bit odd. It's a clever solution to the problem, but not very easy to work with in a generic transformation software as PROJ.4. It works out fine mathematically and in custom scripts, but I find it a bit hard to incorporate into the transformation pipeline framework, since it is parameters that are being transformed, and not coordinates. The simplest solution is to just create a new gridded model where the correction has been applied, and using it with a "velocitygrid" operation. Another option would be to incorporate the Helmert shift into the velocitygrid operation so that the realignment can be performed when loading the grid. A third option is to introduces some a form of nested operation in the pipeline framework.

I don't want to make things more complicated than they need to be, so I will only consider option two and three above if the concept of "realigning gridded velocity models by Helmert shift" is a somewhat common operation. I have not come across a similar transformation before. Do other transformations that use a similar operation exist?

Best regards,
Kristian

Hi Kristian,

I have rather questions than feedback than geodesy business feedback ;-)

What is the typical format into which you can store those gridded velocities: one of the 
existing supported grid formats ?

So the parameters of this Helmert Transform are always the same for a given grid ? Or per 
year and/or country ? (this is probably explained in the paper...) If there's just one set of 
parameter for the grid, this would perhaps make sense to have a pre-processing script to 
correct the velocity grid.

> Another option

Performed when *loading* the grid (ie correcting all values of the grid), or rather performed 
when selecting the particular velocity of the grid that applies to the coordinate being 
transformed ? The former could have performance implications if the grid is big and you need 
to transform only a couple of coordinates.

Option 3 sounds like a complication in the general framework. Would probably require some 
parenthesing syntax.

Hi Even, good questions. Might not be" geodesy business" but still helpful.



> What is the typical format into which you can store those gridded velocities: one of the existing supported grid formats ?

The grid that I have access to now is in a custom format used in the old Danish transformation library TrLib. It is a 3D-grid, but I would convert that to a 2D-grid in NTv2 format for the horizontal parts and a 1D-grid for the vertical part (gtx-format). So yes, formats already supported by PROJ.4.

The bigger issue here is using the existing code for something else that simple coordinate offsets. If I remember correctly it is a bit complicated reading a single grid cell value with current setup. A bit of refactoring is probably warranted.


> So the parameters of this Helmert Transform are always the same for a given grid ? Or per year and/or country ? (this is probably explained in the paper...) If there's just one set of parameter for the grid, this would perhaps make sense to have a pre-processing script to correct the velocity grid.

Yes, always the same parameters. You multiply the grid cells by the timespan from the grid epoch to the desired epoch. That is why it is possible to create a derived grid. It is the solution I prefer, but it does have the slight problem of not being the official transformation. I don't mind that per se, but I do think it is best to implement transformations as close as possible to the original definition.


> Performed when *loading* the grid (ie correcting all values of the grid), or rather performed when selecting the particular velocity of the grid that applies to the coordinate being transformed ? The former could have performance implications if the grid is big and you need to transform only a couple of coordinates.

Implementation detail :-) Your latter proposal would be the way to go.


> Option 3 sounds like a complication in the general framework. Would probably require some parenthesing syntax.

Yes. It is not a path I want to go down, unless absolutely forced to. But it *could* solve the problem.

Actually that was one of the cases anticipated by adding the "observation"
registers in the PJ_OBS data type: You could have one step in the pipeline
filling in stuff in the registers, passing them on to the next step, which
would combine them with the coordinate stuff in whichever way it wants to.

This was also one of the reasons to introduce the switch that makes it
possible to mute steps in either forward or backward execution of the
pipeline (you want parameters filled in before the step using them, so need
to mirror the operation in cases of backward execution).

So no pipeline-parenthesis needed - just put some slightly over-engineered
elements from the early design phase into practical use :-)

That being said: I would certainly prefer one of the other solutions!

Message-ID: <CAEEbjBgKYSiovd_rhBZ6P9dOt25iAHeRWXtfkmkUWmmzxkVFdw@mail.gmail.com>

When transforming positions with DHHN92 (EPSG:5783) height data, to Bessel
based projections are returned.
For my area (Berlin, Germany) the lowest height is just over 24 meters.
Transformations using 34.79 all return  -6.13930772151798 when using
ST_Transform, which performs a pj_transform in the background.
Using -6.13930772151798 to transform back will return the original value.

Between WSG84 and epsg:25833 there are no problems.

I would be interested in learning the reason why this is so.

Here some cs2cs samples with the results:

There ED50 / UTM zone 30N, epsg:23030 was being used.

The dhhn92 values are based on Amsterdam as 0, so what happen there on
similar conditions? Drops down to -40 meters?

Hello Mark, 

The z values are being treated as ellipsoidal heights. Nowhere have you given any 
information to PROJ.4 that they are any particular vertical coordinate reference 
system. The transformation methods supported by the +wgs84 parameter work strictly 
with ellipsoidal heights, not geoidal or other gravity-related heights.

If you know you have gravity-related heights, you can either not pass them and ignore 
the output ellipsoidal heights or pass them, but replace them with the input gravity-
related heights. One reason to go ahead and pass in the gravity-related heights is 
that they may approximate the ellipsoidal heights in the area better than using zeroes.

Also, you could use EGM96 to approximate the geoid height and back that out of the elevation to get a SWAG of the ellipsoid height.

If you are working with non-ellipsoidal heights you can use grid files. One
for the horizontal (lat/long shifts. Note proj4 internally converts your
units if not in lat long already) and one for the vertical (eg. metres)
datum shift to WGS84 ellipsoid (or a close approximation).

eg. for Great Britain Ordnance Datum heights (above the geoid):
from +proj=tmerc +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-2 +k=0.9996012717 +x_0=400000
+y_0=-100000 +ellps=airy +nadgrids=C:\temp\OSTN15_NTv2_OSGBtoETRS.gsb
+geoidgrids=c:\temp\OSGM15_GTX_OSGBtoGRS80.gtx +units=m +no_defs
to +proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +no_defs

Most national mapping agencies publish these grid files, or you can find
them searching online.

Subject: [Proj] Need a projection like Azimuthal Equidistant (AEQD),
 but with polar coordinates. Do you have one?
Message-ID: <1506105233610-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

I have a geotiff in a simple *latlon* projection. I want to reproject its
data on a plane tangential to Earth ellipsoid to make some further
calculations.

Just now I'm using *aeqd* projection for it, but I'm looking for some
similar projection that would give me not cartesian, but *polar*
coordinates.

To reproject my geotiff raster I'm using *rasterio.reproject(...)* to
convert my geotiff data (it's a good analog of *cs2cs* utility from
*PROJ.4*):


*lat_center* and *lon_center* were the center of my geotiff.

*aeqd* projection gives me some raster in cartesian grid (*x_j* and *y_i* on
the tangential plane):

<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/t381822/1cPVU.png> 

But for my purposes it needs some extra interpolation to get the values in
my polar mesh (by distance and azimuth on the tangent plane). Can you advice
me some other projection?

Is there a c program source that can take a list of x/y/z points for a
source and destination and calculate a valid 7 parameter +towgs84 value
that could be used with cs2cs?

I found something similar at http://helmparms3d.sourceforge.net/, called
helmparms3d - but it seems calculate values that cannot be used for
+towgs84.

Hi
That program provides the rotation matrix and not the angles, but you can
easily convert them from radians to arcseconds, to use in string +towgs84.
Check the formulas in page 134 of document http://www.epsg.org/Portals/0/
373-07-2.pdf. <http://www.epsg.org/Portals/0/373-07-2.pdf> PROJ.4 uses the
Position Vector" standard.
You can get the angles from matrix elements:
Rz = -r12 * 3600 *180 / PI
Ry = r13 * 3600 * 180 / PI
Rx = -r23 * 3600 * 180 / PI

The scale factor must be converted to scale difference in ppm:
DS = (s-1) * 1000000

You don't need to change translation vector components.

Regards

José Gonçalves

José Gonçalves:: thank you for your answer, especially about which method
PROJ.4 uses (Position Vector).
Unfortunately this solution does not bring the expected result.

The original problem was the the DHDN bessel setting
(+towgs84=598.1,73.7,418.2,0.202,0.045,-2.455,6.7)
does not bring usable results for heights.
A manully worked
out +towgs84=598.1,73.7,418.2,0.201,0.049430,-2.455,0.2685935, gets near to
the expected result.

But when trying to use the +towgs84 value with cs2cs:

4383595.094518717 -889411.002599155 2829803.867439098

the result is completely off.
So something is still not correct.

I don't think the program is designed for trasnformations between 
different projections. EPSG:25833 is transverse mercator, while 
EPSG:3068 is Cassini-Soldner.

Helmert parameters are calculated on Earth-centered XYZ coordinates of 
two different ellipsoids. See the sample test data at sourceforge.net

Hi,

As original maintainer of the Windows CE port, I can confirm
I no longer use it.
Even if there are users, they should survive using CMake.

So, I propose to remove it

Can I remove the wince/msvc80 folder and any mentions of Windows CE,
if found anywhere?

Subject: [Proj] Current master still at released 4.9.3?
Message-ID: <CABUeae_-qxY6CeSMMPHK3YUwbkajoUMyp2pJFasvr9ZpiQPfkA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

TL;TR: Shouldn't the current master be at 4.9.3 plus 'one'?

I'm very late to the party since PROJ.4 moved to GitHub and
I also haven't been able to find any related posts in the archives,
(apart from the talk about 4.10.0 as next), sorry I'm missing
versioning/tagging policies.

The current release is 4.9.3, it is tagged in the repo.

But, in the master, the 'big four' still declares 4.9.3

https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L34
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/configure.ac#L4
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/proj.spec#L2
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/src/proj_api.h#L43

Isn't it confusing that the development head declares the same
version as the released one?
Shouldn't master be one step ahead?

I'm not discussing what it should, 4.9.4 or 4.10.0, it doesn't
really matter for development/unreleased branch, I think.

Best regards,

Hello Mateusz,

There was a somewhat related discussion about the next version number that
started on Jun 22.  Thread top link:
http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2017-June/007697.html

I don't remember the outcome, but I don't think there was a consensus.  The
version number may reflect API changes that are backward
compatible/incompatible.

Thanks,
Micah

Thanks for the link, interesting discussion, however, it's heavy weight.

My question doesn't try to go that far strategically.

Mine is just about using different numbers thab the last  released.

I am also +1 on this.

I suggest that we keep it in version 4.10.0/4.9.4 (whatever it ends up being), and announce in the release notes that this will be the final version with support for  WinCE. That way anyone who still rely on it has amble time to react.

proj.h has a different version number, but probably not the correct one either:

https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/src/proj.h#L157

My guess is that no one really thought about changing version numbers. I agree that it is confusing. Somehow indicating the development status of builds  that are made between releases would be nice. Perhaps by adding the commit hash to the version number?

Perhaps one-for-all VERSION file would be better to maintain the number.

Yes.

> Perhaps by adding the commit hash to the version number?

IMO, version should always have X.Y.Z  format, without
any suffixes like -dev, etc.

AFAIK, typical practice is that after releasing X.Y.Z,
development branch bumps to X.Y+1.Z.

Why not bump to 4.10.0?
It wouldn't mean a promise to version next release as 4.10.0.
It would just mean the master is ahead of release.
If master introduces incompatible API, it may become 5.0.0,
it is unknown.
