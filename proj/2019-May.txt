Subject: [PROJ] question about EPSG:3003
Message-ID: <2937eae7ba5b5c897637ca5c3300c335@lqt.it>

I notice an unpleasant regression in the proj-string returned by
proj_as_proj_string() for EPSG:3003 Monte Mario / Italy zone 1
in all previous versions, accordingly to the string returned by
calling the GDAL function OSRExportToProj4(), this was defined
as follows:

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 \
+ellps=intl +towgs84=-104.1,-49.1,-9.9,0.971,-2.917,0.714,-11.68 \
+units=m +no_defs

but in PROJ.6 the string returned by calling proj_as_proj_string()
is now:

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 \
+ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs +type=crs

as you can notice, the +towgs84 member has been suppressed,
and the sad practical consequence is that any transformation
based on the above proj-string (as e.g. from EPSG:4326 to
EPSG:3003) is now shifted by about 75 metres (at least, this
is true on Tuscany).

if I remember well after so many years, PROJ.4/GDAL initially
supported a definition for 3003 lacking the +towgs84 member,
and this caused endless troubles to all italian users.
but since 2012 (more or less) PROJ.4/GDAL started supporting
a revised proj-string including the +towgs84 member, and it
was an highly appreciated improvement.
now PROJ.6 seems to mark a bad regression to the dark past.

note: this is not at all an issue for new SpatiaLite versions
fully based on PROJ.6, because in this case ST_Transform()
will use by default the CRS definitions retrieved from the
PROJ.6 own SQLite database.
but nevertheless a very dangerous scenario exists.
imagine some SpatiaLite database created by a recent
version based on PROJ.6
in this case the "spatial_ref_sys" table will be
populated by inserting the proj-strings returned
by proj_as_proj_string().
if such a database will be connected in a second
time to some earlier version of SpatiaLite still
based on old PROJ.4 (a not at all uncommon practice
in the  peculiar world of spatialite) any call to
ST_Transform() will then be based on the proj-strings
stored into "spatial_ref_sys", and any transformation
to/from srid=3003 will be inexorably affected by
severe shifts.

any idea/comment/suggestion about this ?

bye Sandro

p.s. the same identical issue affects srids
3004, 23032 and 23033

Hi Sandro,

First, if you instanciate with proj_create() / proj_create_from_database() and 
export with proj_as_proj_string(), you'll never get a towgs84 clause.
Since the CRS by itself has no transformation clause.
However if you look at the output of the projinfo utility or 
OSRImportFromEPSG(), you may, sometimes, get a towgs84 clause when exporting 
to PROJ string (e.g with EPSG:4322 / WGS72), because they use the 
proj_crs_create_bound_crs_to_WGS84() function which tries to find the most 
precise transformation from the CRS to EPSG:4326, and, that's the important 
point, which is valid for the whole area of use of the CRS.

For EPSG:3003, there are however 3 possibilities (you can ignore the last one 
in the below output), none of which cover the whole area of use of the 
projected CRS.

$ src/projinfo -s EPSG:3003 -t EPSG:4326 --spatial-test intersects --summary
Candidate operations found: 4
unknown id, Inverse of Italy zone 1 + Monte Mario to WGS 84 (4), 4 m, Italy - 
mainland
unknown id, Inverse of Italy zone 1 + Monte Mario to WGS 84 (2), 4 m, Italy - 
Sardinia onshore
unknown id, Inverse of Italy zone 1 + Monte Mario to WGS 84 (11), 10 m, Italy 
- Sicily Strait west of 13°E
unknown id, Inverse of Italy zone 1 + Ballpark geographic offset from Monte 
Mario to WGS 84, unknown accuracy, World, has ballpark transformation

Previous PROJ version hard-coded the transformation that has the largest area 
of use, but that's not necessarily ideal in all use cases (Sardinia or Sicily)

So, this is intended behaviour. I'm campaigning here and on all relevants 
channels: "With PROJ 6, PROJ strings to express CRS are very suboptimal. They 
should be restricted to express a transformation pipeline"

If you want Spatialite to have the same behaviour as before regarding 
generation of PROJ strings, you could possibly use the 
proj_create_operations() API to list the possible transformations, by setting 
proj_operation_factory_context_set_spatial_criterion(PROJ_SPATIAL_CRITERION_PARTIAL_INTERSECTION) 
on the factory_ctx, pickup the one that has the largest area of use, create 
the final bound CRS with that transformation with proj_crs_create_bound_crs(), 
and export it to a PROJ string.
Admitedly, we could have a releaxed proj_crs_create_bound_crs_to_WGS84() 
implementation in PROJ itself to do that, but I'm not sure if we really need 
to replicate/encourage past suboptimal behaviour.

Hello, I'm trying  to install PROJ 5.0.0 or above with a Travis configuration.

The only way I can get it to work is to build from source - does
anyone know a ppa/apt pathway to get PROJ >=5.0.0 that works in a
.travis.yml?

Thank you,

Subject: [PROJ] Getting "proj" and "datum" for a CRS
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjgOoK=cSjLz5UmJcDDvxAJjavvtGt-tFeZME7M=X1oMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Next question:

If I have a crs created from a proj string like:

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=102 +k=0.9999 +x_0=500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84
+units=m +no_defs +type=crs

1. How can I get the "tmerc" acronym from the proj API? If I
call proj_crs_get_coordoperation and
then proj_coordoperation_get_method_info I can retrieve the method name,
but this is a long version of this value (ie. ."Transverse Mercator", not
the tmerc acronym)

2. How can I get the ellipsoid/datum value? Again, I can
call proj_get_ellipsoid to get an ellipsoid, and from that I've been
using proj_get_id_auth_name/proj_get_id_code. But this only sometimes gives
a value, and ideally I'm trying to retrieve the "WGS84" value used in the
original proj string.

(I'm trying to use the official proj methods to retrieve these values -
without resorting to regex parsing)

3. Using proj_as_proj_string sometimes results in errors like:
"proj_as_proj_string: Unsupported conversion method: Lambert Conic
Conformal (West Orientated)". I'm guessing this indicates that there's NO
way of representing that projection using proj strings, and I'm wasting my
time if I try to work around this?

Rebuild the proj package for Ubuntu and host in your own repo or PPA,
and add this repo/PPA to Travis.

Another alternative:

I am using 19.04 disco via docker to get proj 5.2.0.  However, support for
19.04 won't last that long, so I'll have to switch to 19.10 by the end of
this year and eventually to 20.4 LTS.

https://github.com/dwcaress/MB-System/blob/master/.travis.yml
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/disco/+source/proj
https://www.ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle

You could also use debian testing.  I might suggest avoiding debian
unstable and exp.

Nyall,

For 1, try giving proj_pj_info() a go. I am not sure that it will work in all situations (a compound CRS will probably not behave as you might want/expect). There’s currently not a similar function for retrieving the ellipsoid id, but it can be added to proj_pj_info() if needed. You are welcome to submit a PR with such a change (if you are quick it can be part of 6.1.0).

As Kristian said, there's no such methods.

Yes, there are a few projection methods in the EPSG dataset which aren't 
supported by PROJ

I'd note that adding a new member to PJ_PROJ_INFO will change the ABI in a 
incompatible manner. Will/would require a libtool 'current' bump

A possibility is to build from source + ccache + enabling Travis caching of 
$HOME/.ccache + ./configure --disable-static . That should keep the time spent 
in PROJ building to a few seconds generally.

Subject: [PROJ] Transforming between ITRF realizations
Message-ID: <2efdb276-87b3-d1ee-9ac1-0b995d205c1b@nsidc.org>

Hello,

I have a number of elevation datasets that each use a different ITRF 
realization. The coordinates in these datasets are referenced to the 
WGS84 ellipsoid. An example lon, lat, elev(meters above ellipsoid) tuple 
would be:

-117.61748591770593, 59.496749040316935, 329.39612

According to the proj4 documentation on Helmert transformations 
(https://proj4.org/operations/transformations/helmert.html), I should be 
able to use something like this to convert between ITRF2000 and ITRF93:

proj +proj=helmert +convention=position_vector +x=0.0127 +y=0.0065 
+z=-0.0209 +s=0.00195 +dx=-0.0029 +dy=-0.0002 +dz=-0.0006 +ds=0.00001 
+rx=-0.00039 +ry=0.00080 +rz=-0.00114 +drx=-0.00011 +dry=-0.00019 
+drz=0.00007 +t_epoch=1988.0

However, entering my coordinates yield the following result:

0.05    -0.01 329.39612

I've used proj4 previously, but not to do transformations between 
different ITRF realizations. I suspect I am missing something, but I 
have not had revelations yet. Any suggestions or insight would be 
greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

Trey Stafford

Hi Trey,

I tried it with pyproj and I got one answer:
>>> from pyproj import Transformer
>>> trans = Transformer.from_pipeline("+init=ITRF2000:ITRF93")
>>> trans.transform(-117.61748, 59.4967, 329.396)
(-111.83893294174032, 59.90053033616967, 330.56817290107665)

Then I used the `cct` tool and it seems to be slightly different:
$ cct --version
cct: Rel. 6.1.0, September 1st, 2019
$ cct +init=ITRF2000:ITRF93
-117.61748, 59.4967, 329.396
    -117.6048        59.5032      329.3751           inf

Do you have a result you are expecting?
Alan

None of the above make sense (not sure why you don't get the same result as 
pyproj as with cct. You must perform some additional conversion: unit ?). For 
transformations between ITRF realizations, the difference between the input 
and output coordinates should be very small (typically of the order of one 
metre or less, ie in the range of 1e-6 to 1e-5 degree)

The +init=ITRF2000:ITRF93 definition uses a +proj=helmert operation which 
operates in the cartesian/geocentric coordinate space. So you need to convert 
from geographic to geocentric coordinates first.

$ echo "-117.61748, 59.4967, 329.396" | src/cct -d 7 +proj=pipeline \
  +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad \
  +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 \
  +step +init=ITRF2000:ITRF93 \
  +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 \
  +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg

 -117.6174799     59.4967002   329.3845529           inf

Note also that being a time-dependent operation, you should generally supply 
the observation time as a 4th coordinate. If you do not do so, +proj=helmert 
will assume that the observation time is the same as the +t_epoch parameter, 
here 1988.

You can also get the same result with PROJ 6 using the EPSG dataset with:

echo "59.4967 -117.61748 329.396 1988" | src/cs2cs -f "%.7f" ITRF2000 ITRF93
59.4967002	-117.6174799 329.3845529 1988

ITRF2000 will resolve to EPSG:7909 (ITRF2000 Geographic3D CRS) and ITRF93 to 
EPSG:7905 (ITRF93 Geographic3D CRS).
Note the lat, long order due to using EPSG definitions.
The explicit 1988 here is needed since otherwise it would default to 0 (bug I 
just fixed in PROJ master / 6.1dev)

All,

Thanks for the feedback, this is super helpful!

I was definitely missing the conversion to geocentric coordinates. Note 
that the proj4 docs do actually have a discussion about using pipelines 
for exactly this purpose, which I neglected to see before submitting 
this question: https://proj4.org/usage/transformation.html

The only thing that I think needs to be changed in Even's example for my 
use case is the ellipsoid that is used. Instead of GRS80, my data are 
referenced to WGS84.

I will also adjust my input to use the observation time as the fourth 
parameter. Each of my observations does have a datetime associated with 
it, so that should be easy enough to do.

I'm going to do a bit more reading to ensure I understand each of these 
steps, but I think I have a better grasp now than I did!

Thanks again, this is much appreciated!

Trey

Thanks for the clarification Even, that helped make this much more clear. I
have much to learn!

It seems everything works properly in pyproj with the year added and
upgrading to the newest version of PROJ.
Just an update.
>>> from pyproj import Transformer

Testing the correct solution for this thread:
>>> proj_str = (
...     "+proj=pipeline "
...     "+step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad "
...     "+step +proj=cart +ellps=WGS84 "
...     "+step +init=ITRF2000:ITRF93 "
...     "+step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=WGS84 "
...     "+step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg"
... )
>>> trans = Transformer.from_pipeline(proj_str)
>>> trans.transform(-117.61748591770593, 59.496749040316935, 329.39612,
1988)
(-117.61748584159756, 59.49674923319888, 329.3846729239449, 1988.0)

Just testing the cs2cs functionality (needed to add support for ITRF
initialization in pyproj - PR for that submitted):
>>> crs_trans = Transformer.from_crs("ITRF2000", "ITRF93")
>>> crs_trans.transform(59.496749040316935, -117.61748591770593, 329.39612,
1988)
(59.49674923319888, -117.61748584159756, 329.3846729239449, 1988.0)

The updated version of the idea from earlier with strange results:
>>> trans = Transformer.from_pipeline("+init=ITRF2000:ITRF93")
>>> trans.transform(-117.61748591770593, 59.496749040316935, 329.39612, 0)
(-111.83893885919258, 59.900579376362764, 330.5682929011372, 0.0)
>>> trans.transform(-117.61748591770593, 59.496749040316935, 329.39612,
1988)
(-117.60478454066292, 59.50325042920626, 329.37522098600806, 1988.0)

Very informative thread.

Best,
Alan

that means we (developers) need to check with proj_angular_input() if such
a unit conversion is needed? AFAIU, units are now degrees as in EPSG:4326,
and in this case a conversion to radians is no longer required, as in
proj-4.

Excellent, thanks for the explanation and examples - it really helps
me understand the status of these repos.

Cheers, MIke.

I have prepared candidates for the upcoming releases of PROJ 6.1.0 and proj-datumgrid-europe-1.3.

Download the archives here:

https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-6.1.0RC1.tar.gz (https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-6.1.0RC1.tar.gz.md5)
https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-6.1.0RC1.zip (https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-6.1.0RC1.zip.md5)

https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-europe-1.3RC1.tar.gz
https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-europe-1.3RC1.zip


Please test the release candidates and report back any problems you may find. If no issues
are discovered I plan to call the vote for promotion to final release on Monday May 13th with
a targeted release date at May 15th.

The tests for the RDNAP datumgrid [0] still fail with 6.1.0-rc1.

The height values are exceed the allowed margin. See the attachment.

This is the biggest regression since PROJ 5.2.0 I've encountered.

>From the previous thread it seems to be a difficult problem without a clear
Solution. Looking at the test output though it seems as if the vertical shift
isn't  applied. Whether that is because of the issues discussed previously or
it is a problem in finding the naptrans2008.gtx grid on the system I can't
tell from the log file. 

The log file is also reporting that the epsg init file fails to load:

	pj_open_lib(epsg): call fopen(/usr/share/proj/epsg) - failed

So, is this simply an incorrect setting of PROJ_LIB or is it still the same
not so simple issue as reported previously?

This is expected, because the epsg init file no longer exist for PROJ 6.

The minimal epsg init file is also moved out of the way to prevent it 
from being used, this file was used with prior versions that only 
supporting a single path in PROJ_LIB.

It's probably the not so simple issue.

IIRC epsg:4258 is interpreted as a Geographic 2D CRS which likely causes 
the 3D component to be ignored.

The projinfo output is not something I can make sense of, it is as 
follows:

$ PROJ_LIB=.:/usr/share/proj projinfo -s EPSG:4258 -t rdnap:rdnap
target CRS: parsing of user string failed: crs not found

Yes, you should use EPSG:4937 (ETRS89 Geographic 3D CRS), but that will not 
solve the issue with the Z value. The issue here is that in the rdnap:rdnap 
string, the +geoidgrids=naptrans2008.gtx implies a transformation between 
WGS84 3D and the vertical CRS implied by naptrans2008.gtx. But you want to 
transform between ETRS89 3D and that vertical CRS. As there is no 
transformation registered in the EPSG dataset between WGS84 3D and ETRS89 3D 
(there is one only on the 2D part), PROJ cannot use the vertical grid

What works however is completely dropping the use of rdnap:rdnap and using 
EPSG:28992+5709 instead, that is "Amersfoort / RD New + NAP height", as there 
is a transformation registered between ETRS89 and NAP height, which uses the 
naptrans2008.gtx grid

$ echo "53.160753042 4.824761912 42.8614" | \
      PROJ_LIB=$PWD:data src/cs2cs -f "%.4f" EPSG:4937 EPSG:28992+5709
117380.1203	575040.3399 0.9985

Which is close to what you get with PROJ 5.2.0 with
cs2cs -r  -f %.4f +init=epsg:4258 +to +init=rdnap:rdnap:
117380.1203	575040.3398 1.0000

Note: you can use +init=rdnap:rdnap to resolved in the rdnap file.

Using epsg:4937 & epsg:28992+5709 doesn't fix the test failures, while 
the debug output is more extensive, I don't see naptrans2008.gtx being 
used, only rdtrans2008.gsb.

See the attachment.

Thanks for the tip. The syntax needs to be changed to include +type=crs 
I guess, because it still fails:

$ PROJ_LIB=.:/usr/share/proj projinfo -s EPSG:4258 -t +init=rdnap:rdnap
target CRS string is not a CRS

With the updated rdnap init file:

cat rdnap
# RDNAP with NTv2 and VDatum
<rdnap> +proj=sterea +lat_0=52.15616055555555 +lon_0=5.38763888888889 
+k=0.9999079 +x_0=155000 +y_0=463000 +ellps=bessel 
+nadgrids=rdtrans2008.gsb +geoidgrids=naptrans2008.gtx +units=m +no_defs 
+type=crs <>

# RD with NTv2 only
<rd> +proj=sterea +lat_0=52.15616055555555 +lon_0=5.38763888888889 
+k=0.9999079 +x_0=155000 +y_0=463000 +ellps=bessel 
+nadgrids=rdtrans2008.gsb +units=m +no_defs +type=crs <>

We indeed do get results:

$ PROJ_LIB=.:/usr/share/proj projinfo -s EPSG:4258 -t +init=rdnap:rdnap 
| head -8
Candidate operations found: 1
-------------------------------------
Operation n°1:

unknown id, unknown + unknown to WGS84 + Inverse of ETRS89 to WGS 84 (1) 
+ Transformation from unknown to ETRS89 (ballpark vertical 
transformation, without ellipsoid height to vertical height correction), 
unknown accuracy, Europe - ETRS89, has ballpark transformation

PROJ string:
+proj=pipeline +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +proj=unitconvert 
+xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +inv +proj=hgridshift 
+grids=rdtrans2008.gsb +step +proj=sterea +lat_0=52.1561605555556

+ellps=bessel


That leads to the question: How backwards compatible is +type=crs?

I've prepared a fix in https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1454 for that 
particular case (it turns out that something in the monster I created still 
manages to use the 2D ETRS89<-->WGS84 transformation):

$ src/projinfo -s EPSG:4937 -t "+proj=sterea +lat_0=52.15616055555555 
+lon_0=5.38763888888889 +k=0.9999079 +x_0=155000 +y_0=463000 +ellps=bessel 
+nadgrids=rdtrans2008.gsb +geoidgrids=naptrans2008.gtx +units=m +type=crs 
+no_defs" -o PROJ

Candidate operations found: 1
-------------------------------------
Operation n°1:

unknown id, unknown + unknown to WGS84 + Inverse of ETRS89 to WGS 84 (1) + 
unknown to WGS84 ellipsoidal height + Inverse of ETRS89 to WGS 84 (1), unknown 
accuracy, Europe - ETRS89, at least one grid missing

PROJ string:
+proj=pipeline +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step 
+proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +inv +proj=vgridshift +grids=naptrans2008.gtx 
+multiplier=1 +step +inv +proj=hgridshift +grids=rdtrans2008.gsb +step 
+proj=sterea +lat_0=52.1561605555556 +lon_0=5.38763888888889 +k=0.9999079 
+x_0=155000 +y_0=463000 +ellps=bessel

So both grids are used.

OK, I see in the log that you use
Exec:   cs2cs -r +init=epsg:4937 +to +init=epsg:28992+5709 -f %.4f

Just try (without the -r flag and the +init=epsg: prefixes):
cs2cs EPSG:4937 EPSG:28992+5709 -f %.4f

using the +init=epsg: syntax will go in a compatibility mode where the CRS 
will be expanded as a PROJ string as was done in the past, and thus you loose  
information about datums.

> Thanks for the tip. The syntax needs to be changed to include +type=crs

Yes, you need to add +type=crs to disambiguish the case where PROJ strings 
express CRS or coordinate operations

> That leads to the question: How backwards compatible is +type=crs?

Older PROJ versions should happily ignore it.

This change should have no impact when using EPSG:28992+5709 instead of 
+init=rdnap:rdnap, right?

Removing the cs2cs args and +init= prefix result in the gtx being used, 
but the magin is still too large.

See the attachment.

Thanks for the clarification. For now I've updated the test script to 
use EPSG:28992+5709 instead of +init=rdnap:rdnap, using the latter only 
for PROJ < 6.

ok, so this is on

Test:   10 edge_rd
Exec:   cs2cs EPSG:28992+5709 +to EPSG:4937 -f %.9f
Input:  50000.4500 335999.6700
[...]
Output: 51.003976841	3.891248343 44.739810857
Expect: 51.003976532	3.891247830
Latitude exceeds 1e-08 degrees: 3.08999993592352e-07
Longitude exceeds 1e-08 degrees: 5.12999999813246e-07

With proj 5.2.0:
$ echo "50000.4500 335999.6700" | ~/proj/install-proj-5.2.0/bin/cs2cs  
+init=rdnap:rdnap +to +init=epsg:4258 -f %.9f
3.891248343	51.003976842 44.740002097

And with proj master/6.1
$ echo "50000.4500 335999.6700" | PROJ_LIB=$PWD:data src/cs2cs EPSG:28992+5709 
+to EPSG:4937 -f %.9f
51.003976841	3.891248343 44.739810857

So for lat,long I get almost the same values with both PROJ versions (1e-9 deg 
difference on latitude). Perhaps the test expected result should be updated ?

Tests 07 - 10 are already handled differently, the "Use of RDTRANS2008 
and NAPTRANS2008.pdf" [0] documents the following:

"
    Points 07 - 10 are outside the region where interpolation between
    either the NLGEO2004 geoid or the RD correction grid points is
    possible. RD is defined only within the region enclosed by the
    following points (in RD), outside this region RD coordinates can
    be computed, but the output should be handled with care.

    Corners of the validity region for RD:
    ┌────────┬────────┐
    │  x (m) │  y (m) │
    ├────────┼────────┤
    │ 140000 │ 630000 │
    │ 100000 │ 600000 │
    │  80000 │ 500000 │
    │  -8000 │ 390000 │
    │  -8000 │ 335000 │
    │ 100000 │ 335000 │
    │ 160000 │ 288000 │
    │ 220000 │ 288000 │
    │ 301000 │ 450000 │
    │ 301000 │ 615000 │
    │ 260000 │ 630000 │
    └────────┴────────┘
"

The other tests (01 - 06) should all pass with values within the allowed 
margin of those expected.

Appendix 2 of the PDF documents the following:

"
  The transformation between ETRS89 and RD/NAP procedure should be tested 
in both directions. The
  rdtrans2008.gsb consists of one parent grid and one child grid, the 
naptrans2008.gtx consists of one
  grid, the bounding boxes of the grids, in Bessel-1841 geographic 
coordinates, are given by:

                      NTv2-parent grid  NTv2-child grid  VDatum-grid
  Latitude Minimum    50° 30’ 00.000”   50° 30’ 00.000”  50° 30’ 00.000”
  Latitude Maximum    55° 50’ 00.000”   54° 00’ 00.000”  55° 50’ 00.000”
  Latitude Interval   00° 05’ 00.000”   00° 00’ 30.000”  00° 00’ 30.000”
  Longitude Minimum   02° 30’ 00.000”   03° 00’ 00.000”  02° 30’ 00.000”
  Longitude Maximum   07° 40’ 00.000”   07° 40’ 00.000”  07° 40’ 00.000”
  Longitude Interval  00° 05’ 00.000”   00° 00’ 30.000”  00° 01’ 00.000”

  The coordinates below are computed with the RDNAPTRANSTM2008. the 
differences when using the
  rdtrans2008.gsb and naptrans2008.gtx grids should not exceed, except 
for point 10 (see limitation 2)
  of the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid):

  RD x and y coordinates:                      0.001 meters
  NAP heights and ETRS89 ellipsoidal heights:  0.001 meters
  ETRS89 latitude and longitude:               0.00000001 degrees
"

This margin was not exceeded with PROJ 5.2.0 (for tests 01 - 06).

For comparison, see the output of the test script for 5.2.0 & 6.1.0rc1
in the attachments.

...OK, I didn't realize that the failures where not necessarily at the end of the log file...

I will save you the details and headaches, but the gist of the issue was that the vertical transformation
and horizontal transformation where applied in the wrong order.
There were 2 separate causes:
- the EPSG dataset doesn't register the interpolationCRS for "ETRS89 to NAP height (1)" vertical transformation (naptrans2008.gtx).
  According to the PDF you provided, this must be the Amersfoort datum. As this information is missing, the code assumes that
  the horizontal CRS to use for vertical transformation is ETRS89.
- The code didn't take properly into account the interpolationCRS for such geog3D <--> compoundCRS transformations

I've addressed both issues by the followup commit
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1454/commits/ae16cff6877a39903cd049491fbb1d96a4149a96
of

With that I now get

(instead of the custom compoundCRS "EPSG:28992+5709", you can equivalently use the registered compoundCRS of the EPSG database "EPSG:7415")

PROJ will indeed detect that the point is outside of the RD grid, and then it will use
the EPSG:15739 "Amersfoort to ETRS89 (3)" Helmert-based transformation.

I'm not sure how they get their expected result. It should be noted that proj 5.2.0 fails to transform in that case:

OK, I just submitted a change request to EPSG for that. But I then realized 
that currently the EPSG database itself doesn't even have a column for the 
interpolationCRS. This is a PROJ-only addition when I aligned the database 
model on ISO-19111. So I guess that the manual patching I did will remain for 
some time until EPSG upgrades their data model.

Like test 10 edge_rd, there are coordinates in the output, but exceeding
the margin is ignored to allow the test to succeed. Because as the PDF
documents: "... outside this region RD coordinates can be computed, but
the output should be handled with care.". I don't consider this
indications of issues in proj unlike the failures of the tests within
the RD region. Many thanks for fixing those!

I've added a patch with the changes from #1454 to the proj Debian
package, and with that all the tests succeed again.

Once Travis is happy about the changes, those changes will be included
in RC2?

Kind Regards,

Bas

So is this a -1 on this change? I'm conscious the deadline is closing
for 6.1....

At the moment I'm wondering if I'll need to just resort to a regex to
get this property (argh!) as I'd need that as a fallback for proj 6.0
in any case.

I'm indifferent. Was mostly to bring that to the attention of Kristian.

In an ideal world, QGIS should avoid messing directly with PROJ strings (I 
guess this is for some backward compatibility reason regarding QGIS API). 
Especially regarding extracting elements from them. Treating the whole string 
as an opaque string might be acceptable, although not the most precise 
representation compared to using WKT or directly the EPSG:XXXX representation 
when available (I know I repeat myself on this, but this is for the education 
of the crowds :-))

Subject: [PROJ] Possible error with +datum=potsdam and PROJ >= 5.0.0
Message-ID: <1557232576.8574.31.camel@mondula.com>

Hi,

we noticed differences in transforming geographic data from EPSG:31468
to WGS 84 using ST_Transform on different PostGIS installations and it
seems to come from different PROJ versions. 

For example, we have a point from CAD drawings of the Nuremberg subway
network with the coordinates 4435877.4477166822 5475816.0547993957, so
we know it must be on the train tracks.

Converting this point using PROJ 4.9.3 gives us this point [1] with the
coordinates 11.1148165905971 49.4159011654427 and using PROJ 5.0.1
gives us this point [2] with the coordinates 11.1161576118633
49.4169712194789. However, updating the proj4text in the
spatial_ref_sys table for the srid 31468 from 

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=12 +k=1 +x_0=4500000 +y_0=0 +datum=potsdam
+units=m +no_defs

to

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=12 +k=1 +x_0=4500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=bessel 
on the PostGIS installation with version 5.0.1 of PROJ again gives
correct results.

PROJ version >= 5.0.0 seems to incorrectly handle conversions using
+datum=potsdam. From [3] one can download test data to verify correct
conversion from DHDN / GK to ETRS89 / UTM. Testing conversion of the
value in line 7 of the downloadable CSV file [4] the results for PROJ
version 4.9.3 and versions >= 5.0.0 differ. I have executed the
following command using PROJ versions 4.9.3, 5.0.0, 5.1.0, and 6.0.0

echo 4395886.918912 5819485.694352 | cs2cs +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0
+lon_0=12 +k=1 +x_0=4500000 +y_0=0 +datum=potsdam +units=m +no_defs +to
+init=epsg:25832

The output for 4.9.3 is:

599474.76	5817502.61 42.57

The output for the other versions is:

599559.03	5817663.04 0.00

Is this a bug in PROJ? And if so, what would be the recommended
workaround?

Kind Regards,


Alexander Njemz

Thanks :-) I am of the opinion that we should avoid incompatible changes for
this release. When suggested adding more to PJ_PROJ_INFO I didn’t realize
that it would affect the ABI.

In addition, after having giving this some more though I think there must be a
better way to deal with this problem. A generic function that can returns all
parameters that make up a PJ object would be preferable. A wrapper for
pj_param() would do the trick but a better way likely exists.

I will save you the details and headaches, but the gist of the issue was that the vertical transformation
and horizontal transformation where applied in the wrong order.
There were 2 separate causes:
- the EPSG dataset doesn't register the interpolationCRS for "ETRS89 to NAP height (1)" vertical transformation (naptrans2008.gtx).
 According to the PDF you provided, this must be the Amersfoort datum. As this information is missing, the code assumes that
 the horizontal CRS to use for vertical transformation is ETRS89.
- The code didn't take properly into account the interpolationCRS for such geog3D <--> compoundCRS transformations

I've addressed both issues by the followup commit
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1454/commits/ae16cff6877a39903cd049491fbb1d96a4149a96

(instead of the custom compoundCRS "EPSG:28992+5709", you can equivalently use the registered compoundCRS of the EPSG database "EPSG:7415")

That has become quite an impressive PR, thanks!

PROJ will indeed detect that the point is outside of the RD grid, and then it will use
the EPSG:15739 "Amersfoort to ETRS89 (3)" Helmert-based transformation.

I'm not sure how they get their expected result. It should be noted that proj 5.2.0 fails to transform in that case:

Like test 10 edge_rd, there are coordinates in the output, but exceeding
the margin is ignored to allow the test to succeed. Because as the PDF
documents: "... outside this region RD coordinates can be computed, but
the output should be handled with care.". I don't consider this
indications of issues in proj unlike the failures of the tests within
the RD region. Many thanks for fixing those!

I've added a patch with the changes from #1454 to the proj Debian
package, and with that all the tests succeed again.

Once Travis is happy about the changes, those changes will be included
in RC2?

Yes, Even merged the PR earlier today. I’ll release RC2 later today.

An array of OperationParameterValue provided by
SingleOperation.parameterValue method? (ISO 19111 figure 16). I do not
know if PROJ6 already implements those classes, but that would be an ISO
approach if PROJ wishes to continue that path.

Alexander,

In PROJ 4.9.3 and earlier, +datum=potsdam expanded to 
+ellps=bessel +towgs84=598.1,73.7,418.2,0.202,0.045,-2.455,6.7

In PROJ 5.0.0 and later, +datum=postdam was changed to expand to
+ellps=bessel +nadgrids=@BETA2007.gsb

That is it will use the more precise BETA2007.gsb grid rather than the towgs84 
clause, but this require the grid to be installed alongside other PROJ grids. 
If not present, then no datum shift is done, hence the result you see.

So with PROJ 5.0.0 and later, you could get the same result as PROJ 4.9.3 if 
you don't have the grid installed, by replacing "+datum=potsdam" with
"+ellps=bessel +towgs84=598.1,73.7,418.2,0.202,0.045,-2.455,6.7"
(I don't understand why you'd get a correct result with just +ellps=bessel 
without a +towgs84 or +nadgrids. That doesn't make sense to me)

With proj 5.2.0

$ echo "4395886.918912 5819485.694352" | cs2cs -f "%.4f" +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 
+lon_0=12 +k=1 +x_0=4500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=bessel 
+towgs84=598.1,73.7,418.2,0.202,0.045,-2.455,6.7 +to +init=epsg:25832
599474.7609	5817502.6096 42.5689

With proj 6, things will work transparently:

- with BETA2007.gdb installed, you get exactly the result from the .csv file:

$ echo "4395886.918912 5819485.694352" | cs2cs -f "%.4f" EPSG:31464 EPSG:25832
599474.9342	5817502.6270 0.0000

- without it installed, it fallbacks to the Helmert transformation

$ echo "4395886.918912 5819485.694352" | cs2cs -f "%.4f" EPSG:31464 EPSG:25832
599474.7609	5817502.6096 0.0000

Actually, I realize there must be something fishy with your PROJ installation. 
The BETA2007.gsb grid is part of the
https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.8.zip package which is 
normally installed together with PROJ with usual binary distributions, so the 
changed to expanding to +nadgrids=@BETA2007.gsb was reasonable.
If you compile PROJ from source, you must unzip its content in
${proj_install_prefix}/share/proj

Subject: [PROJ] Projection for Sandwell et al.'s topex topo and grav files?
Message-ID: <CACmBxytj1pE5wWTXLYctJoRuYV8KLOZZWtqp=bgphoRkmvz2og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I figured I should ask here too if anyone know what the correct projection
is for the Sandwell .img grids from http://topex.ucsd.edu.  I'm trying to
keep the files in their original projections as I switch them to geotiffs.
I've asked David Sandwell directly too if he knows.

This works, but warps the data first:

gmt img2grd -V -R-180/180/-80/80 topo_18.1.img  -Gtest2.grd -T1 -D
gdal_translate -a_srs EPSG:4326 test2.grd test2.tif
gdalinfo test2.tif  # Results look believable
gdal_translate topo-18-1-epsg4326.tif topo-18-1-epsg4326-deflate.tif -co
COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co PREDICTOR=3

Then imported into QGIS or Earth Engine as a normal user, things line up
pretty well.

    https://code.earthengine.google.com/f43c8b13bafa26fd8c7f83ce9a919f6e


I'd rather do it more like this:

gmt img2grd -V -R-180/180/-80/80 topo_18.1.img
-Gspherical-mercator-proj.grd -T1 -D -M
img2grd: Expects topo_18.1.img to be 21600 by 17280 pixels spanning
0/360.0/-80.738009/80.738009.
img2grd: To fit [averaged] input, your topo_18.1.img is adjusted to
-R-180/180/-80.0023237126/80.0023237126.
img2grd: The output grid size will be 21600 by 16752 pixels.
img2grd: Created 21600 by 16752 Mercatorized grid file.  Min, Max values
are -10914  8550

gives this which doesn't work as is:

gdalinfo spherical-mercator-proj.grd
Driver: netCDF/Network Common Data Format
Files: spherical-mercator-proj.grd
Size is 21600, 16752
Coordinate System is `'

Pixel Size = (0.016666666666667,-0.016666666666667)

Should I be using one of 54004 or 41001?  e.g.

The IMG grids are spherical Mercator inches so there is likely no EPSG or WKT that represents that. But you can do all the work in GMT.

 

1- Convert to netcdf, maintaining the Merc projection, but change the origin to (0,0) (it was in the LL corner). That’s the role of -C

 

img2grd -R-180/180/-80/80 topo_19.1.img -Gspherical-mercator-proj.grd -T1 -D -M -C

 

2- Edit the header to convert the inches to Mercator meters. The grid above has x_min = -180; x_max = 180.

And that corresponds to 6378137 *2pi = 4.007501668557849e7  meters. So we can compute a scale factor of 

 

111319.49079327358 = 6378137 *2pi / 360

 

and apply it to the region in degrees.

 

[-180 180 -139.6 139.6] .* 111319.49079327358 = -20037508.3427892 20037508.3427892 -15540200.914741 15540200.914741

 

So finaly use grdedit to change the limits and assign it a proj4 string describing the projection

 

grdedit spherical-mercator-proj.grd -R-20037508.3427892/20037508.3427892/-15540200.914741/15540200.914741 -J"+proj=merc +lon_0=0 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +units=m +no_defs"

 

You can now confirm with gdalinfo

 

C:\v>gdalinfo spherical-mercator-proj.grd

the following C code snippet raises an unexpected exception:

PJ *p1;
PJ *p2;
PJ_CONTEXT *ctx = proj_create_context();
p1 = proj_create_crs_to_crs(ctx, "EPSG:4326", "EPSG:3003", NULL);
p2 = proj_normalize_for_visualization(ctx, p1);

proj_normalize_for_visualization:
Object is not a CoordinateOperation created with proj_create_crs_to_crs

Yes, this is a bug.
I've prepared a fix for it in

Ok, thank you. That makes a lot of sense. It is a little unfortunate
that there is no warning or anything when BETA2007.gsb is not
available. 

I was using a PostGIS Docker image based on Alpine Linux and indeed,
the grid file is not there. I will try to contact the maintainer of the
PROJ package for Alpine Linux, and ask him if he could update the
package. 

Thanks again.

Best,

All

That also means we will have an RC3. I’ll try to find the time to put it up tomorrow,
otherwise early on Friday. I would really like that one to be the last RC, so if you 
haven’t tested RC2 yet please do so and report any issues you find.

I'm really sorry, but I've found a further issue.
proj_normalize_for_visualization crashes on default context:

PJ *p1;
PJ *p2;
p1 = proj_create_crs_to_crs(NULL, "EPSG:4326", "EPSG:3003", NULL);
p2 = proj_normalize_for_visualization(NULL, p1);

and this is what Valgrind reports:

Thanks!  I'll be investigating more today.  Monica Schwehr mentioned that
you have a different Earth radius than she was seeing in the GMT code
base.  I'll follow up on that after I get a chance to look through GMT head
and GMT 4 more.

Kristian,

I've also just added the Belgian bd72lb72_etrs89lb08.gsb grid per
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid/pull/50, so ideally proj-datumgrid-
europe should be recreated.

Yeah, I just noticed. I’ll make sure to add an RC2 of the Europe grid package.

Right, I used a radius from a proj4 string that I had here but I'm
realizing that 6378137 is WGS's 84 major axis. OK, I should have used the
proj
 sphere a=6370997.0
(or the GMT's 6371008.7714, but that would make no difference as long as we
calculate the scale factor with one and use that same one in the proj
string)
With it, and recomputing the scale factor, you should use

grdedit spherical-mercator-proj.grd
-R-20015077.3712426/20015077.3712426/-15522804.4501415/15522804.4501415
-J"+proj=merc +lon_0=0 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6370997 +b=6370997 +units=m
+no_defs"

However, I realized that grdedit is doing something to the limits that I
need to understand better. See that it slightly changed the XX limits that
we provided. x_min & x_max are no longer symetric, but y_min,max are.

Thanks Joaquim.

I'll see if I can get that in and visualized.  I'm having a challenge with
alignment with a hill shaded background.

Life is extra fun that src/Ellipsoids.txt was replace by by
gmt_ellipsoids.h back in January:

git log --all --full-history -- src/Ellipsoids.txt

I think I'm able to trace what is going on:

./src/gmt_ellipsoids.h: {"Sphere", 1984, 6371008.7714, 0},

egrep 'Jm|Sphere|grdproject' src/img/img2grd.c
 * preserving the Mercator projection (gmtdefaults PROJ_ELLIPSOID = Sphere)
 * and height of the (spherical) Mercator map with -Rww/ee/ss/nn and -Jm1.

snprintf (Merc->header->x_units, GMT_GRID_UNIT_LEN80, "Spherical Mercator

Kurt, I’ll be away for a couple hours so cannot test this, but if the limits change in the grdedit step are wrong I suspect you can split into two steps:
1 change only the -R
2. Add the project info with the -J part.

Yes, this is a bug.
I've prepared a fix for it in
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1459

merged in master and backported to 6.1


All

That also means we will have an RC3. I’ll try to find the time to put it up tomorrow,
otherwise early on Friday. I would really like that one to be the last RC, so if you
haven’t tested RC2 yet please do so and report any issues you find.


I just tried to upload RC3 but unfortunately I get a “permission denied” message back
from download.osgeo.org<http://download.osgeo.org> so that isn’t happening now. It seems that the server has been
moved. Possibly my privileges hasn’t been migrated to the new server. Is someone in the
know about this?

I will try again tomorrow morning - hopefully it works without further complications.

After a few issues were found in PROJ 6.1.0RC2 I have now prepared a third release candidate. Grab it here:

https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-6.1.0RC3.tar.gz (https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-6.1.0RC3.tar.gz.md5)
https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-6.1.0RC3.zip (https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-6.1.0RC3.zip.md5)

A new release candidate for the proj-datumgrid-europe 1.3 package is also available:

https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-europe-1.3RC2.tar.gz
https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-europe-1.3RC2.zip

As always, please test the release candidates and report any issues you encounter.

Hi list

Still fighting with transitioning QGIS to proj 6. (Honestly, I wonder
if this task will ever end...!)

If I have a proj string (say +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs
+type=crs), how can I match this back to an authority/code from proj's
db?

proj_identify doesn't seem to be capable of this (maybe by design? The
dox say: "This is implemented for GeodeticCRS, ProjectedCRS,
VerticalCRS and CompoundCRS"). The dox for proj_identify also have a
cryptic note "The candidate CRSs are either hard-coded, or looked in
the database when authorityFactory is not null." What exactly does
this mean? I can't see where authorityFactory is specified, or a hard
coded list of candidates is specified either... Is this outdated
documentation?

You just hit a bug. The issue is that instanciating from PROJ string for a 
GeographicCRS like the above creates a long,lat coordinate system, whereas 
EPSG:4326 is lat,long. I've just fixed this in master and 6.1 branches by 
setting a flag to indicate that CRS identification must be axis order 
tolerant.

The later part is a copy&paste from the corresponding C++ which in clearer 
terms translate to "when the database is available". Also fixed.

What about the "hard-coded" part of the text? What exactly does this
mean? I can't see anyway to specify this list of hard-coded
candidates.

I've just tested with master, and I'm still struggling here.

PJ* crs = proj_create( 0, "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +type=crs")
if ( PJ_OBJ_LIST *crsList = proj_identify( 0, crs, nullptr, nullptr,
&confidence ) )
{
 // never reached, regardless of proj string
}

Should proj_identify work ok in this situation?

Hi list,

On proj master, running "projinfo EPSG:4164" results in the output (as
expected) of:

PROJ.4 string:
+proj=longlat +ellps=krass +towgs84=-76,-138,67,0,0,0,0 +no_defs +type=crs

Yet, running the code:

PJ* crs = proj_create_from_database( 0, "EPSG", "4164",
PJ_CATEGORY_CRS, false, nullptr );
const char* projstring = proj_as_proj_string( 0, crs, PJ_PROJ_4, nullptr);

results in "+proj=longlat +ellps=krass +no_defs +type=crs", with no
towgs84 param.

What am I missing here?

projinfo does indeed a little more work by calling  
proj_crs_create_bound_crs_to_WGS84() which makes en effort to retrieve a 
towgs84 clause when it is possible to add one (this one is defined in 
proj_experimental.h, which should rather be understood as "proj advanced") 
first.

Hum, works for me. Is PROJ_LIB properly set ?

No, it means that there are a few CRS whose definitions is hard coded and so 
identify() might be able to identiy them even if the database is not 
available. But you can ignore that implementation detail.

So should we always be calling proj_crs_create_bound_crs_to_WGS84 (if
I'm trying to get a proj string which matches the official
definition)? When would we *not* want to use this method?

Not sure if there's really an "official" definition, but if you want to 
approach past behaviour as much as possible, yes, you should use it. There 
should not be any disavantage with using it.
Note however that you will not always get the same results as before. See one 
of my recent exchange with Sandro Furieri about EPSG:3003

It should be noted that proj_identify does not filter by auth_name (I
raised an issue about that). Everything else works great 👍. So, if that
capability is not a deal breaker, should be fine to proceed with the
release.

I've just issued a pull request ( https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1466 ) 
to fix it.
I don't think that is a release blocker though. The bug was already in 6.0. 
There will always been known and unknown bugs in any release we issue...

A possible workaround is to export the CRS to identify as a PROJ string, 
create a new CRS object from it, and identify it by restricting to the EPSG 
authoriy name (of course you'll loose some information). Or a bit better, but 
more involved, export as WKT, remove the ID/AUTHORITY node, and identify.

Hi proj list,

I feel like it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge just how
helpful and responsive this list (and the proj development team) have
been to all my recent questions and confusions.

You've been fantastic, and have gone well and truly above any possible
expectations from an open-source community(*).

So, many many thanks for all your assistance and hard work on this
project. It's definitely noticed and appreciated!

All,

PROJ was recently accepted into the OSGeo incubation program [0]. The first task for the project is to fill out the incubation checklist. I've added it to the wiki on GitHub [1]. I have started filling it out myself but so far I have only made it through a third of it. I plan to finish this soon but should someone have the urge to step in and give a helping hand, please feel free.

There seams to have no difference between these lines in 6.0.0 and 6.10 sql files.
Any idea ?

Hi Didier,

I assume that you have run the tests with the RAF09.gtx file present and not 
the RAF18.gtx one ?
If so the failure is expected. 'make check' will run fine with just the 
default proj-datumgrid is installed, but the presence of other grids might 
cause changes in results. If the new grid RAF18.gtx from proj-datumgrid-
europe-1.3 is present, you'll get also a slightly different result. Nothing to 
worry about.

> RAF18.gtx is related to France mainland onshore while RAF09.gtx is related
> to French Antilla.

Hum, not according to the EPSG dataset... Both are registered against 
EPSG:1326 area of use 'France - mainland onshore'. Maybe you are confusing 
RAF09.gtx (the former version of RAF18.gtx) with RGAF09 which is indeed for 
French Antilla.

> 

The above entry dates back indeed to PROJ 6.0 / proj-datumgrid-europe-1.2 when 
there was only the RAF09.gtx grid available, and not RAF18. The removal of 
this deprecation entry doesn't hurt by itself, although it is no longer be 
necessary. So I've just removed it in master.

	possible? valid?
Message-ID: <CAB28Asj_JKhDKt_B+Pvx0G0bi7njUgQA1__ZXZN6gRVAUTm1HQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey list,

If I attempt to create a transform using proj_create_crs_to_crs, with
the source proj string "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs" and dest
proj string "+proj=longlat +a=2632345 +no_defs", I get the error
"internal_proj_create_operations: Source and target ellipsoid do not
belong to the same celestial body".

My question is -- should this be allowed? It worked ok in previous
proj versions, and it's a common situation in QGIS which I'm having
issues fixing after the v6 port.

Or is it violating some rule of transformation? How can I reproduce
the proj 4 behaviour here?

Cheers,
Nyall

Nyall,

This is basically the same question as you asked a few months ago:
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj/2019-March/008390.html

Not sure exactly what celestial body you are trying to map this time,
but the problem remains the same: WGS84 is a CRS belonging to Earth,
that can’t meaningfully be transformed to a CRS on another
planet/moon/asteroid/whatever.

You can convert between different ellipsoids but does it make sense when one
has a radius 3 times larger than the other? Anyway, here’s how:

echo 12 56 0 0 | cct +proj=pipeline +step +proj=cart +ellps=WGS84 +step +proj=cart +R=2632345 +inv
12.0000000000   55.8213634673  3731132.8860        0.0000

Notice the height of the original point flying 3700 km above the ground on
the new ellipsoid.

Can you explain in which scenarios you need to do the transformation
you are asking for? That might make it easier to advise you.

/Kristian

proj versions, and it's a common situation in QGIS which I'm having
issues fixing after the v6 port.

Or is it violating some rule of transformation? How can I reproduce
the proj 4 behaviour here?

Cheers,
Nyall

Not for real world use cases, but for some artificial unit cases, right ?

I think we discussed this before. Basically there's a new check that prevents 
doing non sensical transformations. No workaround than disabling the check in 
code

Thanks for the direction (not being sarcastic, you definitely pointed
fingers back at the non-proj code being at fault, which it was).  This
invalid transform was the result of some no-longer-correct assumptions
that crs objects can always be represented by a proj string or unique
auth/code combo.

Hi list,

Another one from me. Attempting to reproject from WGS84 to web mercator:

PJ* crs = proj_create_crs_to_crs( 0, "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84
+no_defs", "+proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0 +lon_0=0 +x_0=0
+y_0=0 +k=1 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +wktext +no_defs")
PK* res = proj_normalize_for_visualization( 0, crs );

Throws an error -61 when trying to reproject the coordinate -68.2 /
70.8 using res.

What am I missing?

Hi list,

I see quite a lot of "IAU2000" CRS definitions on
https://www.spatialreference.org/ref/?page=4&search=iau which are not
available in the proj database.

Is there any plans to integrate these systems into proj?

As part of this past thread
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/PROJ-Proj-6-API-questions-td5398663i20.html
Trent Hare from USGS replied they were working to integrate IAU2000 codes
(but the message probably didn't reach the list if he's not subscribed)

Works for me:

#include "proj.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    PJ* crs = proj_create_crs_to_crs( 0,
        "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs",

+k=1 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +wktext +no_defs",
        0);
    PJ* res = proj_normalize_for_visualization( 0, crs );
    PJ_COORD c;
    c.xyz.x = -68.2;
    c.xyz.y = 70.8;
    c.xyz.z = 0;
    c =  proj_trans(res, PJ_FWD, c);
    printf("%f %f\n", c.xy.x, c.xy.y);

Yann,


*>>What is the status of IAU integration in GDAL?  *
  Not much to update. I have been busy with supporting PDS (and learning
PDS4). Even has created a great start for both a raster and vector/table PDS4
driver in GDAL <https://www.gdal.org/frmt_pds4.html>. And also busy
supporting a camera model environment
<https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/planetdata2019/pdf/7019.pdf> based on
the CSM API (to be presented at the upcoming 4th Planetary Data Workshop
<https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/planetdata2019/>).

Anyway, paths forward for IAU integration into GDAL. All of which I could
use help with.

(1) validate major update to "create_IAU2000.py
<https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/GDAL_scripts/blob/master/OGC_IAU2000_WKT_v2/Source_Python/create_IAU2000.py>"
(by J-Christophe) and re-release WKT projection files to GitHub. This is a
script to take the IAU published radius values and create the WTK
projection files (per IAU-code) and initFile for proj4 can be created. We
had to clarify the use of Reference_Meridian = 0.0 for both WKT1 and WKT2.
You can wade through this confusing issue here:
https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/GDAL_scripts/issues/34  . That should
be *all resolved* in the latest version of the Python script and we can now
move forward.

(2) Update script to create for what GDAL needs. Here is what is required
(email from Even),
"""
Just provide the data as .sql scripts to be inserted in the database in
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/tree/master/data/sql

Either manually, or through an import script that generates them from other
sources, like done for:
- EPSG: https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/scripts/build_db.py
- ESRI:
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/scripts/build_db_from_esri.py
- IGNF:
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/scripts/build_db_create_ignf_from_xml.py

The database schema is in:
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/data/sql/proj_db_table_defs.sql

"""

(3. longer-term). Lastly, I'm not sure what to do with spatialreference.org.
I keep hearing it has been deprecated, so no updates, but it keeps hanging
around. :-). If we need a new registry we can help stand something up (or
maybe just use Github?). But, I would still like our codes to head over to
the OGC CRS resolver (not sure the status for that effort though) - see:
http://external.opengeospatial.org/twiki_public/CRSdefinitionResolver  But
... by forcing the date in the name (e.g. IAU2000, IAU2015), I sort-of
messed up RESTful "versioning" which should look more like (for Mars 49900
using the 2000 report would be something like "/def/crs/IAU/2000/49900"
*not* "/def/crs/IAU2000/49900"). I guess for the resolver website we could
just split the IAU and year...?

I would love to see progress made on this front - so again, I would welcome
the help!

thanks,
Trent

Also, as a reminder, J-Christophe, also has a fork of Mapserver (on his
github site) with IAU projection code support. We need to test that too (as
have used Mapserver for years
<http://planetarygis.blogspot.com/2014/09/tips-to-interact-with-astros-wms-maps.html>
and
embarrassingly default to EPSG:4326! Fortunately degrees are degrees but
not a good precedence for us to use all these years).

Subject: [PROJ] Newbie question on projections
Message-ID: <25df1c24-4be9-e466-2b54-2e0c0aac1e0f@gmail.com>

I have a project that takes spherical maps (either Terrestrial or 
astronomical) as its input. The inputted data is stored in a "flat" 
360x180 (scaled up or down depending upon the resolution) 2-D array. As 
an early step in the process I then display the map in one of the basic 
projections (currently Mollweide, but I would like to support others). I 
am hoping that I can use PROJ4 to transform this into another 2-D array 
that can then be passed into the display routines.

 1. Is this something that PROJ4 can do?
 2. If so, can this capability be called as a library function from
    within the program?
 3. If not, is there another library I should consider to support this need?

Thank you for your help with this.

Proj will convert double arrays of longitude/latitudes into Mollweide, if that’s the question? It’ll also convert into a whole zoo of other interesting global projections, if you’re looking for alternatives. It can be called as a library https://proj4.org/development/quickstart.html <https://proj4.org/development/quickstart.html>

Depending on your end goal, I would recommend using GDAL to reproject 2D
data. This will resample your data from a 2D grid in one projection to a 2D
grid in a new projection.
https://www.gdal.org/gdalwarp.html

If you are a Python user, I would recommend:
https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/html/examples/reproject.html
https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/reproject.html

Hopefully this helps,
Alan

This was a silly error on my part -- I had some extra test code in
between creation of the crs and the proj_trans call which was raising
an error, and I'd omitted a call to proj_errno_reset to clear the
error afterwards. So the -61 error was actually coming from the
earlier call, and not the proj_trans one.

Hi list,

So, I think I'm finally onto the last piece of the QGIS proj 4 -> 6
puzzle. I think I've got the way forward here, but I'm after
confirmation that this is the right path to take.

The situation is:

- In current QGIS versions (proj 4 builds), a custom table of datum
transforms exists. This table maps src -> dest crs pairs via a
corresponding grid shift file. E.g. 4283 -> 7844 has entries for
GDA94_GDA2020_conformal_and_distortion.gsb and
GDA94_GDA2020_conformal.gsb.

- There's potentially multiple rows in this table per src/dest pair,
representing each of the different paths for transforming between
these systems

- Depending on users settings, either the "best" (an extremely loose
definition - basically the first non-deprecated path!) is selected
from this table when first transforming between a pair of systems, OR
users are shown a dialog listing all available pathways and they can
make a manual selection from these. (Settings are stored in projects,
with an option to save as the default choice on a particular install).

- This transformation is used for all future operations between those
two coordinate systems in that project

Now, obviously under proj 6 we want to dump all that, and use proj 6's
(far) superior intelligence and db to handle this. I would still like
to be able to (optionally) present users with a list of possible
transformation pathways which they can select from though.

Currently, I'm thinking of doing this by:

- Using proj_create_operations to obtain a list of the possible
transforms between a source/dest reference system

- Either using proj_get_name or proj_as_wkt as a way to represent
these transforms and present them to users (or is there a nicer
approach? The names I've encountered tend to be vague, e.g. "Inverse
of Vicgrid + GDA94 to GDA2020 (1) + Vicgrid"/"Inverse of Vicgrid +
GDA94 to GDA2020 (2) + Vicgrid", yet the wkt string is overly lengthy
and complex for most users).

- I'll use proj_coordoperation_get_accuracy as a way of showing users
the accuracy of the operations, and proj_is_deprecated to highlight
deprecated ones.

- I'll use proj_operation_factory_context_set_grid_availability_use
with either PROJ_GRID_AVAILABILITY_IGNORED or
PROJ_GRID_AVAILABILITY_USED_FOR_SORTING so that users can see
transforms which they are missing the grids for, and highlight these
differently in the gui (and block their use)

- I'll confirm grid availability using
proj_coordoperation_is_instantiable, and
proj_coordoperation_get_grid_used in order to show the grid details
(and download url) to users

- After users have selected their desired pipeline, I'll store the
WKT2 2018 representation of this. For future transformations between
that pair of coordinate systems (inside that project), I'll use
proj_create with the stored wkt2 string to create a transformation
using the desired pathway.

Questions:

- Does this approach seem reasonable? Is there anything I'm
misunderstanding, or better ways I could approach this?

- I never seem to obtain any deprecated results using
proj_create_operations -- are these filtered in the operation factory
context by default? If so, is there a way to enable them?

- From my tests it looks fine, but I'd love double-confirmation that
this approach will correctly handle transformations which require
pivots, such as Vicgrid GDA94 -> Vicgrid GDA2020.

Many thanks!
Nyall

No better suggestion.

You'll never get deprecated coordinate operations when using 
proj_create_operations(). They are automatically removed (deprecated == broken 
in EPSG terms. Which is different from superseded). You can only get 
deprecated objects by querying them explicitly by code.

Storing the PROJ string would also be reasonable (PROJ strings for coordinate 
operations are lossless for the purpose of transforming coordinates), but the 
WKT2 2018 representation will give you a more traceable way. That said, I will 
not guarantee at 100% that the WKT2 2018 representation of the whole pipeline 
can be roundtripped in all situations, so I'd suggest perhaps:

1) export the coord op as PROJ string
2) export the coord op as WKT2_2018 and instanciate it as a PJ with 
proj_create()
3) export the PJ of 2) as PROJ string, and compare (string equality) with 1). 
If they match you can use the WKT2_2018 just fine. Otherwise use the PROJ 
string of 1) (and report such cases so that we can check if that can be 
improved)

See above. Removal of them is hardcoded.

Sounds good.

Ok, makes sense. I'll remove that filter and checkbox for proj 6 builds.

Reading this sounds like I'm best off just to use the proj strings and
be done with it. But I was under the impression that not all CRSes
could be represented as a proj string? (e.g. EPSG:2218). Is it still
possible to represent operations from crses like EPS:2218 to proj
strings with loss?

I'm seeing something I can't explain here.

Using this code to list operations from EPSG:3111 to EPSG:7899, I see
(as expected) 3 results, all using GDA94->GDA2020 as a pivot:

  PJ *crs1 = proj_create_from_database( pjContext, "EPSG", "3111",
PJ_CATEGORY_CRS, false, nullptr );
  PJ *crs2 = proj_create_from_database( pjContext, "EPSG", "7899",
PJ_CATEGORY_CRS, false, nullptr );
  PJ_OPERATION_FACTORY_CONTEXT *operationContext =
proj_create_operation_factory_context( pjContext, nullptr );
  proj_operation_factory_context_set_grid_availability_use( pjContext,
operationContext, PROJ_GRID_AVAILABILITY_IGNORED );
  PJ_OBJ_LIST *ops = proj_create_operations( pjContext, crs1, crs2,
operationContext );

Results in:

Inverse of Vicgrid + GDA94 to GDA2020 (1) + Vicgrid
+proj=pipeline +step +inv +proj=lcc +lat_0=-37 +lon_0=145 +lat_1=-36

Inverse of Vicgrid + GDA94 to GDA2020 (3) + Vicgrid
+proj=pipeline +step +inv +proj=lcc +lat_0=-37 +lon_0=145 +lat_1=-36

+lat_0=-37 +lon_0=145 +lat_1=-36 +lat_2=-38 +x_0=2500000 +y_0=2500000
+ellps=GRS80

BUT... listing operations directly from GDA94 (EPSG:4283) to GDA2020
(EPSG:7844) only gives one result:

GDA94 to GDA2020 (1)
+proj=pipeline +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +proj=unitconvert
+xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +proj=push +v_3 +step +proj=cart
+ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=helmert +x=0.06155 +y=-0.01087 +z=-0.04019

+convention=coordinate_frame +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step
+proj=pop +v_3 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg +step
+proj=axisswap +order=2,1

Why aren't the options using using the
GDA94_GDA2020_conformal_and_distoration.gsb and
GDA94_GDA2020_conformal.gsb listed here?

And as a follow up question -- when checking the accuracy of the 3
pipelines given from EPSG:3111 to EPSG:7899,
proj_coordoperation_get_accuracy reports that the transforms using the
grid shift files only have an accuracy of 0.05m, vs 0.01m for the
non-grid pipeline (counter to my expectations). How is this accuracy
derived?

PROJ strings can accurately represent coordinate operations (even between CRS 
that can't be themselves losslessly represented as PROJ strings).

Because you don't use 

proj_operation_factory_context_set_spatial_criterion(pjContext, 
operationContext,
PROJ_SPATIAL_CRITERION_PARTIAL_INTERSECTION)

hint: if you had tried with projinfo, it would have advised you about that ;-)

The reason is that for EPSG:3111 to EPSG:7899, the area of use is "small", so
there are 3 possible datum shift operations whose area of use covers the area 
of use of the CRSs.
However, when using GDA94 -> GDA2020, the area of use of those CRS is much 
larger, and there's only the Helmert-based transformation that covers the 
whole area. If you specify PROJ_SPATIAL_CRITERION_PARTIAL_INTERSECTION (or "--
spatial-test intersects" with projinfo), you ask PROJ to return coordinate 
operations whose area of use intersects at least partially with the one of the 
CRS, but do not necessarily cover them completely.

Directly from the EPSG dataset. Strangely enough, the accuracy advertized for 
those grids is 0.05m , whereas the one of the Helmert base transformation is 
0.01m. If you don't believe me, check EPSG:8048 and EPSG:8446 in
https://www.epsg-registry.org/

Odd. I suspect this was due to a misinterpretation of
http://www.icsm.gov.au/sites/default/files/DatumMattersT1FactSheet.pdf
. I'll find out what's required to get this fixed.

(hopefully) my last question:

If I have a proj string representing a coordinate operation, is there
any way to determine what grids are required for using it when those
grids are NOT available for use on the system?

Elsewhere I've used using proj_coordoperation_get_grid_used_count, but
this requires an existing coordinate operation object. Attempting to
create the (not available) coordinate operation using proj_create
fails with "Error -38: failed to load datum shift file". So as far as
I can see, there's no current way in API to determine the actual list
of missing grids which is preventing creation of a coordinate
operation. Or am I missing something?

Nyall,

I think you can use proj_coordoperation_get_grid_used() for that:

I can't use that one, because it requires an existing coordoperation
object, and I can't make the coordoperation when the grid doesn't
exist...

I'm not sure this will work for your particular use case (since you are instantiating
a PJ from a proj-string), but there is proj_operation_factory_context_set_grid_availability_use
which allow you to ignore unavailable grids when creating PJ objects from using a
PJ_OPERATION_FACTORY_CONTEXT. Here's an example from the tests:

https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/d67203a6f76a74f5ac029ff052dbcc72e3b59624/test/unit/test_c_api.cpp#L1316-L1351

which may guide you in the right direction.

I don't think so. As you find out, PROJ will refuse to instanciate a 
coordinate operation from a PROJ string that has a grids not present on the 
system.

Asthere are not so many ways of expressing grids in PROJ grids, basically you 
could look for +grids=xxxxx

Subject: [PROJ] PROJ.6 6.1.0 on macOS 10.14 w/o pkgsrc
Message-ID: <64435ac7-8451-c173-a1ec-e86ccec7256e@gmail.com>

Hi,

Thought to share a build experience with PROJ.6 6.1.0 on macOS Mojave 
(10.14) natively. A change in "configure" was required. I also passed 
extra variables to "configure". Let's call this a sanity check ahead of 
a bug report? Soonest I can generate diffs is at then end of this week.

In "configure" the test for the presence/absence of SQLite3 seems to 
always fail. In other words, absent pkgsrc, regardless of whether  
SQLITE3_CFLAGS and SQLITE3_LIBS are defined or not, the results are the 
same.  I have not, yet, installed pkgsrc.

To successfully compile, I also had to tease the right results out of 
configure. Notably, I pointed to SQLite3 twice.

$ ./configure -prefix=/opt/proj-6.1.0 
SQLITE3_CFLAGS=-I/opt/sqlite-3.28.0/include 
SQLITE3_LIBS=-L/opt/sqlite-3.28.0/lib -lsqlite3 CC=gcc -arch x86_64 
CXX=g++ -arch x86_64 CPP=gcc -E CXXCPP=g++ -E 
CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/sqlite-3.28.0/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/sqlite-3.28.0/lib 
-lsqlite3

Other subtleties may not apply, such as the SQLite3 build.

Tests passed.

If the "tests" for pkgsrc, and then SQLITE3_CFLAGS and SQLITE3_LIBS 
definitions failed on macOS, then it is possible they will fail on 
"Unix/Linux" as well. Possible? Plausible?

Thanks,

= David

Hi Craig,

there is no need to pay; a detailed how-to guide is freely
available for building PROJ 6.1 on Windows using MSYS2
(a Linux-like command shell) and MinGW64 (porting of the
renown gcc compiler for Windows platforms).

please read:

http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/mingw32_how_to.html#libproj
(to get the 32-bit library)

or

http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/mingw64_how_to.html#libproj
(to get the 64-bit library)

if you haven't yet installed MSYS2 and MinGW64 on your system
you can find a quick how-to from here:

http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/mingw32_how_to.html#env

I maintain proj for multiple platform on the opensuse build service. There is a 64- and 32-bit build for windows. I use it in my own software. Look at build.opensuse.org. Btw, there are also builds of 6.1.0 for many Linux versions maintained by me there. A windows build will arrive shortly (time...). 

You can search the site for packages. I can send a direct link when I’m back in the office if that fails.

Craig,

I build sqlite with these commands. Please find attached the .def file that
you'll also need

cl /c sqlite3.c /nologo /MD /Ox /DSQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA
/DSQLITE_ENABLE_RTREE
link /out:sqlite3.dll /implib:sqlite3.lib /def:sqlite3.def /dll
/MACHINE:X64 sqlite3.obj

Look at the 'html:' target in docs/Makefile. You probably need to replicate 
the hacks done for it in the 'dirhtml:' target

Unlike html target [1], the dirhtml [2] does not seem to be depending on the
target running doxygen to generate the XML.

Run make html first? Or ../scripts/doxygen.sh [3]

Subject: [PROJ] Anyone have success using cmake to build proj.4 version
 6.1.0 with visual studio 2017
Message-ID: <BYAPR06MB41037F17FFE3D82F87EEEF4AD11F0@BYAPR06MB4103.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

In an effort to reduce our software licensing costs, I have been tasked into looking at the level of effort required to remove our dependency on a commercial vendor's SDK and replace it with something else. Preliminary investigations indicate that PROJ.4 version 6.x may fit the bill. However, I have been struggling to get PROJ.4 to build successfully. We are a Windows shop and our custom built applications run in this OS environment. Unfortunately we do not have the luxury of porting all our apps to Linux at this time.

Has anyone successfully built PROJ v6.1.0 using cmake and visual studio 2017 on Windows 10? I have followed the instructions on the PROJ.4 website, but with no luck. After installing sqlite3 and extracting the proj-6.1.0.tar archive, I ran cmake. This is my command line.

cmake -DSQLITE3_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\temp\sqlite3 -DSQLITE3_LIBARARY=C:\temp\sqlite3\sqlite3.dll -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..

There are several fatal errors. Here are a few of them from the CMakeError.log.

fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'dlfcn.h': No such file or directory
fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'jni.h': No such file or directory
fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'unistd.h': No such file or directory

These are the versions of the tools I am using.

Windows 10 Enterprise v10.0.17134 Build 17134
cmake version 3.14.4
sqlite3 version 3.29.0
Visual Studio 2017 v15.9.12

In fact, v6.0.0 and v5.2.0 also reported the same cmake errors. I even tried Visual Studio 2013 (also with no luck)

However, I was able to build PROJ.4 v4.9.3 successfully. Unfortunately to continue my evaluation, I need to test the WKT string capabilities of the proj_create function. Only version 6.x supports this WKT functionality.

Further, I did read through the mail archives and came across a thread posted by a.furieri, but the replier's answer was to use MinGW64 and MYSY2. I would prefer to stick with cmake and VS2017.

Hi Kristian,

I will have a look at the link you provided. After googling for days, I'm surprised your link did not show up in my search results. I do appreciate your responding to my query so quickly. Thank you.

If an open source project of your interest uses Travis CI,
AppVeyor, Azure Pipelines, etc., first inspect how it
builds itself on those CI services

Hi Mateusz,

After looking at the links you and Kristian sent and with some tweaking, I was able to build version PROJ 6.1.0. Woo Hoo! Now the hard part comes, coming up with a level of effort for my managers. Thank you for your help!

Regards,
rifhc

All,

It's good to have friends in high places. Paul Ramsey was able to encourage the owner of proj.org <http://proj.org/> to donate the domain to our cause. The domain has been transferred to the OSGeo registrar and is currently in finalization at this time. Once that is complete (in the next few days), we can begin our transition from proj4.org <http://proj4.org/> to proj.org <http://proj.org/> if the PSC is supportive of such a migration. I know I am!

I propose that we keep another GH page up at https://proj4.org <https://proj4.org/> that 301s -> https://proj.org <https://proj.org/> for quite a while, and we adapt the CNAME of our current proj-docs repo to proj.org <http://proj.org/>.  Hopefully the transition does not need to be any rougher than that. If we need an RFC and vote to do this, someone chime in and we can do so, but I think the sentiment is we've wanted proj.org <http://proj.org/> all along and we are very glad to get it.

Thanks again to Paul Ramsey and the contributor of the domain (Paul can name him if that is ok). We really appreciate it!

Howard

This is fantastic news! Thank you guys for working on this. Definitely a +1 from me. Although I don’t think an RFC is needed - this is in line with the rebranding to PROJ that’s been ongoing for a couple of years already.

I agree that a redirect from proj4.org <http://proj4.org/> is necessary. This would also be a good occasion to rename the GitHub repository from proj.4 to PROJ. According to [0] any old links will be redirected to the new URL of the repository.

Subject: [PROJ] Catching error from proj_create_operations
Message-ID: <CAB28AshsJO-+5yNJknV09qAE5ZUeSq2uHHS-UUibv3+GQDkEXw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

What's the correct way to get errors as a result of a
proj_create_operations call? When trying to create a (deliberately)
bad operation, I can see on the console that proj throws a nice
descriptive warning:

"internal_proj_create_operations: Source and target ellipsoid do not
belong to the same celestial body"

And, as expected, the function returns a nullptr. I'm trying to
retrieve this descriptive error string for display to users, but can't
work out how to do this. I can't use proj_errno, since I don't have a
object to retrieve from. And if I try to retrieve from the context
using proj_context_errno, I just get a -61 "generic error of unknown
origin" message.

Any suggestions?

Nyall

In pyproj, we use a custom log function to catch the error log messages:
https://github.com/pyproj4/pyproj/blob/0221652c4cce274d72b0a82305d82c13e4b0535b/pyproj/_datadir.pyx#L9

And pass the custom function into `proj_log_func`:
https://github.com/pyproj4/pyproj/blob/0221652c4cce274d72b0a82305d82c13e4b0535b/pyproj/_datadir.pyx#L35

Hope this helps,
Alan

That's what I was originally thinking could be a fallback option. But
then, I can't see any way to get the detailed metadata relating to a
grid except for proj_coordoperation_get_grid_used. So even if I
captured the grid name from the proj string, I still can't determine
the url and package name, etc relating to that grid. (or can I?)

What I'm aiming to do is take a proj coordinate operation string
stored in a project file, and show a nice warning to users if it can't
be used locally, along with the links to download the missing grid
files.

In the C++ API, you have DatabaseContext::lookForGridInfo() that would cover 
this. Would need to be exposed in the C API.

All,

I have made the described migration changes, and DNS is currently in the process of sifting. 

http://proj.org/ <http://proj.org/> should work until the SSL certs from GitHub are all issued.

I will check back in 6 hours.

This is great. What is the plan for the timing of renaming the github repo
to PROJ?
