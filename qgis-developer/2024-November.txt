Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Plugin development and publishing
Message-ID: <20241103093124.44314a8e.dcz@porcupinefactory.org>

Hi all,

I started writing a QGIS plugin for CartoCSS, and this weekend I came back to it, only to see it needs debugging. Python was never a good match for the project, making developing a pain, so I have some questions:

Is it possible to publish a plugin which includes a compiled shared object? I noticed that mentions of C++ are absent from the plugins page, but that would free me from Python and let me use something with a powerful type system.

Is it possible to reload dependencies of a plugin? My plugin is made of several modules and the reloader can't handle that: the dependencies become stale and I end up committing broken code.

Are there any transpilers to Python?

Cheers,
dcz

Compiled for which small subset of the very large set of platforms on
which qgis runs?  This can't really work.

However, python code can use python modules that wrap libraries in other
languages, and you can document that the user into py-foo that wraps
libfoo first.

That would move the guts of the processing into libfoo.

> Are there any transpilers to Python?>

Interesting question.  I haven't heard of any.

Since plugins have to use the qgis license, there would need to be some
tooling to take the plugin source (also under that license of course)
and transpile.

Hello everyone,

I installed QGIS 3.40 [1] on Mac (M1) under macOS 15.1 today. It runs, but I get three messages regarding the startup script at startup. You can find the screenshots at [2].

Does anyone have a suggestion or a solution?

Hi Mike and devs,
the issue has been reported today also on GitHub [1].

Similar issues reported in the last months [2], occurring after the 
merging of [3] by ostr00000, have been already fixed.

qgis_3.34.12+16bullseye_i386.deb is there.

I would also add that QGIS 3.40 in not available for Debian bullseye.

The QGIS Web site reports that Debian bullseye is a supported 
distribution [1].

I would think that means "if you build the sources on that it should
work".

Things not being in Debian repos should be reported to Debian.

Greg, in that instance, no. QGIS maintains its own .deb repositories to 
provide new QGIS versions on older Debian/Ubuntu releases:

Also fixed  - but just in the website repo - the website build is still
pending. bullseye's grass is too old for 3.40.

Message-ID: <CACc2_6-JoHf-Y9Tgd6aPnon_G3eaYXtDZf-qw9X__5yJo-OnvA@mail.gmail.com>

Good people,

I'm a long-time and very appreciative user of QGIS but new to this list.
Please let me know if I'm doing the wrong thing here...

Background - I am also a long-time Ubuntu user (since 4.10 as it happens),
and I generally keep up with releases rather than only moving from LTS to
LTS every two years.  And so I have had two of my three systems running
24.10 since a few days after its release.

What's keeping me from moving my main system to 24.10 is the lack of QGIS
3.40 being available for it.  The standard Ubuntu repositories contain 3.34
and there is no "oracular" download on https://debian.qgis.org/debian/dists/,
though I can see the latest builds for earlier Ubuntus are dated 26 October.

This is no kind of complaint, but a request for information - is there
somewhere I can learn about the plan for releasing QGIS for the latest
Ubuntu version?  about blockers? about if there's anything I can do to
facilitate?

Thanks very much in advance, and the very best to all.

Dear Community,
Thanks for taking the time to respond to the community member vote.
The vote closed last week, and I want to share the unofficial results.

As stated, we had four slots up for elections and five candidates.

We had 20 votes with the following results

Germ?n Carrillo 19
Stefanos Natsis 16
Isabel Kiefer 16
Damiano Lombardi 15
Saber Razmjooei 14

I'm still waiting for a response from two voters I could not confirm as
active QGIS contributors, so **these results still need to be considered
unofficial**.
If the voters were not confirmed as active, the only absolute difference
would be that Damiano would have the same votes as Saber, and we would need
to run a second round between them.

In this sense, I would already heartfeltly welcome Germ?n, Stefanos, and
Isabel to our voting members community. Thank you so much for all you do
for the project!

I'll follow up with the definitive results next week with the next steps
needed.

Cheers Marco

Thank you Marco,
and thank you to those taking the time to vote; participating in commons is
an important part of the QGIS community.

I have a question regarding the ballot, though:
The new QGIS website says Germ?n is already a voting member as a
representative of the Colombian user group.
Is the site not up to date? Was the user group disbanded (I can see they
lost their registered domain)?

Best
Stefanos

Hey Stefanos,
That is correct, German is already listed as the *representative* of the
user group Colombia.
The UG Colombia vote is obviously not his vote but the vote of the
Colombian user group.

That means that he will be listed twice as we already have for other
members loke Harrissou and France.

Cheers Marco

Hi,

I believe this has been discussed. Was there any conclusion on this?

Just came across a Toot about a AI powered QGIS plugin (that I won't 
name to avoid advertizing it). In its description nothing mentions that 
it requires a paid subscription. Shouldn't we require that it is at 
least mentioned in the "about" metadata, and possibly a dedicated 
metadata item like "payment_required=true/false/partial" that could be 
used for filtering. And while we're at it 
"authentication_required=true/false/partial"? for plugins where payment 
is not needed but you need to have credentials one way or another (a 
plugin I'm developing for a French local administration would fall in 
that category. a few open web services but most requiring to be 
authorized by the administration)

My read of rough consensus was that at least labeling is obligatory.

I wonder if we should go further, and decline to provide free use of the
plugin infrastructure for other people to operate their businesses.   It
really should be doable for people to add other plugin catalogs, sort of
like f-droid enables one to configure multiple repositories.

I don't mean to object to the reg-required plugin you are working on.
But I would draw a line between

  plugin author and reg-required-entity are the same thing - not really ok

  plugin author and reg-required-entity are distinct - ok

I don't see that can work. So the mere fact of subcontracting the 
development of your plugin would make it suddenly OK.

And I don't think that's desirable either. We mostly need better tagging 
to potentially help filtering things in the UI.

By the way we'd probably need some sort of geography base tagging. A 
number of plugins are specific to users of a given country typically.

So, when applicable:

country=comma-separed list of 2-letter country ISO 3166 A-2 code 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes)

Ex: country=fr,be

and also:

language=comma-separted list of local names (as in 
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qlocale.html#uiLanguages)

Ex: language=en-US,fr-FR

Hello everyone,

This week, I concentrated on resolving most of the issues and taking into
account the feedback provided on the separated plugins, resources hub, and
planet website. All the pull requests on the new repositories were merged
and deployed as preview versions.

   - Plugins: https://staging.plugins.qgis.org, repo is at
   https://github.com/Xpirix/QGIS-Plugins-Website
   - Hub: http://hub.qgis/ (require VPN for now), repo is at
   https://github.com/Xpirix/QGIS-Hub-Website
   - Planet: https://xpirix.github.io/QGIS-Planet-Website/, repo is at
   https://github.com/Xpirix/QGIS-Planet-Website

We always welcome any new feedback on these updated sites.

To follow up on my previous email, we would greatly appreciate your input
on filtering posts specifically on the new Planet Website to only
QGIS-related content. Many posts are not related to QGIS.

The next steps would be to plan the migration of the separated websites and
then integrate the issues and pull requests from the QGIS-Django repository
into the new repositories. I will also try to work on other QGIS websites.

Have a nice weekend,

Best regards,

Lova Andriarimalala

Message-ID: <CAHMnyEW5g--qDUgjhhabUfkyDkffZAa3Wjc8A4jdm6Z5Z4KBcg@mail.gmail.com>

hi team, i need to convert a file/layer from "Polygon to Raster", it would
be so easy if you have to create or add a feature to the original vector
section or add it as a separate plugin to the activity in the
coming versions, thank you.

It's not clear to me what are the criteria to have a website's feed 
referenced. Is featured content only in English or other languages are 
accepted? Other criteria?
To filter on "QGIS" stuff only, do the planet support RSS items category to?

Regards,
Julien

It's not clear to me what are the criteria to have a website's feed 
referenced. Is featured content only in English or other languages are

To filter on "QGIS" stuff only, do the planet support RSS items category 
to?

Regards,
Julien

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] capturing kep press event in eventFilter
Message-ID: <b44250a0092f49388f8b6477c2e89441@erdc.dren.mil>

Trying to capture key combination ctrl+u in my event filter on the map canvas.  I have it checking for mouse events and those work fine, but I never get a key event when pressing any key.

def eventFilter(self, source, event)
     if event.type() == event.KeyPress:
            self._log_msg("Other Key Event")
            if event.modifiers() == Qt.ControlModifier and event.key() == Qt.Key_U:
                self._log_msg("Key Event: Ctrl+U")

If you are looking to rasterize a polygon the GDAL toolbox has three rasterize tools.

hi team, i need to convert a file/layer from "Polygon to Raster", it would be so easy if you have to create or add a feature to the original vector section or add it as a separate plugin to the activity in the coming versions, thank you.

Hello Julien,

Thanks for your reply.

> It's not clear to me what are the criteria to have a website's feed
referenced. Is featured content only in English or other languages are
accepted? Other criteria?

For the time being, the separate Planet website has the same workflow as
the current website at https://plugins.qgis.org/planet/ (except for
switching to a static website). The posts are fetched from each
subscriber?s feed link (
https://github.com/Xpirix/QGIS-Planet-Website/blob/main/data/subscribers.json)
without any filtering. The subscribers.json file serves as the primary
entry point, so the feed link should be included there to display on the
Planet website.

Most of the posts are in English, but since there?s no language filter,
there are a few posts in other languages.

> To filter on "QGIS" stuff only, do the planet support RSS items category
to?

Yes, it supports item categories, which are translated as tags. We could
primarily base the filter on them (only items with QGIS in the category).
If QGIS isn?t present in the category, we could check the post title and
then the content when fetching the feeds.

Best regards,

Lova Andriarimalala

the security requirements of IT departments keeps on growing and we 
receive more and more requests on the security mail.

The topic is broad, from filling in custom forms based on various 
national or company-specific policies, to very precise vulnerability 
scanning, or even ask us what we do to prevent XZ-like social 
engineering attacks.

To get a better score on good practices [0], a simple first step would 
be to activate code scanning. Github provides CodeQL [1] for free. I 
would like to activate it and see how it goes.

Would you be OK with activating this and see how it goes (too much 
spamming, limitations on our codebase, more advanced configuration 
required etc... ) ?

 ?In case of no reaction, I'll push the button on friday and see what 
happens :)


@lova @Tim, we probably should do similar things for our websites, we 
have some bounty seekers raising disclosures on our websites. I'd prefer 
that we catch those CVE earlier than have to deal with some of those 
anonymous persons.


Thanks a lot !

R?gis

R?gis,

you will probably need a bit more work than just pushing the default 
button, as it will likely generate a default codeql.yml file that won't 
work out-of-the-box on QGIS without tuning it. You'll need first to 
install the list of QGIS dependencies to get a successful build.? Cf 
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/.github/workflows/codeql.yml 
for an example on GDAL. We disabled Python scanning, as 99% of Python is 
in our test suite and I didn't want to be spammed about warnings in 
non-production code. Turned on a large code base like QGIS, be ready to 
see several hundreds of warnings popping up. In GDAL, one of the most 
recurring category was about "Multiplication result converted to larger 
type", ie doing something like int64_t var = some_int_32_var * 
another_int_32_var. Another thing I noticed with CodeQL is that it seems 
to limit the analysis to a max number of files, more or less randomly 
chosen depending on builds. So while we have it enabled for pull 
requests, in some cases, it missed new warnings specific on the PR 
during the review of the PR, but it then analyzed the modified files 
during a run in master. As QGIS is larger than GDAL, I would expect that 
to happen for QGIS too. That said, there's probably no harm in enabling 
it as the number or detail of warnings is only visible to users with 
write privileges to the repository

Thanks a lot for you insights Even!

Ok then, this is way beyond my skills and available time, let's forget 
this naive approach.? And let's plant a seed. Any Grant proposal toward 
enabling code scanning would be probably more than welcome.

I know some of you are trying to gather funding to approach the security 
globally. If plans are already made, please express yourselves here. As 
a person in charge of responding to security inquiries, I need some 
visibility here.

Best regards

R?gis

There was some discussion about Security within OSGeo a while back. Jody 
did some discussion on this, but I don't know where things are.

This is a related post 
-https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2023-November/039996.html - 
OSGeo Cyber Resilience Act statement - I know it's not the same thing, 
but it is related.

This was the thread I was looking for - 
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2023-December/040004.html.

Hope this helps.

Best wishes,
Nick.
