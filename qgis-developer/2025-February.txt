Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Orphaned QGIS StreetView Plugin
Message-ID: <D933C723-35E0-4988-A70E-6F70F9D9CF04@komendera.com>

Hello everybody,

I hope this is the correct place to ask for advice.

The StreetView plugin (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/StreetView/) is one I regularly use. However, all the links from the plugin details (Code repository, Tracker, Plugin home page) are dead.

As I?m testing the macOS/arm64 Qt6 builds (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/60039#issuecomment-2567661209) I adapted the plugin to be compatible with it Qt6 and am now looking if others are interested. As the original code repo seems to be gone, pushed my changes here: https://codeberg.org/kommen/QGIS-Streetview

How does the QGIS community deal with such apparently orphaned plugins? 
Would it be acceptable if I create a new plugin entry on plugins.qgis.org <http://plugins.qgis.org/> with a slightly different name where I upload my Qt6 compatible version?

Thank you all in advance 
Dieter

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Running into error 'Cannot modify tag
 "PhotometricInterpretation" while writing'
Message-ID: <fd1f52513dca1.2dd5a179ea2ef@odyhpc.com>

Hello,The following snippet band = gdal_ds.GetRasterBand(1) 
band.SetNoDataValue(no_data) ... band.WriteArray(data_scaled2) self.colors 
= gdal.ColorTable() self.colors.CreateColorRamp(0, (0, 0, 0), 255, (0, 0, 
0)) # or a more complex color ramp band.SetRasterColorTable(self.colors) 
band.SetRasterColorInterpretation(gdal.GCI_PaletteIndex) 
gdal_ds.FlushCache()generates the RuntimeError 'TIFFSetField?tmp/.../tif: 
Cannot modify tag "PhotometricInterpretation" while writing' when executing 
the line 'band.SetRasterColorTable(self.colors)' [it traces back to line 
5133 in gdal.py]. The confounding thing is that this error has only come up 
when upgrading to QGISv3.40 (and its corresponding updated GDAL) as I have 
run this code dozens of times with v3.34 (and previously with v3.30) 
without any issue. Thanks.

Hi Dieter,

The proper way would be to ask the original owner of the plugin to take over ownership.
(as admins we also have an email address for ever owner)

I'll sent you the mail addres in a separate mail (and put him in bcc for this mail).

Please contact the owner, and let him sent an email to this list telling it is ok to take ownership.

Then we can keep the same (good :-) ) name and you can take over ownership and upload new plugins.

(In case all fails, as in mail bounces or really not able to contact we can always move ownership)

Note about that the original repo is gone... I'm not sure if Google Streetview actually is OK with this kind of plugins, maybe he was afraid of legal stuff?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Knowing Google, I don?t rule it out completely, but as the plugin doesn?t scrape any data and just links to the public Street View page in the browser, it seems unlikely to me.

Anyway, I will try to contact the original owner.

all the best
Dieter

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QEP 320: Backport policies
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgNbSSBCqfo2V45_Lia-rrb_JWCFk1tD7C7A8E9is-jgg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just opened
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/320 "Backport
policies". This QEP documents the standards and requirements for
backporting changes from the master branch to Long Term Release (LTR) and
current stable release branches in QGIS. Developers must follow these
guidelines when submitting backports.

It is initially intended as a formal description of CURRENT BACKPORT
PRACTICES ONLY, which can be later modified and revised (in an atomic
manner) if we want to change any of these policies. As such, please refrain
from using this initial QEP as a place to discuss changes to current
practice. Rather, let's keep discussion focused on whether this is an
accurate and complete description of our current backporting policies. ?

The end goal here is having a formal policy in place describing all our
backporting rules, which will help ease new developers into contributing
effectively to QGIS and remove some of the unspoken assumptions surrounding
QGIS development.

Please leave discussion and questions on
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/320 so that we have
a formal record of the discussion.

Hi,

Do you know if QGIS weekly builds for Windows (
https://download.osgeo.org/qgis/windows/weekly/?C=M&O=D) are still being
generated? The last build is from 13/01/2025 which is a bit longer than a
week :)

Kind regards
Saber

This proposal has passed the 2 week discussion phase and is ready for

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] issues.qgis.org down -- is this intentional?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjbFMU53efXQMq_hfda=UH18VmXAR343ujEPZrm3LQGaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

While looking over some old bug reports (eg
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/18917) I'm unable to download the
projects + images from the ticket, as they link to issues.qgis.org,
which just results in an "internal error" page.

Was issues.qgis.org intentionally shut down? Or is this something
which can be fixed?

Message-ID: <7a7aeb91-b316-402c-b903-974e1f3db61e@spatialys.com>

Hi PSC,

I'd like to propose that Benoit de Mezzo 
(https://github.com/benoitdm-oslandia) and Jean Felder 
(https://github.com/ptitjano) are granted core committer rights.

They have been active on QGIS development for 3 years now, especially on 
the 3D part and also on server, contributing interesting features and 
fixes, on particularly tedious areas.
They also proved their capability to listen and integrate feedback into 
their work. They showed their dedication to quality of the code and 
contribution process.
They also actively contribute to PR reviews and general community effort.
They are willing to stay involved with the QGIS project and continue to 
be active contributors.
I believe it is time to acknowledge their continuous involvement in the 
project.

Different cause.  jammy's cmake is too old
(https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/cmake).

Thank you for working on this! Would you mind sharing why this did not work?
It would be interesting to know why this stopped working so that we can 
prevent it from happening again in the future.
How can we help you?

qgis.ico was missing - because I added a local cleaning step after successful
builds, that deleted it.

Hi,

Nothing against this nomination but I remember the discussion for becoming
a core contributor was raised before with the PSC and it was agreed the
current method is not ideal and should be reviewed. There was a plan to
formalise the process. There were concerns about security, rationale to
have write access, number of contributors from an entity, ... but I have
not seen the discussions on that. Similar to QEP, I think this process also
would benefit from formalisation.

Kind regards
Saber

Seeing the size of the pull request queue that is always on the verge of 
exploding, I believe we need more people who actively use their merge 
rights than the contrary. The below statistics of who merged the last 
1000 pull requests is pretty telling:

Merges per person:
nyalldawson: 588
m-kuhn: 62
troopa81: 59
3nids: 58
rouault: 54
alexbruy: 45
wonder-sk: 41
lbartoletti: 27
elpaso: 20
nirvn: 16
uclaros: 13
jef-n: 5
strk: 4
mhugent: 2
signedav: 2
rldhont: 2
tomkralidis: 1
PeterPetrik: 1

I shouldn't speak for Nyall, but if I was in his position, I would feel 
overwhelmed and would enjoy more people helping. This also shows there's 
no obvious Oslandia's uptaking of the project.

If we are really concerned about security reasons and want to keep a ~ 
single person merging into the main repository (but that would be 
officially adopting a benevolent dictatorship model), we need to 
structure the project in a completely different way, for example ala 
Linux kernel, with a repository/tree per "component" (3D, server, 
processing, etc.), with one responsible for each repository, and them 
sending big pull requests to the main integrator. But that would 
certainly complicate and slow down QGIS development (hard to tell if it 
would be a good or bad thing). QGIS is probably in an intermediate 
position between the typical small/medium github project and the huge 
project like the Linux kernel.

Hi

I second the nominations for both, Jean and Benoit.
They are active for a long time, provide high quality code and are able to
work in a team. They also didn't just provide code but also participate by
giving feedback.

Best regards
Matthias

+1, for all the reasons previously listed! We're very lucky to have
these two onboard!

rationale to have write access, number of contributors from an entity, ...
but I have not seen the discussions on that. Similar to QEP, I think this
process also would benefit from formalisation.

(I'm splitting this off to a new thread so as not to hijack the original,
which should instead be focused on Benoit's/Jean's contributions and
achievements. They are both wonderful QGIS developers and I don't want any
of the following to be mis-interpreted as anything to do with these two
contributors in any way, or as blocking their nominations under the current
policies/processes!)

That said: I strongly believe that we are overdue for an URGENT review of
how we handle "core contributors" and git commit rights.

This topic was raised some time ago in this thread:
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-psc/2020-June/008895.html , but
unfortunately the discussion did not lead to any concrete policy changes.

That thread swings between a whole lot of different ideas/topics, but the
main pressing concern I have right now is that we have NO formal policy or
process for "sunsetting" developers we have previously given commit rights
to. This is a very large security risk -- we have developers who have not
contributed to the project (or other open source geo projects) in years,
but who still have full commit rights to our code repository.

So, as an urgent band-aid fix to this, I would like to propose the
following:

1. We amend
https://web.archive.org/web/20240116120206/https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/contributor_requirements.html
(i can't find where this page was moved to on the new website!! ?) to add
a term:

"I agree to immediately notify the QGIS project in the case of a change in
job position or personal circumstances which means that I am unlikely to
continue regular contributions to QGIS. I understand that my commit rights
may be revoked at this time."

2. We make a policy that after 12 months without significant code
contributions to QGIS, a developer's commit rights will be revoked. (That
developer is obviously still able to contribute to QGIS, review code, send
in pull requests, etc... they just won't have merge rights themselves
anymore). These rights can be resurrected when regular contributions
re-commence. A good example of this would be Paul Blottiere -- he's no
longer involved directly in QGIS development, but does still respond when
pinged on code related questions. He does not need and should not have
direct commit rights anymore. This is NOT a reflection on his abilities,
committment or anything -- it's just plugging a security hole in our
processes.[1] (For reference, of the 39 developers who currently have
direct commit rights, 12 have not committed to the repo in 2 years or
more!).

3. We make some pro-active policy for handling "bad actors". This might be
as simple as adding "I understand that at any stage PSC my act to remove my
commit rights", and document somewhere that in extreme cases PSC has this
right.

And then the next issue ?... we have people who were nominated for core
committer status over the last couple of years but who NEVER received this
status, I think because of the  current uncertainty in the whole process.
Specifically I'm thinking of Andrea Giudiceandrea, who was nominated in
Aug 2023. Andrea is SOO extremely valuable to the project, and I would hate
to think that there's any ill-will or risk of resentment because of this.
What do we need to do to move forward with Andrea's nomination?

rights:

Hi,
Thank you Nyall for raising this topic again regarding the management of commit rights in QGIS.
I fully support this proposal, which I find particularly relevant for the security and sustainability of the project. Having observed similar policies in other major open source projects, the 12-month inactivity period seems to be a reasonable and balanced timeframe.
As you point out, it's important to note that activity is not solely measured by direct commits, but encompasses all significant contributions to the project (code reviews, participation in technical discussions, etc.).In addition to describing the points I'm in favor of, I think it's important to write down the policies with a dedicated page. Inspired by different projects/ideas, I've made a first draft, in the attached markdown.?Feel free to adapt/improve...

Lo?c

(In this thread, I won't write about nomination.)

Actually, I **would** consider only code merges/commits in this 12
month threshold. If someone is making other contributions to the
project (tech discussion, issue filing, etc) then they don't need
commit rights for those, and won't be impacted by their removal.
Again, we need to stress that the rights removal isn't due to a lack
of trust in an individual, but rather a lack of necessity and in order
to minimise the potential attack surface for the QGIS project.

Hi,

I agree that we need a formal proposal for all the points that you rise,
and I agree also with what you propose.

Regarding Andrea's nomination, We were 6 to agree on giving him the
committer's right [0] and no one said no, so I don't see any reason not
to proceed with its nomination.

Regards,
Julien

I'm sorry, this is probably because no one is officially appointed to take
care of these matters, I volunteer to do it from now on, please ping me in
case I miss something.

(I will give Andrea commit rights immediately).

I don't think Andrea was asked to agree to the contributor agreement yet
though - that should probably happen first?

*?????Maintenance notice:* On 10 February 2025 at 10h00 UTC we will be
performing scheduled maintenance to upgrade the plugins web server. During
this update, following services may be temporarily disrupted:

- Installing plugins via the QGIS plugin manager
- Viewing / uploading / managing plugins on plugins.qgis.org
- Accessing the hub resources
- Access to plugins-analytics.qgis.org

Thank you for your patience

Hi Nyall

Thanks for raising this.

I think you should include my name in the sunsetted (?) users list. I can
always make a PR if I get to C++ coding land again..

For the web page, Lova has kindly prepared this:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/541

My suggestion is to first merge that (reflecting the current policy) and
then we can make a new PR to update the page once this discussion is
finalised.

Regards

Tim

Dear QGIS users and community team

We are pleased to share the updated web site for https://plugins.qgis.org.

The site has a fresh new look to match our branding overhaul as well as
many improvements in the user experience. Please let us know what you think!

Additionally, we have split the resources area (for sharing styles,
3d-models, projects, qlr files etc.) into its own site to make it more
discoverable. You can find it at the new URL: https://hub.qgis.org.  The
hub is also branded nicely to match our QGIS branding guidelines.

Many thanks to Lova for the great work, and to the sustaining members and
donors who's patronage was used to cover the cost of this update.

Our maintenance window is now closed and the plugins site should be working
normally again.

Regards

Tim

Dear QGIS Developers,

We?d like to start a focused effort on refactoring and improving the QGIS
Attribute Table. Over time, it has grown in complexity, and we see an
opportunity to enhance its performance, usability, and maintainability.

To support this effort, the QGIS Project Steering Committee (PSC) has
allocated a dedicated budget for this work, which will be distributed among
the involved core developers contributing to the refactoring process.

To kick things off, we?d like to organize a kickoff meeting where we can
define the main goals for the refactoring and identify contributors and
next steps.

Before setting a date, we?d like to know who is interested in joining the
kickoff meeting. If you?d like to participate, please reply to this thread
so we can coordinate a time that works for everyone.

Looking forward to your thoughts and participation!

Cheers
Marco

Thanks Tim! I'd intentionally omitted your name as I assumed you needed
permissions for something changelog/website related, but if not then let's
add you to the pending-removal list too...

(Note that Gary also technically would fall into this group, but I'd
propose a exemption for that special case ?)

@Nyall Dawson <nyall.dawson at gmail.com> I think Tim (and myself) belong in
that list. We get the needed permissions through the organisation in GH.

Regarding the subject, it is indeed a longstanding issue for which we had a
todo item that was never tackled [1].
Maybe we should start a QEP (with Loic's MD draft) so at the next PSC
(4.3.25) we can discuss it?

Cheers Marco

Ok, I've submitted
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/325 as a first
draft which takes Loic's document and expands on it with the
suggestions from the June 2020 discussions.

Let's move discussion over there?

Hey,

I know it's been a long time but I just visited the QGIS plugin site and I
just wanted to say how great it looks.  Whoever did that redesign (yes I
should have been paying attention sorry) should be super proud with how it
turned out.

Makes the whole project look super professional. It's great to see how far
it has come over the years back from when it was first started.

That looks amazing, shout outs to the whole team!

I don't know if it has anything to do with the redesign, but since 
yesterday I get an error from Cloudflare when trying to upload a new 
plugin version:

"Web server is returning an unknown error
Error code 520

There is an unknown connection issue between Cloudflare and the origin 
web server. As a result, the web page can not be displayed."

I tried multiple times in different moments, but always get the same 
error. Any idea whats happening?

Thanks
Gerald

Hi Gerald.

Thank you for the feedback. The issue that you mentioned is probably
related to the plugin size (should be <20Mb).
A similar issue has also been reported earlier (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/513), and I think it is time to
implement a proper check on the website to be explicit about it. I have
created an issue for it at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Plugins-Website/issues/67.

I hope this helps for now.

Best regards,

Lova Andriarimalala

Hi Ismail

Great news! There is also the button inside QGIS in the style manager that
should be updated. The old urls should still work with redirection so
hopefully we didnt break anything, but it would be nice to use the new url (
hub.qgis.org) for the hub.

Thanks Ismail!

Regards

Tim

Hi All
Lova, the site looks amazing and thanks for all of your work on it.

I am asking on behalf of one of my clients how does a plugin become
featured?

Kind regards
Em

Ha ha ha I think this question was raised years ago and I'm not sure what was the answer, if any. I wanted to browse the archives to find that before I ask again, but given that you did it, I second your question. This is the only group whose description doesn't clarify what it is.

Regards,
Harrissou

If they've all been manually picked at some time, can I suggest we
drop these ones from the list?

- Processing R Provider: it's quite a niche one, and requires a lot of
technical knowledge to get it to do anything in the first place
- Plugin builder/plugin reloader: these are plugin *developer* focused
plugins. I think the featured list should concentrate on user-focused
plugins.
- Mask: this is an older plugin, predominantly superseded by inbuilt
QGIS functionality now
- Time manager: as above

Thanks we will take care of that. As for the process of how things get
featured: There isn't any formal process in place. In the past someone (not
clear to me who) would nominate plugins to be featured, but it was done on
a whim I believe. Maybe we should unfeature everything and come up with a
formal process. I think being featured could be used to:

* raise the profile of less known plugins
* highlight 'game changer' plugins (e.g. some of the new AI based ones are
really interesting)
* highlight plugins that provide key complementary functionality to QGIS
e.g. QuickOSM, Ismail's new resources plugin etc.

We didnt really advertise it too much but we also have analytics on the
plugins repo and one of Lova's todo tasks is to improve the insights we can
gain from the plugins repo activity. If we can come up with something more
algorithmic to feature plugins we could use the metrics to do it but I
think it is probably more of a subjective process. Maybe we can have a
'nominate and vote' process and also make being featured ephemeral (e.g. 1
month).

@Lova Andriarimalala <lova at kartoza.com> can you surface the metrics into
the new plugins site submenu please (with a user friendly subdomain e.g.
plugin-metrics.qgis.org?

The plugins metrics page is accessible through
https://plugins-analytics.qgis.org/. I have also included it in the
plugins.qgis.org's navigation bar.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Experimental plugin flag, yes/no or True/False?
Message-ID: <50ec2f45-6e80-4c49-ba0e-db84a7f70605@terglobo.nl>

Yesterday I uploaded a new plugin and I set the experimental flag in the 
metadata.txt to True, as it should be according to the documentation here:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins/plugins.html#id4

(I mean the paragraph "16.1.2.1. metadata.txt" but the link doesn't 
exactly bring me there in my Browser.)

After uploading I did not check the experimental checkbox, as my 
metadata should override this anyway. (Why do both exist anyway??)

However, my plugin was not published as experimental, but as a normal 
plugin discoverable for everyone.

Now I remember that we used to have experimental=yes in the metadata, so 
the documentation might be wrong? Can anyone explain or check?

Same counts for other boolean fields: deprecated, server and 
hasProcessingProvider.

By the way, the new plugin website looks wonderful!! ?

I guess we are still under the old rules and we can proceed with flipping
the write flag (or should we wait 12 months in case someone is on holiday)?

... just kidding ;-)

I'm replying here because I don't have the email addresses of Benoit de
Mezzo and Jean Felder (we should probably make sure the PSC has the emails
of who has write access to the repos in case we need them).

@ Benoit de Mezzo and Jean Felder
Please send to the psc mailing list an email where you state that you
accept/agree/abide/subscribe (not sure what is the correct word here) the
https://qgis.org/resources/support/contributors-requirements/#requirements-for-new-contributors
?

When you've done that I can flip the write bits.

Kind regards.

In my understanding, this has been implemented for the possibility of
checking the experimental when uploading, as this is not required in the
metadata.

Hi Raymond,

Currently, the correct values for these fields are True or False as
mentioned in the documentation.

However, it seems that the value from the checkbox is (was) prioritised
instead of the value from the metadata, which is not expected. The reason
seems unclear to me (probably the form component in the new UI) as I
remember it worked as expected before.
I have just applied and deployed a fix (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Plugins-Website/pull/72) to handle these
values correctly when uploading a plugin. This will get the value from the
checkbox if only the experimental attribute is not set in the metadata.txt.

Best regards,

Lova Andriarimalala

Message-ID: <909c6443-c992-46f4-855a-727fd0451c53@oslandia.com>

Hi,

Please see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/328

This proposal aims to enable the editing of point layers directly from the elevation profile. It will be possible to add new points, move existing ones, and delete them.
Additionally, selecting points from the elevation profile will be possible.
Editing directly within the elevation profile will make it easier to precisely adjust the elevation of 3D points.


Further detail is available at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/328

As usual, please submit feedback on the github Pull Request.


Thanks,
Jean

Message-ID: <CAB28AsigML5sVeKXfMbFtR-=Z-Cf2qSGVW13Aaa6yf4eYsMmmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just opened
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/329 "Code
submission and merge policies". This QEP documents policies for
submission of changes to the main QGIS code repository.

It is initially intended as a formal description of CURRENT PRACTICES
ONLY, which can be later modified and revised (in an atomic manner) if
we want to change any of these policies. As such, please refrain from
using this initial request as a place to discuss changes to current
practice. Rather, let's keep discussion focused on whether this is an
accurate and complete description of our current submission practices.
?

The end goal here is having a formal policy in place describing all
our change submission rules, which will help ease new developers into
contributing effectively to QGIS and remove some of the unspoken
assumptions surrounding QGIS development.

Please leave discussion and questions on
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/329 so that we
have a formal record of the discussion.

Nyall

Back in the days when the plugin site was designed and the plugins were
just a couple of dozen it seemed nice to have a way to showcase what we
(the small QGIS community) thought they were the most amazing, it was an
editorial choice.

I guess it doesn't make much sense to keep that list nowaday.

Unless a publicity/marketing team (or an individual with an easy pen) steps up, starts writing something like 'This week/month in QGIS' (see https://thisweek.gnome.org/ as an example) and then one plugin per month is already a start to get a plugin featured?

(I know shooting idea's is easier then DOing it... writing blog texts kills me, but I hope there is somebody who....)

Maybe this can be replaced by something similar, but more reliable and 
fair?

Recently, a customer of mine asked me if there was a list of plugins 
that can be trusted. They felt vulnerable having all QGIS users in the 
organisation downloading any plugin (= python code) and running it. On 
the other hand, QGIS without plugins is pretty useless.

I was thinking about an option for plugins to get a quality tag, for 
example when is has multiple developers reviewing each others code. Or a 
certified company reviewing plugin code. Like the certified companies 
for education? Or uploading/updating a "trusted plugin" cost 100 euros, 
and the one approving the plugin code gets that money?

All pretty hard to set up I think, but I also understand the need.

Maybe someone here has a better idea?

I like this idea of having it reviewed for a cost!

I think a good (although not necessarily easy) solution would be to introduce code signing. A first step could just be to enable signed plugins to be uploaded/downloaded and allowing users to trust a given public key, using something like OpenPGP. This would already provide a bit of additional security by ensuring that the code has not been tampered with between the developer and the user, and for example internal plugins could be signed using a key that's trusted organization-wide using some suitable configuration file. The next, and arguably harder, step would then be to introduce a list of pre-trusted keys.

Another aspect is that of responsibility and how deep the trust should go. If I have signed a plugin I've developed (or QGIS.org has set a certain quality level for a plugin, or something else), does that mean I've/QGIS.org have assumed responsibility in case the code does something bad? What if, to the best of my knowledge, it does not, but a user installs it in a QGIS environment with different versions of Python packages, which results in a massive data loss bug? Most likely the answer is a clear "there's no further responsibility than there already is today", but that should be made clear as there otherwise will be users who blindly trust something as long as there is a gold badge next to it.

Maybe this can be replaced by something similar, but more reliable and fair?

Recently, a customer of mine asked me if there was a list of plugins that can be trusted. They felt vulnerable having all QGIS users in the organisation downloading any plugin (= python code) and running it. On the other hand, QGIS without plugins is pretty useless.

I was thinking about an option for plugins to get a quality tag, for example when is has multiple developers reviewing each others code. Or a certified company reviewing plugin code. Like the certified companies for education? Or uploading/updating a "trusted plugin" cost 100 euros, and the one approving the plugin code gets that money?

All pretty hard to set up I think, but I also understand the need.

Maybe someone here has a better idea?
