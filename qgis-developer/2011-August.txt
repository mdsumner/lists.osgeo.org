What exactly is your setting? GUI is written in python and you want to
pass points from there to a c++ class? Is that a QObject descendant
and do you have a reference to it in python? How do you declare the
slot in the c++ class? In case you use custom types for signals/slots
do not forget to call qRegisterMetaType() before connecting. It would
be better to start with a simple case - make sure that sending a
signal without parameters works.

For doing GIS work one must perform these actions many times not just from a single geometry, but in groups. So my humble request is to place a function function (perhaps in QgsSpatialIndex that will take a data layer and return a spatial index.

Such a function might be added in future, however it is a matter of
few lines of code, so no problem to write it yourself - and eventually
submit a patch ;-)

Yes that would be a nice feature to have.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problem with QGIS 1.7 "--snapshot"?
Message-ID: <4E381431.8090700@GotSlack.org>

I have a simple project which includes a BlueMarble geotiff background, 
a shapefile of U.S. state boundaries, and several shapefiles of 
projected tropical storm tracks.  When I save an image of the map 
interactively using the "Save as Image" menu item, the resulting png 
file accurately reflects what is on the screen.  However, when I save an 
image from the command line using  "$ qgis tropical.qgs --snapshot 
snapshot.png" the BlueMarble image is shifted.  You can see the images 
here (I converted the png files to jpeg to save space/bandwidth):

http://gotslack.org/hammack/qgis

I am running QGIS 1.7 built from scratch on a Slackware 13.1 system.  
All of the files are in epsg:4326.  I have the same problem if I use a 
TrueMarble geotiff in place of the BlueMarble so it seems like a problem 
with "snapshot" rather than with the data.  I used the same method last 
hurricane season with QGIS 1.6 and had no problems.

Any ideas?

                                                     Thanks,
                                                         Jim

Tim, my impression is that it speeds things up, but?I have a suggestion to make it faster.

From what I have seen in your code, the??QgsGdalProvider::bandStatistics function calls?GDALComputeRasterStatistics (), which computes the statistics every time - it doesn't fetch pre-calculated data ( which is stored in gtiff metadata, or aux.xml file). ?

A better way would be to use the?GDALGetRasterStatistics() which calls?GDALComputeRasterStatistics() when needed (when?bForce = TRUE)
double myerval =??GDALGetRasterStatistics ( myGdalBand, bApproxOK, TRUE, &pdfMin, &pdfMax, &pdfMean, &pdfStdDev);



I have tested it on a few rasters, it gets the same stats.

The downside is that GDALGetRasterStatistics() does not offer a progress callback, rendering the progressbar useless. ?
If it"s really needed, I could re-implement the function in ?QgsGdalProvider (about 50 lines of code), or try to have?GDALGetRasterStatistics support a progress callback.

regards, Etienne

Thanks for your feedback Marco. I guess I'll write some unit tests

there are no other objections. :-)

Ah - actually I thought GDALComputeRasterStatistics was using aux.xml
cached stats already. I guess I never read the docs carefully enough.
I applied your change and my ~8min to load raster from my original
email took about a minute to load the first time (while gdal was
creating an aux.xml) and subsequent use of the same raster resulted in
it opening instantly! So thanks for your excellent advice. I have
pushed an updated version to my repo that incorporates your changes
should others like to try. I will try to write some unit tests this
week and then merge my branch into QGIS master over the weekend.

Yes this is quite noticeable the first time the raster is loaded and
you sit wondering what is happening. I guess the more elegant would be
to have the change carried out in gdal itself if that is acceptible,
otherwise your patch as per your former suggestion would be greatly
appreciated.

Hi Jim

I'm guessing this is something to do with the new on the fly
reprojection support for rasters (the main difference between 1.6 and
1.7). I was able to replicate the issue here on the release-1_7_0
branch with all backported fixes applied. Under master branch, it
didnt even get as far as producing a snapshot. Could you file a ticket
for this? We will try to fix it for 1.7.1 9assign the ticket to me for
now).

Thanks

Tim

Hi Again

By the way is there a handy way to get the histogram from the aux.xml
too? I see it is stored there but havent figured out how to retrieve
it from cache again.

Hi,

I added a regions.shp shape to the Alaska dataset and rename the folder
vmap0_shapefiles to shapefiles. This gives some more possibilities to
analyse vector data.

You find a README.html and the updated dataset here:

Hi, I'm glad I can help!

1) regarding the histogram caching:
GDAL does this automatically, it looks for existing aux file and a 
suitable histogram block.? It's all in function? 
GDALPamRasterBand::PamFindMatchingHistogram() in file 
gdalpamrasterband.cpp .
As long as the dataset has support for PAM (stored in the .aux.xml file), it should work.
I found a bug in the floating-point comparison which was already fixed: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/4183

Unlike the stats functions (GetStatistics/ComputeStatistics), there is only 1 function which looks for cached data.


2) regarding the caching of stats:
Actually the GDAL driver looks for stored metadata (in function? GDALRasterBand::GetStatistics).
This works for gtiff files, I don't know for other raster types.


3) regarding the progress bar:
Do you have sufficient authority to ask the GDAL folks to change the prototype for GDALGetRasterStatistics() and GetStatistics() for them to include a progress call-back?? I could make a patch for it, but I don't know if they would accept it.? 
In the mean time, I can copy the GDAL code into? qgsgdalprovider and submit that patch to you.

4)
There is another issue I forgot to mention, and that is the bin count of the 
histogram.? GDAL uses 256 bins, and recently the GDAL histogram 
calculation? in QgsRasterLayerProperties::refreshHistogram()? has been 
changed to use 255 bins. ( const int BINCOUNT = 255; ).? Could this be 
put back to 256 for consistency with GDAL, or is there a reason for 
that?


Thanks! Etienne

Hi Again

By the way is there a handy way to get the histogram from the aux.xml
too? I see it is stored there but haven't figured out how to retrieve
it from cache again.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CAPS GIS Desktop Application
Message-ID: <1312394829908-6649673.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hi All,

With some grant funding, I am developing a PyQGIS desktop application for
the Conservation Assessment and Prioritization System (CAPS).  See
http://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/caps/caps.html for more info.  I've
developed the GUI using PyQt, and I've also got many of the GIS tools
working (i.e layer list, pan, zoom, load rasters and vectors from the file
system etc.).  I'll be putting the code and project specifications on
Sourceforge in the next week or two, and I'll post the project name and url
when I do.

I've noticed that the QgsRasterLayer class included with the  QGIS Stable
1.0 API that came with my QGIS Copiapo installation does not have MrSID
support, although the Copiapo application itself does open MrSID files.  I
suppose it isn't possible to add MrSID support by changing the GDAL version
in the API in code because GDAL is compiled in?  Does the API that comes
with Wroclaw have MrSID support? If not, I guess I could use the Python
bindings for GDAL to create a workaround?

Thanks in advance for any advice.  I'll be monitoring this list from now on,
and I'll try to make some contributions if I have any help I can offer.

Thanks again,
Bob

I do not think that GDAL folks would change the GetRasterStatistics
function prototype since changing it would result in breakage of
binary compatibility. The best approach is to post your idea on
gdal-dev list and to get some suggestions how to proceed. Since this
would require an addition to GDAL API (e.g. a new function
GetRasterStatisticsWithFeedback) you would probably need a prepare
short RFC for that feature and get it approved - otherwise the new
feature will likely not get into GDAL.

Tim, Martin, Marco, Pirmin, Juergen and others,

The community device program for Nokia N950 has been extended. 50
units are available for porting application to Meego app.

http://wiki.meego.com/Community_Office/Community_device_program/Nokia/N950_Extended_Program

I think this is a good opportunity for the one of the QGIS core
developers to apply for this program.

I think it is easier to port QGIS to Meego QGIS mobile than any other
mobile devices. The libraries can be easily compiled in Qt 4.7/4.8 and
QGIS UI can be remodelled using QML.

I hope one of the core qgis developer would apply for this device
program and port QGIS for Meego.

Meego Nokia N9 will be released soon (e.g. Sept 15 in Switzerland)

Probably some folks are wondering what's good about MeeGo and upcoming
devices (e.g N9/N950).

Here some facts and tidbits about it.

QGIS would likely to works MeeGo with less code changes compare to
other mobile devices.

Hi Noli.
Thanks for this. I'm confused about the future of MeeGo, now that Microsoft has a
strong influence in Nokia: do you have better data on this?
All the best.

Hi Bob.
I'm interested. Just a curiosity: why a standalone app instead of a plugin? I see a
number of advantages in this second approach.
All the best.

Hi Paulo,

Elop (Nokia CEO) is pushing his own agenda - Nokia and Microsoft for
"enterprise" solution. Microsoft even renamed the WP7 phone into Mango
- sound like Meego, just confuse the non tech people. Nokia will
released Nokia N9 (Meego) probably before we can see Nokia Mango
device. Nokia and Microsoft has scheduled 16 August in Germany for the
Mango event. Some rumours said that during the event no Nokia mango
device for the event.

In my opinion, the Nokia Board of Directors decided that that the 2
strategies - Nokia - Microsoft (Elop) and MeeGo and Symbiam Camp (mid
management staff marketing Meego and Symbian devices (e.g. Nokia 500
just released the other day). They are complement products (Mango for
old and traditional market) and MeeGo for new generation - young and
technical literature.

Tonight Previewed of Nokia N9 in Malaysia
http://www.meegoexperts.com/2011/08/nokia-n9-previewed-malaysia-tonight/

For MeeGo tablet, Acer and Asus will release before Nokia. Intel has
research centre for software development in China for MeeGo
development after Nokia withdraw partially support for Meego. Meego UX
Tablet UI is developed by Intel, not Nokia.

Nvidia also released the hardfp for Tegra 2 which led to the running
Meego in nvidia Tegra 2 chipset - Trim Slice -Meego TV.

http://www.meegoexperts.com/2011/08/trim-slice-dev-kits-45-meego-tv/
http://www.meegoexperts.com/2011/08/xbmc-running-nvidia-tegra2-trimslice-arm-hard-floating-point/

Some people in XDA forum are looking on Asus transformer (Android)
tegra 2 to be ported to MeeGo. The device has dual boot with ubuntu 11
partially working, I think.

I hope to see Intel MeeGo tablets soon.

Nokia labs is busy working on Qt Creator for Meego, trying to mimic
iPhone UI (e.g. Address book list)
http://labs.qt.nokia.com/

Ok for me it seems to recompute the histogram every time (which takes
about a minute+ with the sample data set I sent you). I will update my
gdal svn copy to get your patch for #4183 and see if the problem goes
away.

Ok Martin addressed this in his email in this thread. I basically have
no more authority than anyone else in the community - they evauate
each request based on merit. As Martin mentions, breaking ABI
compatibility will not go down well with them so providing a wrapper
function which adds progress support (or perhaps adding the progress
callback as the last param with a default of void so that it can be
left out will be acceptable to them) would be good.

Cool stuff! Next we can try to make our unit tests run from there. If
I try to manually run a test e.g.

output/bin/qgis_rasterlayertest

it doesnt pick up any providers. I notice also that the binaries
placed in the output dir still will pick up system qgis libs e.g.:

[bin] ldd qgis_rasterlayertest
libqgis_core.so.1.8.0 => /usr/local/lib/libqgis_core.so.1.8.0
(0x00007f6305787000)

Though for QGIS they are correct:

[bin] ldd qgis | grep core
	libqgis_core.so.1.8.0 =>
/home/timlinux/dev/cpp/Quantum-GIS/build-master-qtcreator/output/lib/libqgis_core.so.1.8.0
(0x00007fccd97c3000)

Also at runtime they use resources from the system install e.g.:

[bin] ./qgis_applicationtest
********* Start testing of TestQgsApplication *********

I am really looking forward to getting the test suite under way. How
did you tell cmake to link to the correct libs for QGIS? perhaps we
can apply the same approach to the test dir?

QgsRasterLayer don't have any raster support at all. Reading rasters
is responsibility
of the raster provider (GDAL). So you need to build GDAL with MrSID
support and then
build QGIS with this new GDAL.

Hope this helps

Oh, I forgot to fix unit tests :-)

By default CMake adds RPATH to binaries that are produced so that they
will reach the libraries within build directory. Later when doing
'make install' it removes the RPATH, otherwise the binaries would
still pick up the libraries from build directory.

Looking at the ADD_QGIS_TEST macro I see that we explicitly disable
RPATH because until now also the tests would need to be installed to
work correctly. I am not at the dev box right now, but removing
SKIP_BUILD_RPATH property from the macro should fix that.

With the support for running qgis from build path I think we should
not install the tests anymore...

Agreed.

Hi

For all interested, I have applied the first changes to master (see
http://linfiniti.com/2011/08/improvements-to-raster-performance-in-qgis-master/)....and
with a unit test! :-)

I still need to apply Etienne's patch for progress bar support which I
hope to do in this week.

regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] State of un-bundling libs from QGIS
Message-ID: <201108042334.30074.volker27@gmx.at>

Dear developers,

today the Spatialindex package got approved for Fedora, the Qwtpolar package 
is there for one or two weeks now. Cmake lets you choose between the bundled 
version of Qwtpolar and a system wide for some time now. 2 weeks back I posted 
a patch that allows the buildsystem to use a system wide Spatialindex. In 
order to achieve that, I also had to modify the Spatialindex wrapper. You can 
find the patch here: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4111

I'd like to build Fedora's QGIS with the external Qwtpolar and Spatialindex, 
but would like to have your review on the patch first, since I am not a 
programmer.

The remaining bundles I know of are:

Name:libpal
Website: http://geosysin.iict.ch/trac/wiki/Index4extJPAL
Location: src/core/pal

Comment:

Martin Dobias did a lot of work on that one in 2009 and he and others continue 
to do so. I recently wrote to Olivier Ertz, who is one of the original 
authors, whether he was still interested in the library and interested in 
merging the improvements upstream. I can try to help in this process, but I 
don't know if I'm any help.


Name: qextserialport
Website: http://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/
Location: src/core/gps/qextserialport

Comment:

From what I saw on their tracker, they seem to have lots of users, but don't 
really respond to tickets. Thus there are a lot of open bug reports. Not even 
the license is completely clear, see 
http://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/issues/detail?id=8
There also were requests for a fork.


Name: qtermwidget
Website: http://qtermwidget.sourceforge.net/
Location: src/plugins/grass/qtermwidget

Comment:

No commits for more than 2 years. Something might be going on here: 
http://gitorious.org/qtermwidget


Name: nmealib
Website: http://nmea.sourceforge.net/ 
Location: src/core/gps

Comment:

There is a fork with new releases: 
https://github.com/fhuberts/nmealib/downloads


One thing I'm not particularly fond of, is Pyspatialite. Pyspatialite is a 
fork of PySqlite instead of an extension. I don't know though, if QGIS relies 
on it.

To proceed, I ask you to review my patch and please comment on the invidual 
libs, if there is more to know or I stated wrong.

I'm back and ready to work on this feature.

You're right, in this moment the first option allows to me to spend my
time on coding the real feature.

Yes, that would be the best solution.

I am wondering what other devs think....

My opinion is also to go with static provider functions for the moment.

Great stuff! I made a small blog post describing the feature here:

http://linfiniti.com/2011/08/new-hatching-modes-in-qgis-master-line-pattern-fill/

Just a small note: there seems to be a bug where the rotation angles
are not honoured when rendering (even though the symbol preview shows
them correctly) - see attached image. Also, would it be possible to
enable anti-aliasing on those lines?

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] should I use qgsVectorLayer
Message-ID: <op.vzqinuvm4ntzi3@travelmate.localdomain>

Hi All,

I'm developing a little plugin (the first & python-newbie...), which  
parses xml and creates a shapefile. The way it work is similar to the  
"openAdressesConverter" (but using etree, not sax) - there's a little  
dialog asking for the xml-inputpath and the shape-output path. Then click  
"ok" and it creates 2  shapefiles yet. It's just working, but the code  
needs a big refactoring, but in this moment that's a minor matter (not a  
minor matter at all, I know ;)

The things I want to change:
1. There are points and lines in the xml - till now, my code creates for  
every layer a single shape file - is it possible, to save those layers (1x  
pointlayer(or maybe 2x), 1x LineString layer) directly in one shapefile?
I tried qgsVectorLayer like written in the QGIS1.6-tutorial, but I don't  
know how to modify it, because I don't need to use mapCanvas, or  
missunderstood the Class Reference. found some small other samples by  
google, but didn't help.

2. Is there a method for setting the color of line-Layer? the default  
color for the lines should be red at all.

3. the (vector)layer should be added in qgis after creating automaticly,  
so you don't have to do it afterwards. Does it work with a simple "def  
addLayer" in the end of the code, or is there a better way to to it (maybe  
i had a mistake in the code, I tried it with a function using open(path))?

If you have an Idea or if I understood anything wrong , please let me know  
-
I didn't found answers by searching here, if there's a topic about this,  
please give a link.

thanks,
Jens

Most of your questions are answered in the QGIS Python Cookbook. I
would suggest to first read there and then come back to this list if
you have specific queries.

http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/
http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/vector.html#appearance-symbology-of-vector-layers

Good luck!

Regarding the progress function, I have found a much simpler and elegant solution:? 


- call the function GDALGetRasterStatistics(...,bForce=FALSE,...) to get the cached stats (and not force a calculation)

- if the stats are not found, then call GDALComputeRasterStatistics() which supports the progress callback


No need to modify anything in GDAL!? Guess I was braindead a few days ago...


I'll send the code to Tim so he can update the trunk.

Ok for me it seems to recompute the histogram every time (which takes
about a minute+ with the sample data set I sent you). I will update my
gdal svn copy to get your patch for #4183 and see if the problem goes
away.

Ok Martin addressed this in his email in this thread. I basically have
no more authority than anyone else in the community - they evauate
each request based on merit. As Martin mentions, breaking ABI
compatibility will not go down well with them so providing a wrapper
function which adds progress support (or perhaps adding the progress
callback as the last param with a default of void so that it can be
left out will be acceptable to them) would be good.

Hi Volker,

Starting from formal assumptions, this is indisputably true:
Pyspatialite simply is an unpleasant fork of PySqlite.

Anyway reality very often is surprisingly different from 
theory: unhappily, on the vast majority of Linux distros,
PySqlite forbids using SpatiaLite at all, because dynamic 
loading of any external extension is actually disabled.

So standing things, PySpatialite is a mandatory component
for QGIS: it's the unique affordable and reliable Python
connector effectively supporting SpatiaLite on every 
possible platform. and Python plug-ins supporting SpatiaLite 
aren't at all "rare birds" in QGIS.

Hi Paolo,

Thanks for your interest and question.  I think the main reason is to
provide only the GUI elements that people need to do the tasks that the
application is designed to accomplish.  Although many of the users will have
good GIS experience, some may not.  I've found from teaching high school
teachers GIS that even very smart people often have trouble with the complex
interface of QGIS, or other GIS applications. 

You mentioned in a previous post that it was possible to remove menu's etc.
in the new Wroclaw version.  Do you mean you can do this in code through the
plugin interface?  

Thanks,
Bob

Hi Alexander, 

Thanks very much for your reply.  I guess my questions were unclear in my
previous post.  I have been using QGIS for a few years, and I have installed
MrSID support in the past.  My current version of Copiapo came with MrSid
support built in; however, the PyQGIS bindings that came with Copiapo that I
am using to develop my custom app apparently do not have MrSID support (i.e.
the GDAL version used for the PyQGIS bindings does not have MrSID support). 
I have two questions:

1) Do the PyQGIS bindings that come with Wroclaw have MrSID support?
2) Is there any way I can add MrSID support to the PyQGIS bindings?

Thanks,
Bob

Hi Bob, you don't have to do it programmatically, you can setup the gui 
how you want just by using some config files, have a look here [0] (even 
if it looks down at the moment)

Hi Marco,

Thanks for the tip; however, after reading Tim's pages about customizing, I
found that neither the settings>customizing... menu item nor the
configuration files seem to exist on my Windows Vista installation of
Wroclaw.  I believe I used a standalone installer rather than the OSGEO
installer, which might make a difference.

Does the customization capability only exist in the Linux distributions??

Thanks,
Bob

Hi Bob,
I'm not certain, but I think that feature was added after 1.7, so you would need to run a trunk build to get it.
It is not using code - there is a dialogue in which you turn gui elements off and on, and save the settings in an .ini file.

Regards,
Alister

Hi Alister,

Thanks for your reply, and I think you are correct.  I tried installing both
the OSGeo and the standalone version of Wroclaw on Windows Vista, and there
is no "customization" item in the Settings menu.  In addition, there are no
configuration files as described in
http://linfiniti.com/2011/07/batch-customizing-qgis/

Thanks again,
Bob

Message-ID: <1312640532471-6659723.post@n2.nabble.com>

Dear Devs,

I didn't understand that there is a new release of the API with every new
release of QGIS.  I am actually using the version of the API that came with
Copiapo, but I was using the Stable 1.0 API documentation.  Is it worth
adding a sentence or two under the "API Stability" heading for both the
Stable 1.0 and Trunk-2034d59 versions of the documentation to make this
clear?  Perhaps with a link to the latest version of the documentation?

Thanks,
Bob

Hi Bob, I can't remember when th customization feature has ben added but 
i think after 1.7. when you do the os4geo install b sure to chose the 
qgis-dev package. here [0] i've a description on how to do it, just 
ignore the globe part (or actually don't and try out globe as well well :)

ciao Marco

Hello,

I don't know how you do but when I need the trunk api, I do a clone

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After I use doxygen (graphviz is needed too) to generate my API docs
You can find a minimum doc about it at
http://www-scf.usc.edu/~peterchd/doxygen/

So after your clone, you go into Quantum-GIS dir with

--------------------------
cd Quantum-GIS
--------------------------

If you want a particular branch, for example, do a

--------------------------------
git branch final-1_7_0
--------------------------------

and you finish with

---------------------------
doxygen Doxyfile
---------------------------

Go into api_doc and open the browser with

---------------------------
cd api_doc
firefox index.html
---------------------------

At the end, you will no depend from online docs.
I agree that info about the right API version is not well explained so +1 to
add it in docs.

Regards

ThomasG

Oh I think its in master only so probably you should forget it as an
option as it will be a while until it makes it into a stable release.

In general each release we make has the same API as previous releases
but may extend it with new functionality too (i.e. it is intended to
be backwards compatible). There have been one or two cases where we
needed to break backwards compatibility because of a bug in the API
but these cases are isolated. So in theory if you develop something
agains 1.0 it should work against current trunk. Do note that 2.0 (our
next major release) will break API compatibility (though that
compatibility will be maintained through the 2.x release series). If
you find specific instances where the api has bee changed by dropping
methods, please let us know as that should be considered a bug
probably.

Hi Folks

Is anyone else interested in being able to have shields for labels
(e.g. to mark highways etc.). I've made an initial stab at it - you
can see an example and git details in case you want to try it in the
link below. Is there any interest in getting this into trunk? Maybe a
better way of doing things? I thought of using SVG shields but I think
it might be a performance killer if you have many labels and each
needs scaling.

I think that is a good idea and the implementation is in the correct place.
I would like to see it in trunk, as I have a project that already need
something like this.
Yeah I wouldn't use SVG for label stuff, labels need to be as fast as
possible and I think it defiantly would have killed performance.

It does need to account for differing sizes of text 1-4 characters ( at
least I've seen that variety). What about a hybrid system where for a
given symbology set, a static image is generated from SVG+text and then
used for all renderings of it at a given scale and cached for future
use? The ability to create new highway type symbols is fairly important
as that varies widely throughout the world. I could also see symbol
constrained labels in general being an awesome feature.

Look forward to testing, especially pdf/svg export - the label should be
editable (text) but not necessarily the symbol.

Thanks,
Alex

 Hi,

 This would be a very interesting feature - I also needed such a feature 
 for displaying circles below a letter to label specific parts of a 
 multi-geometry feature. I tricked by using Postgis views and rendering 
 the layer multiple times. Your solution would be more elegant.

 Another alternative would be to use the text diagrams. Layer properties 
 --> Diagrams --> Type text diagrams. You can select one or more 
 attributes to be displayed (each attribute a line). But I guess it is 
 more suited to labeling area features than line features.

 Regarding implementation: you should probably consult with Martin and 
 Marco H. because they worked quite a bit with the labeling engine.

 Regarding SVG:

 * why do you think SVG would be too slow? For placement you would not 
 test with SVG but with a rectangle (text bounding box plus some margin). 
 For the sole placement, SVG should be fast enough - we already do it 
 with point symbols and it works fine.
 * Another interesting option would be to use SVG shields and use the 
 SVG parameter syntax, just as Marco recently did with the SVG symbols 
 that allow overriding of fill color, stroke-color and stroke-width 
 (recent trunk). In the SVG file you would define a place-holder text 
 which QGIS would parse and replace the text for the shield with the 
 label. This would allow for a lot of flexibility
 * Alternatively, the support of basic shapes (rects, circles, ellipses) 
 would be interesting and eliminating the need to create an SVG file

 Looking forward to such a new feature.

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Nevertheless, I keep on suggesting to use this feature, and go for a customized QGIS
+ a plugin rather than a full app, because:
- it will be easier to further develop and maintain a plugin than a full app
- new QGIS features will be added straight away as main QGIS progresses
- you can add and remove features to your customized app at will, with maximum ease
- anybody can use even the development version of QGIS, with very little effort
- the development versioon is usually in good shape, and can be used at least for
testing purposes
- it is also very easy to build a standalone installer with your customized QGIS.
All the best.

It seems that libpal is not maintained by the original authors
anymore. I would be happy to see new upstream releases with the
changes we have done in our fork. However the current situation is
quite fine for us because we can do modifications / bugfixes to libpal
whenever needed and do not worry about conflicting versions, ABI/API
stability and other stuff. Therefore I do not think some moves will
happen unless someone starts maintaining upstream libpal.

These are quite small libraries and relativle mature ones (i.e. not
much development is going on), so bundling them in QGIS sources makes
sense. Using them as separate libraries would cause more headache than
fun to users and developers.

Hi Bob

PyQGIS bindings are always compiled with the same GDAL as the
application itself. Please make sure that you are able to open the
mrsid layers from python console in QGIS. If that is possible and in
your custom PyQGIS-based application you cannot load mrsid layers then
you probably have more GDAL versions installed in your system and
wrong GDAL library is picked up. That could be solved by setting
correct library search path.

Hi all.
I'm testing the new browser; a great improvement. A few issues (I'm not sure if I'm

- drag and drop works on the legend, not on the canvas
- it does not work for WMS layers
- WFS are not listed
Furthermore, when dragging a tiff on the legend, QGIS freezes with:
  self.coordXform = QgsCoordinateTransform(renderer.destinationSrs(),
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(4326))
Warning: Object::connect: No such signal QgsGdalProvider::statusChanged( QString ) in

If I'm not wrong the standalone browser also used to show correctly the

one more thing:
- when adding a WMS layer by double-clicking, the layer is loaded on the legend, but
not displayed on the canvas; zooming or panning solves it.
Should I open corresponding tickets?

Nice stuff. If you would like to reuse as much code as possible you
may use marker symbols from symbology-ng to render the shields - both
drawing and GUI would be for free to render SVGs, Font symbols etc.

As I understand labeling with shields, there are typically two cases:
1. short text (e.g. road names D1, E55) - fixed-size shields can be used
2. long text - variable-length background must be used to fit the
text. Usually something simple like rectangles (or rounded rects) are
used. I think some software supports also automatic horizontal scaling
of shields based on symbols, but the results may look weird.

If I am not completely mistaken about the use cases we could use a
combined approach of shields: the user would select either to use
rectangles that scale with text (like in your implementation) and/or
marker symbols (fixed size).

In future we could add uneven scaling of symbols, so these two options
would boil down to one mighty shield implementation ;-)

Btw. I hope that in future we will enhance the style manager so that
it will accomodate not only symbols and color ramps, but also other
assets like label styles and shield styles, so the user could
seamlessly use the favourite ones without having to recreate them all
over again.

 Hi Bastian,

 I advise you to use english on this mailing-list.

 The exact dependency between zoom level, minScale, maxScale, minExtent 
 and maxExtent in OpenLayers is a bit complicated and to be honest I 
 never fully understood it. I also do not understand why OpenLayers needs 
 a zoom level if one uses WMS untiled.

 In the file GlobalOptions you can set "maxScale" and "minScale" in the 
 "MapOptions". In addition, QGIS web client reads the maxExtent from the 
 bounding box of the first layer it hits (which is derived from the WMS 
 settings in the QGIS project properties WMS tab. To be honest I never 
 fully understood why one cannot simply set a zoom Extent in OpenLayers - 
 it somehow gives precedence to some other zoom level or scale settings. 
 You can try experimenting with these values and if you find out 
 something we can fix it in QGIS web client.

 BTW: is the "Full Extent" Button working properly? This one usually 
 works fine for me.

This should be fixed with commit e2c5fe77e8f24d72fd5e. The lack of antialiasing

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis-web-client  Map extent
Message-ID: <1824364794.49634.1312816538040.JavaMail.fmail@mwmweb067>

Hello

Let me tell the problem in English again.
I want to try out qgis-web-client for a webmapping project. For the setup I sticked closely to the readme.txt and so far it is working in general.
The only problem I face so far is the zoom level when the client is started. If I open the QIS Projekt (the standard NaturalEarth example so far) through the web-client the map is zoomed out very far and earth is just a small rectangle in the map window.
I thought that it actually should zoom automatically to the last map extent used in the respective qgis project.
Anyone any ideas how to achieve that?

Thanks for the answer Andreas. The Full Extent Button works, but if you have a map of Europe or Germany in the background and you actually want to display layers for just a small area it won't be of much use.
If the qgis-web-client could read out the extent information form the project file and zoom to it, that would be perfect and someone told me that this actually the way it was intended to work.

Greetings

Bastian

Hi Tim

Cool, shields for labels are very usefull, both with rectangles or with svg 
background (probably in future). 
Rectangular shields are also well suited as a (computationally) fast 
alternative to font buffers.

I didn't yet look into the details of the code. From first tries of the label-
shield branch, it seems to me the shields currently don't appear nicely in 
composer printouts. Probably it needs the consideration of the output device 
resolution.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Setting Up Eclipse to develop with the PyQGIS API
 (reason: MrSID issues)
Message-ID: <1312833509640-6665656.post@n2.nabble.com>

Dear Devs,

I mistakenly first posted this to the archive list by mistake, so please
forgive any duplication. 

I searched the archives and found nothing on this topic, so I am posting
about it.  This may save new PyQGIS developers some time if they work in
Eclipse on MSWindows. 

I couldn't open a MrSID file in a PyQGIS app I am developing using the 1.6
API.  It turned out that the problem was my system environment wasn't
properly configured.  The main QGIS application runs from qgis.bat when
running on windows.  The qgis.bat runs a cascading set of .bat files that
sets a number of environment variables for the duration that QGIS runs. 

I solved my problem by modifying qgis.bat to start eclipse.  Thus all the
needed environment variables are properly set.  The code for the modified
qgis.bat is as follows: 

-------------------------------------------------- 
@echo off 

SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\PROGRA~1\QUANTU~1 
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\o4w_env.bat 
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\gdal17.bat 
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\grass-env.bat 
@echo off 

rem add %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\bin for Copiapo only; Wroclaw has this
setting 
path %PATH%;%GISBASE%\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\bin 
  
start "Eclipse" /B C:\eclipse-SDK-3.6.1-win32\eclipse\eclipse.exe %* 

rem start "Quantum GIS" /B "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\qgis\bin\qgis.exe %* 
rem old eclipse Target C:\eclipse-SDK-3.6.1-win32\eclipse\eclipse.exe 
rem new eclipse Target C:\eclipse-SDK-3.6.1-win32\eclipse_qgis.bat 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
So, just copy qgis.bat to your eclipse directory, rename it as
"eclipse_qgis.bat" and modify it as above (of course edit the path as
necessary to point to your eclipse.exe).  Then set the properties of your
application startup shortcut so that Target points to eclipse_qgis.bat as
indicated in the last 2 rem statements above. 

You still need to configure your project settings and python settings in
Eclipse, but the above should help. 

Thanks to Tim Sutton and Martin Dobias for pointing me in the right
direction! 
...Bob

Hi all.
Thanks Alex for rearranging the Raster menu, much more clear now.
A few questions questions:
* I'm not completely sure Contour should go under Extraction; it does not fit well
anywhere, but I think it is closer to Conversion than anything else. In this case,
the Clipper should go under Miscellaneous.
* Also, the order within submenus is probably best set on the basis of similarity; in
this case, I would place Near black closer to Sieve.
* Moreover, now it could be the right time to add a menu also for
http://www.gdal.org/gdal_fillnodata.html  and
http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/gdal/swig/python/scripts/gdal_calc.py
What others think about these issues?
All the best.

Hi all.
With current master, I get bad performances in loading rasters (a <12Mb takes >5
sec); when double-clicking it from the QGIS browser, it is far slower (>20 sec). From
the console:
Warning: Object::connect: No such signal QgsGdalProvider::statusChanged( QString ) in

Any hint?

Hi Tim

+1 for bringing the shield code into core. I agree with the comments about 
enhancements with marker symbols or scaled svg symbols. These would be great 
additions for the future.

The scaling works for me as follows (It does not need the consideration of the 
raster compress factor, because we are not dealing with the oversized fonts):

if ( drawShield )
    {
      painter->save();

      painter->translate( QPointF( outPt.x(), outPt.y() ) );
      painter->rotate( -label->getAlpha() * 180 / M_PI );
      double scaledSize = lyr.vectorScaleFactor * shieldSize;
      double yMultiLineOffset = ( multiLineList.size() - 1 - i ) * 
lyr.fontMetrics->height();
      painter->translate( QPointF( 0, - lyr.fontMetrics->descent() - 
yMultiLineOffset ) );
      QgsPoint rectPt = xform->transform( label->getX(), label->getY() );
      QgsPoint rectPt2 = xform->transform( label->getX() + label->getWidth(), 
label->getY() + label->getHeight() );
      QPointF origin( double( - scaledSize ), scaledSize + lyr.fontMetrics-
>descent() );
      QPointF corner( double( rectPt2.x()  - rectPt.x() + ( scaledSize * 2 ) 
), double( rectPt2.y() - rectPt.y() - scaledSize + lyr.fontMetrics->descent()) 
);
      
	  if ( mShowingCandidates )
	  {
        painter->setBrush( Qt::red );
        painter->drawEllipse( origin, 3, 3 );
        painter->setBrush( Qt::green );
        painter->drawEllipse( corner, 3, 3 );
	  }
      // draw the shield
      QRectF rect( origin, corner );
      painter->setPen( Qt::NoPen );
      painter->setBrush( shieldColor );
      painter->drawRoundedRect( rect, shieldCornerRounding, 
shieldCornerRounding );
     
      painter->restore();
    }
      

Regards,
Marco

There was a bug with full extent button, when the first layer is 
in a different srs than the map: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3964

I committed a fix today.

Hi Paolo

Does it do that every time you load that layer or only the first time?
Does the filesystem permissions allow writing of gdal .aux.xml files?

My raster stats branch merge changed some behaviours and it is
probably a side effect of that. One of the changes is that gdal gets
full stats when trying to determine the min max of a band. It will
fetch those stats quickly from aux.xml if present of if not its going
to do a full stats gather just for the basic min max stats which is
where you probably experience the slowness. I will see if I can find a
better way to do the basic min/max stats gathering.

Regards

Tim

Hi

Thanks everyone for the feedback. @Marco ok thanks for your hints - I
will apply your suggestions to my branch tomorrow and then merge to
master. In the future if I have time I will look at using svg or
symbology ng for shields (or maybe someone else will beat me to that
:-) ).

Regards

Tim

Hi Paolo, Tim

unfortunately in the last months I had a very little time to follow the
developments, so maybe I will say obvious things.

I just compiled QGIS master under Ubuntu against GDAL 1.8 and when
loading a raster I see the same message

Warning: Object::connect: No such signal
QgsGdalProvider::statusChanged( QString )
in /home/gio/qgis-Quantum-GIS-6a1073f/src/core/raster/qgsrasterlayer.cpp:2446

the practical difference I see is that, as Tim describes, that rasters
are slower to open the first time, but then are faster as before, if not
more. This seems to me not a big deal when opening quite small images,
but it can be when opening multiple images at one time or when adding
very big rasters.

For instance I have 3GB landsat images with overviews that before these
changes opened in a nick of time, now -the first time- they take a few
seconds (10/15).

The same images without overviews before the changes took 10/15 seconds
to open, now -the first time- it takes much more.

Another issue I guess can be if the rasters are stored in a place where
the aux.xml cannot be written.

I guess that the right behaviour is the new one, but maybe it is worth
add an option to avoid collecting stats on raster load?

cheers

This may be fixed via a patch given to me by Etienne Sky - please let

Yes thats why I was asking if the file permissions exist to write the
aux.xml. If they don't behaviour should be the same as prior to my
native raster stats commits i.e. stats will be recalced each time you
open a project / add a layer and trigger something that needs the
stats.

Ok I put a fix for this in master- can you tell me if it improves the situation?

Tim, and others,

By the way, there is a mechanism in GDAL to support storing .aux.xml
information in an alternative directory when the file cannot be
created on the target directory due to permissions, read-only media, etc.

This is enabled by setting the GDAL_PAM_PROXY_DIR option to
point to a directory where files can be written.   If there is a place
known to QGIS that would be good for this, it might make sense
to take advantage of this.

Best regards,

just tested your last commit and I still see

Warning: Object::connect: No such signal
QgsGdalProvider::statusChanged( QString )
in /home/gio/qgis-Quantum-GIS-4b4820e/src/core/raster/qgsrasterlayer.cpp:2446

I copied a geotiff in a folder with no write permissions and it took a
lot of time to open the raster, much more than it used to take when
opening the same image the first time in a folder with write
permissions.

Then I compiled QGIS with your last commit and now it seems it is not
collecting stats/creating the aux.xml file anymore.

cheers

Hi all,

I've updated the wiki page [1] adding the weekly report of the last week.

In this moment the development of the import layer feature for the posgres
provider
is in a pretty good state, I get no error when I compile the code :).
I'm going to test it tomorrow.

Btw, is it possible to call computeMinMax() on demand, e.g. in 
QgsGDALProvider::minimumValue /maximumValue instead of the provider

It probably does not matter much for the desktop experience. However, for 
server throughput, avoidance of opening and parsing the aux.xml file could make 
a difference.

Oh great tip thanks! I have implemented support for this in master /
commit 89ddd03b.

BTW referencing your chat on IRC, AFAIK we are still using the C api
for GDAL everywhere.

It could be a possibility but the way things are set up now, stats are
only gathered when really needed, and if you need then for the
activity you are doing you would have to wait for them anyway. The
only merrit of using a separate thread would be if we decided to start
gathering complete stats on first load of a raster in the background
always so that they are preemptively there when the user does
something that needs stats. However I don't know if that is a good
idea - if you have many rasters in a project that need stats it will
spawn many threads and the IO / CPU overhead may be unpleasant.

I think the overhead for reading the aux.xml file is really minimal
and the min/max population of that if its not there is quite quick and
a once off event so I wouldnt think it is going to impact the server
much. I'd suggest I first run some benchmarks to see how much overhead
it adds.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Breaking API and merge of threading branch
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFcEJvpjgB2PiVpKevoK3MmEBKk7s9ZtN-Wcb3LBFpxQwA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there

watching the recent developments in the master branch I see various
nice improvements. And they have something in common: they do _not_
break API compatibility :-)

I would like to bring up this topic, because we should purge a lot of
cruft and deprecated APIs on the road to 2.0. The reason why I start
this is that I have been closely looking at the merge of threading
branch to master. The changes in that branch are essentially of three
types:
1. asynchronous map rendering (i.e. ability to browse the map while it
is still being rendered)
2. thread-safe API for vector access
3. various speed optimizations

Asynchronous map rendering is relatively simple to merge and requires
only few API changes. But without new API for access to layers it is
possible to produce crashes (e.g. map is still being rendered when you
decide to start editing or do some analysis). The new API for vector
access (using iterators) will require removal of the old API
(select(), nextFeature()) in order to work well. And that means that
virtually any functionality that uses layers' data has to be updated
to new API. We need to break things in order to make threaded
rendering work.

The question is how to proceed and how to communicate that to users.
The procedure could look like this:
- set a date when we will start breaking API compatibility
- create a tag in git that would be the last revision of master branch
compatible with 1.x API
- change plugin manager so that it allows only plugins that say qgis
2.0 is the minimal version for them to run
- change plugin installer so that it works only with new plugin
repository and shows plugins for qgis 2.0

Is there anything else we should consider? The point is to make the
transition as smooth as possible for those using qgis-master.

And what are your opinions when should we start with the breakage...
in a month? in a week? tomorrow? now? :-)

But is there any downside from populating min/max on demand (e.g. like in 
QgsVectorDataProvider::minimumValue / maximum Value)? 

While it's nice to have a minimal overhead (probably buffered by the qgis 
server layer cache in many cases), it would be even better to have 0 overhead.

Marco

I think the fact that we are going to break API in 2.0 is well known
and discussed often in releases, blogs, qgis hackfests etc. and is a
general expectation when performing a major version numbering change.
I think your approach is good (tag last api compatibility etc). As far
as I am concerned we can go ahead with API breakage today. There are a
number of other gut wrenching changes I would like to make for 2.0:

- change theme to 'gis' theme by default
- get rid of kids theme
- rename default theme to 'legacy'
- remove all deprecated api calls

Many parts of our api have developed inconsistencies and I would like
to spend some time putting my 'rpl' binary to good use trying to clean
these up before we release. I think we should continue the practice of
marking new api additions / changes with a @note added in 2.0  or
@note replaces getLayerId in 2.0 etc. as far as possible so that
people can adapt to our changes easily.

Anyway +1 for API breakage from me - we will continue maintaining
1.7.x for now anyway for those looking for stability. The number of
things we can reasonable backport will shrink as we mess with the API
but I don't see the impact to be too big.

Tim

+1 for starting now.  Better to start early so we and plugin devs can start
moving over, esp regarding the multi threading API, then leave it till the
end.

I think we could also generate some kind of report with API changes, see

Ya you make a good point. I will try update it to calculate on demand.

+1 to break API
I think:
- from a power user point of view (and for plugin writers), the largest impact will
be in loosing (and having to rewrite) a lot of plugins, at least for several weeks or
months; for this, I think it is very important to move *before breakage* all the
plugins (if the authors agree) to the new infrastructure, so devs could help each
other migrating to new API
- it would be good to have 1.8 binaries for major distros before the breakage, so
people willing to use new features *and* existing plugins will be happy.
Does this sound reasonable?
All the best.

Hi Martin,  Tim

I'm also in favour of breaking the API right now (it was only per coincidence 
no one did it so far).
At the last developer meeting, someone proposed to have a list wotj the API 
breakages on the wiki as help for plugin authors.

Regards,
Marco

Hi all,

may be it is time to add to the GdalTools plugin new utility
that will calculate raster statistics? Something similar to
Assign projection or Build overviews.

Good idea; ideally this should be done in batch, also recursively, so in most
situations it should be done shortly after installation.
One tip should be added suggesting users to run this tool, and possibly also adding
indexes to large shapefiles, to prepare all their data for fast loading.
All the best.

In my opinion it is better to start now and have more time to update plugins
and test new changes.

So, +1 for breaking API now

Hi Tim-
??? I understand that the stats are only gathered when needed. Still, I think users should have the option to compute stats and possibly other support files on load. This could be accomplished via a preference/setting or a pop-up dialog. In theory, you could have a thread pool to generate the support files in the background. The size of the thread pool could be determined by a user preference/setting.


Just a thought.

Take Care,

Peter

It could be a possibility but the way things are set up now, stats are
only gathered when really needed, and if you need then for the
activity you are doing you would have to wait for them anyway. The
only merrit of using a separate thread would be if we decided to start
gathering complete stats on first load of a raster in the background
always so that they are preemptively there when the user does
something that needs stats. However I don't know if that is a good
idea - if you have many rasters in a project that need stats it will
spawn many threads and the IO / CPU overhead may be unpleasant.

Tim

I think a list of removed / renamed classes and functions on one wiki
page would work best - with suggestions on how to migrate. Plugin
authors then should be able to find out what happened to their
favourite pieces of API.

I do not see a reason for migrating the plugins - this should be a
task of the individual authors. If an author has disappeared but the
plugin is useful, someone will probably start maintaining it and
upload it to the new repository. This is how it works with OSS
everywhere. Let's avoid a massive import of plugins that do not work
correctly due to API changes and without an active maintainer.

We did not really plan to make a 1.8 release. I am a bit afraid that
preparing another release might distract us from the road to 2.0.
Anyway this is a question for the release manager.

Agreed, I did not mean to have a formal release, just a quick snapshot before
breakage. I'm sure someone will find it useful.

I actually meant that the button "add 3rd party repositories" would go
away and the new repository would show up (in new installations). IIRC
this is in line with what we agreed on at hackfest: to encourage
plugin developers to use the new official plugin repository for all
public plugins.

I know we are still missing a simple tool for uploading new versions
of plugins without having to upload them manually - since this was
IMHO the main reason why people preferred to use their own
repositories. But such a tool will not be hard to create - we only
need the plugin repository to provide an API that would authorize the
user and upload the plugin in one step (to avoid parsing HTML pages,
doing authorization etc in several steps).

Hi all,

I had noticed the slow loading you refer to, when I got a copy of the master branch last week,? but it seems to be fixed now.

If you opened a raster from the command-line (i.e. qgis file.tif), the raster stats were fetched (and stored in the .aux.xml file) automatically, hence the delay.


Now the proper behaviour is happening, i.e. the stats are only calculated upon demand (such as when opening the histogram tab).


The "Object::connect: No such signal" problem is unrelated, and I have been seeing it ever since using 1.7.? This should definitely get fixed...

I copied a geotiff in a folder with no write permissions and it took a
lot of time to open the raster, much more than it used to take when
opening the same image the first time in a folder with write
permissions.

Then I compiled QGIS with your last commit and now it seems it is not
collecting stats/creating the aux.xml file anymore.

cheers

I think the Browser is great, but I would suggest to have a way to update directory contents, with either a refresh button/command, or when the user opens a folder after collapsing it.

I'm testing the new browser; a great improvement. A few issues (I'm not sure if I'm

- drag and drop works on the legend, not on the canvas
- it does not work for WMS layers
- WFS are not listed
Furthermore, when dragging a tiff on the legend, QGIS freezes with:

For 1.0 I made a big fat list of all API changes as a series of rpl commands

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/VisualChangelog1.0.0 (scroll down a bit)

This was hopefully useful to people migrating to the new API since you
could more or less run that on your code and it will realign itself to
changed method names. Not perfect but a starting point. Definately
having a list of api changes would be good. I think if we carefully
note them in doxygen, we could probably find a way to pull them all
out similar to the way doxygen will create todo lists for you etc.

Tim

I think the Road graph plugin should be excluded from the targets of buildings when the broken API compatibility. Then, I'll post a patch and fix any problems.

We should wait a day or two. The Debian packages are not yet installed into 
the pool locations (http://incoming.debian.org/) and there are some differences 
to the Ubuntu packages. The Debian people wished to rename some packages. I 
will upload the same version as in Debian to ubuntugis tonight or tomorrow 
night by latest.

Since backwards-incompatible changes are being discussed, may I also suggest
that we update PyQGIS to use version 2 of the SIP apis for QString and
QVariant?

The version 2 API is much more Pythonic and has better support for Unicode
and Python 3. It is also the only version that is compatible with PySide.
Because of this, many GUI components that use the Enthought scientific
python modules are only compatible with version 2 of the SIP APIs. Notable
projects include Matplotlib and IPython.

More information on why using API v2 is a good idea can be found here:

  http://www.pyside.org/docs/pseps/psep-0101.html


Updating to the new SIP API should be a simple matter of adding:

    import sip
    sip.setapi('QString', 2)
    sip.setapi('QVariant', 2)

To the startup routine for the Python kernel before any PyQt libraries are
added. All Python plugins that use QString or QVariant would have to replace
these with plain Python strings and dicts.

Thoughts?

I have but two questions for this thread, and it's more a user question than a developer question (and if I thought like the later, I'd probably be able to answer it myself).

I recall discussion of a 1.7.1 backport type release, to cover the major bugs that weren't sorted in time for the 1.7 release.
Is that still on?
If so, does this affect the possibility of a 1.7.1 release?

Just curiosity. 1.7 is doing a good job of what I need it for - so many thanks.

Yes I will be announcing release plans for 1.7.1 probably over the weekend.

No. And we will do follow up 1.7.2 etc releases until 2.0 and maybe
beyond. But the number of things that we can reasonably backport to
the 1.7 branch will reduce as the two versions diverge.

Yes, I would like to do this change during the development of 2.0.

Another python related change in my todo list is to move plugin
metadata out of __init__.py file to a text file.

Hi Marco,

It seems that qgis android spatialite is still off.

-DWITH_SPATIALITE=OFF
https://github.com/mbernasocchi/qgis-android/blob/master/scripts/build-qgis.sh

Spatialite depends on libiconv and libcharset

Have you seen this?

Hi Tim,

I'm wrong or after the last commits QGIS is not gathering raster stats
anymore?

At least in my box the aux.xml files are not created anywhere.


Cheers

Hi, 

sorry if it not exactly related, but a few months ago it was committed
by Marco a "Zonal Statistic" plugin (that is still missing the toolbar
icon) that is available under Windows but it does not show under
Debian/Ubuntu. I guess it needed to change debian/control also in this
case.

They should be.

> At least in my box the aux.xml files are not created anywhere.

Try going to the histogram tab of your raster properties or do
something else that requires stats. In many cases, stats are not
needed so you may not be seeing thm gathered. Also for read only
medai, the stats should land up in the proxy dir which is set to
~/.qgis/gdal_pam. Otherwise can you give me a specific procedure to
follow to replicate?

With 880540ba, J?rgen has added both plugins to the Sid package, thanks!
osgearth in Ubuntu Lucid, Maverick and Natty is now updated to the same 
package version as Sid. So if the Sid deb is working, these Ubuntu packages 
could be updated, too.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Export MAPINFO: field DATE,DATETIME, ...
Message-ID: <CA+biy=_-UbiB7QpYjq3zy0d8WKNpMQq69n20BpmEjFCMTWjhYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was wondering why, in qgis 1.7, while saving an open mapinfo file as
another mapinfo file, some fields are transformed:
DATE, DATETIME, ...

ex: mapinfo(DATE)->QGIS(DATE)->save as... mapinfo -> MAPINFO(TEXT)

Is there a way to do that using QGIS Python API ?

My goal was to export a layer (pyqgis), as a mapinfo layer, conserving the
exact structure.

Another question: the date was originally like  11/02/2010 in mapinfo and
becomes 2010/02/11 in QGIS, why?

Romain,

As far as I know this is a limitation of the MapInfo ogr driver that QGIS
uses http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_mitab.html


Mainly this section:

Only Integer, Real and String field types can be created. The various list,

I'm sure it could be patched to support datetime, just need to find someone
willing to do it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using the power of GPU/OpenCL
Message-ID: <20de754f-326d-43ef-b268-b31b3a4c9ebc@email.android.com>

Hi,

Now that Martin is including Multithreading Support, I am also wondering if it would be feasible to also profit from the computing power of GPUs and libraries, such as OPENCL. Seems like mobile devices, servers and regular desktops would benefit. Would the Qgis architecture allow the usage of OpenCL?

I am not a dev, but am reading about these new technical options ...

Any thoughts?

Hi all.
In Debian unstable, qwt5 -py has been dropped, and AFAICT perspectives we have to
move to qwt6 (no py available yet). As a consequence, the profile tool plugin
(possibly others?) is no longer working. Any plan to fix this?
I've also noticed the recent Export profile plugin: does it take only 2 points, as
per the notice, or there are more, as it appears from the exported file? Also, I have
inspected the xml result, and tags are in German. Finally, how best use the xml to
display elevation?
Thanks.

If you mean the profile plugin in the sourcepole repo: it does not do 
visualisation, only xml export. The xml format is the one of a cablecar 
planning software, that's why the tags are in german.
However, it could be extended to write to other formats as well.

As input, the plugin needs a selected line (normally a two-point profile line). 
The number of points in the ouput file is determined by the given sampling 
distance and elevation tolerance.

Regards,
Marco

Given that more and more computers come with powerful GPUs it really
makes sense to explore what are the possibilities for speed
improvements. In general you can either use a library that implements
some algorithms on GPU or you can start writing your own GPU code for
the algorithm (or some parts of it).

The speedup will vary greatly depending on the algorithm. Things like
3D rendering, image processing, video compression etc. are perfectly
suited for GPU implementation because one computationally intensive
routine is used in parallel for millions of independent pixels.
However many other algorithms will not perform better on GPU. These
are typically the ones that are not parallel or their bottleneck is
not in computation - many algorithms have bottlenecks in I/O or they
need to wait for some resources.

First we would have to identify what is slow and should be optimized.
Then do some profiling to find out in what parts most of the time is
spent. If those parts are computationally intensive and parallelizable
then it is a candidate for GPU implementation. My impression is that
there are very few places in QGIS where we would gain performance with
GPU because typically we delegate computation to underlying libraries
and/or the slowness is caused by I/O. And various pieces of
functionality are slow just because inefficient or naive algorithms
are used.

When implementing an algorithm on GPU we still would need to provide
original implementation if no OpenCL-capable device is found. So this
adds additional burden on maintainance to ensure that both CPU and GPU
implementations give equivalent results.

To summarize: yes, it would be possible to use GPU for some tasks, but
GPU is not a magic wand. Computationally intensive tasks really can be
improved (even by factors of 100), but many other tasks would not get
faster.

What are the areas where you think QGIS should be faster?

 Since PAL is now more or less a QGIS only feature, would an 
 opencl/multithread path be an improvment ?

 On the lib side, the work on opencl's use in gdal for resampling is a 
 cool point too.

Hi All,

As was stated before,
the real art about making use of OpenCL is not so
much learning the API, but understanding how
to parallelize your algorithms. One of the big
challenges therefore is that you need to learn
OpenCL and parallel programming in -- well --
parallel!

Essentially, whenever you see a chance to process
data in segments, and don't have to process all of
it in one go, there is a good chance that you
can get major speed-ups out of OpenCL. I would think
that this applies to a lot of raster processing.

Luckily, there is (finally) a thorough
and very understandable text book coming up:

http://www.manning.com/scarpino2/

This has all the information on the topic 
in one place. It's been written with C/C++
coders in mind. I have been part of the review
process for this book, so don't take my recommendation
as unbiased!

OpenCL, btw., is not just for GPUs. It is a parallel
programming framework that also covers (multi-core)
CPUs, so it can fallback on those boring things if
no GPUs are available. In that case your code
might suffer from (minor) API overhead, but it should 
not be necessary to have separate versions of the code.

Cheers,

Ben

Hi all,

Thanks all for your answers.

My idea was that one could speed up rendering by rendering layers in
parallel (in cores and or cpus). Often, QGIS projects consist of 25 to
100 layers.

As I understand - QGIS, until recently (until Martins new patch) - would
render one layer after the other in the order they appear in the
project. At the end it would do the label placement. Is parallel
rendering already part of your multithreading patch, Martin? Would it be
possible to render individual layers in parallel and then do the
compositing at the end?

Automatic labeling is obviously something that could use more speed -
but I am not sure if this could be done in parallel. I think it is
more a serial process. One needs the previous candidates for new
candidates to test against. But maybe it could be done in parallel with
other rendering and maybe it would run faster on a GPU? Just mere
speculation.

Obviously, raster processing would be a candidate for segmentation and
parallelization and maybe certain interpolation methods that work with a
smaller window of local points and not on the whole dataset at once.

Not really. PAL has a performant engine for label placement, but in
various places it implements naive versions of some algorithms used in
extraction of label candidates and that ruins the performance
completely. The answer is to use more sophisticated algorithms. Of
course one can try to optimize the speed of naive algorithms by
running them on GPU, but that is not the real solution.

Right, as of now layers are rendered one by one following the order.
The rendering branch renders the layers in parallel to separate images
and then composes them together in right order.

The automatic labeling works like this:
1. while rendering vector layers: features are registered to PAL
2. when rendering of layers has finished:
  2a. extract label candidates for features and estimate their cost
  2b. solve the labeling problem given the candidates
  2c. draw labels

>From my experience 2a is the (only) slow part of the process, while
the focus of PAL authors was to have fast step 2b.

Evaluation of cost of label candidates for polygons is maybe the most
inefficient part, leading to major. I have some ideas how to improve
that, but not enough free time to work on that.

I would stress the importance of this: in our experience, this and the handling of
complex layers (addressed in the work of Martin) are the main cases where speed is a
real issue.
Any dev taking it?
All the best.

I use PyQwt5 compiled from sources and don't notice any problems. 
Unfortunately it seems to be only compatible with Python 2.5 & 2.6, while my 
Qgis is currently compiled against 2.7, so I can't ensure it's working today 
;) 

Maybe I don't understand you, but I don't see any other way to fix it, while 
there is no package available...

No problem to add support for PyQwt6 when it's available for me (=for Debian).

[sorry for crossposting]

Dear hackers,

this is the first announcement of the new converter for
ArcGIS MXD-files to UMN MapServer Mapfiles - MXD2map.

The converter is currently under heavy development, so you are warned.

This converter is able to create runnable UMN MapServer configuration
files from ArcGIS MXDs. This comes handy when publishing OWS-services
directly from your ArcGIS-desktop environment.

Within the next months we will publish a one-click-installer and some
sample-testcases for demonstration as well.

This mail is intended for the GIS-hackers who want to try and give us
some feedback

All needed information about licences, documentation,
mailinglists, sourcecode and professional support etc. an be found on
the website at

	http://www.mxd2map.org

Subscribe to the mailingslist[0] and let us know what you think about
the project.


Enjoy - we love to hear your feedback.

	Stephan Holl, on behalf of the MXD2map-team.

libosgearth-dev is already a build dependency. Did you run "sudo apt-get 
build-dep qgis"?

I'm running:

Compilation goes smoothly, not asking for osgearth, but packaging stops with an error

That because of the support for multiple distributions in our debian/.

The general debian/control is replaced with debian/control.sid when building,
but dpkg-buildpackage only checks debian/control for build dependencies.

If the package is build in two steps, first building a source package and then
compiling that (like the nightly builds do using pbuild/cowbuilder), that
problem doesn't arise as the general debian/control is enough to build the
source package and the source package contains the replaced debian/control
version - therefore the dependencies including osgearth are fetched for sid then.

And we can't put osgearth to the generic debian/control as it's not available for
all distributions.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Use of PyQt QThread in QGIS Plugin
Message-ID: <4E4660E6.2010700@kappasys.ch>

Hi

I'm playing with use of PyQt QThreads in a plugin. But I'm not 
successful. I created a very simple plugin with the aim to understand 
the threading mechanisms of PyQt. The GUI collects number of iterations 
and the thread does nothing else than to iterate over this number. When 
I start the iteration process sometimes it works, but very slow. 
Sometimes the result will appear after closing and reopening the GUI. 
I'm a little bit confused about these results. I appended the plugin. 
Maybe someone outside is able to help. I would appreciate an hint or help.

Regards
Horst

Message-ID: <1313265170.2721.1615.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

I just started to play around with the Globe plugin and I'm noticing the
following:

it works much better on a Windows 7 Virtual Machine rather than on a
Ubuntu 64 bit installation (on a pc with an integrated video card and a
Intel i3 cpu). In fact on the Linux platform it is not smooth at all and
it can't be used.

on both platforms I noticed it is pretty unstable, it is just enough to
close the globe window and relaunch the plugin a few times to get
crashes.

How/what I have to report to help debug this issues?

cheers

Strange things happen to Plugin Installer under Debian last weeks. Paolo 
reported another error, and I'm not able to run the main windows because of 
quite mysterious error:

TypeError: expected 1 arguments, got 0

It's raised when calling various method of various widgets: clearing one 
qcombobox (but adding items to it goes smooth), adding items to another 
qcombobox (but clearing this one goes smooth), selecting items in qlistwidget 
etc.

Debian unstable, 
SIP 4.12.3-1
Python both 2.6 & 2.7
PyQt 4.8.3
Qt 4.7.3

Does anybody have any idea?

Hi all,
I've updated the wiki page [1] adding the weekly report.

This week I've completed the import layer for the postgres provider.

To try this feature you need to checkout the branch import_layer [2] on
my GitHub repository.
I've also added the python bindings, so see at the wiki [1] to know how
to run it from python console.

Any tests and comments are very welcome.
Thanks to all you guys for your support.

Regards.

Message-ID: <51007C77-585F-47EF-9795-F90C42CAED5E@kyngchaos.com>

Well, I've finally made it to QGIS in my Lion upgrade.  QGIS compiled for Snow Leopard seems to work fine on Lion, though it will continue to use Python 2.6.  As for Lion compilation and use, some notes...

- default llvm compiler seems to work fine.

- git is now installed with Xcode.

- (not really Lion-only - all OSX versions) cmake 2.8.5 is broken for detecting Qt4 frameworks.  Fixed in dev, so until 2.8.6 is released use 2.8.4.

- Apple dropped libfcgi and mod_fastcgi from their distribution, so anyone that wants to use the QGIS mapserver needs to install them separately.  I'll try to do something in my QGIS packages.  Is fastcgi an absolute technical requirement, other than just for performance?  Can the code be adjusted to run as a normal cgi?

- Python 2.7 in Lion!

- QGIS compiles with Qt 4.7.3, but there are harmless warnings about not being supported on Lion.  No problems at runtime.

For future packages I have a plan described on my site news.  Briefly: one package to work on both Snow Leopard and Lion (with python 2.6/2.7 switching based on system version), one package for Leopard until all the PPC Macs where I work are replaced (not that we really use QGIS much), maybe sooner if maintaining a Leopard dev Mac becomes too troublesome.

I may start using an installer package for 1.8 dev and beyond.  I'm still trying to figure out if I can bundle osg[earth] (issue locating bundled osg plugins).  I would need an installer to install osg outside the QGIS application.  An installer may also be needed to switch pythons for the system version.  This would also make it possible to create an all-in-one installer, though the parts would be installed in a couple different locations.

Short answer: Reports like this _do_ help.
Long answer:
The globe plugin is currently not in a stable state for many configurations. 
There are configurations which work quite good, but others definitevely not.
The globe started as a research project and Marco Bernasocchi extended it for 
his master thesis. But several places need a review and maybe a rewrite to 
bring the globe to a stable state.
In spite of that I decided to integrate it into QGIS master branch, to give 
packagers enough time for their non-trivial task. In the weeks after adding 
the globe plugin to the master branch, my main work was packaging osgearth for 
Debian and supporting others in building the globe plugin with its 
dependencies.
In the meantime, the two well maintained and stable base libraries got major 
updates. OpenSceneGraph (OSG) is available in version 3.0.1 and OsgEarth will 
shortly be available in version 2.1.

The following aspects of the globe should be reviewed for stability:
1. Multithreaded QGIS core: The globe was developed based on Martins threading 
branch. Since there are now basic locks to avoid parallel rendering, the globe 
can be run without a multithreaded QGIS core.
2. OSG-QT OpenGL adapter: The original QT adapater from OSG got updates 
in the meantime.
3. OSG version compatibility: Some stablity problems could be caused by 
specific library versions.
4. Dynamic layer configuration: OSGEarth support for adding, updating and 
deleting (DEM or QGIS tile) layers dynamically is improving. QGIS globe should 
be adapted to the newest OSGEarth version.
5. Plugin startup and cleanup: There are problems on startup (window for 
OpenGL capability detection e.g.) and in cleaning up after layer updates or 
closing the globe window.

Currently there is a ongoing discussion about funding most of this work. If we 
get some funding, we will start to work soon on these stability issues. If 
not, we will work on it on occasions like the QGIS Developer Meeting in 
November.

But to come back to your question: Yes, do report issues on 
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues with category 'Globe' and 
report working configurations to the list or me. But do not spend too much time 
and energy in it and keep cool if the globe brings your machine to its knees 
or crashes QGIS. I promise to work on stability issues before releasing it.
When reporting issues, please install the osgearth binaries and add the output 
of 'osgearth_version --caps' to your report and don't forget to mention your 
OS and OpenSceneGraph version.

Regards
Pirmin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Feature request Zoom out variably
Message-ID: <1313351150883-6685557.post@n2.nabble.com>

The zoom out tool could maybe be improved by working more like
ArcMap/Mapinfo.
I find it very useful to be able too zoom out much or little depending on
how big "zoom box" I draw with the zoom out tool.
In ArcMap it works like this: A large zoom-box makes a small zoom out. A
small zoom-box makes a big change in scale.
And I really want to congratulate all developers on a really impressive
GIS-tool, and the speed of development is amazing,

all the very best,

Good to hear it is working. I will try to test that soon.

Please implement the support also for OGR provider - that should boil
down to just a few lines of code when using QgsVectorFileWriter. In
QGIS 2.0 we could move the code of this class to OGR provider and then
remove that class. One more thing to consider for the importLayer
functionality: providers may need some provider-specific options -
e.g. in OGR this would be the name of the driver. That could be passed
in another optional key-value parameter (QMap<QString,QString> ?)

If you ever want to use 2.8.5, here is the relevant patch that will fix the
Qt Framework issues:


http://cmake.org/gitweb?p=cmake.git;a=patch;h=702538eaa3315f3fcad9f1daea01e6a83928967b

Apply before building CMake and everything should be good to go.

 Hi Lasse,

 Can you please register this feature request at

 Ideally you can provide some details, or even better already know a 
 developer who can work on it ;-)

 I'm not sure exactly how the new visible extent changes depending on
the size of the box draw when a user draws a rectangle with the
zoom-out tool. What I'd like to see is that after drawing a box then
the view changes so that the pre-zoomed extent is now enclosed within
the drawn box. This isn't currently what happens.

 Is that what other zoom-out mechanisms do? Time to go play with some
other graphics packages...

What happens if it does not work? And how would you quantify the slowness?

This could be caused by the buffering mechanisms on standart output.
Maybe you will have more luck using standart error stream (stderr)
which should not be buffered - or by flushing the stream.

I have modified the code a bit so that I could run it without QGIS.
Everything worked as expected. I have attached the modified dialog
file - check out whether it will work better when run from outside
QGIS.

When developing a zoom out tool for our now-about-defunct SWF-based
gis GUI we used an inverse box, shrinking from the full viewport
around a center defined by the mouse button press.
The more you moved your mouse away from that center, the more the
new viewport indicator (zoom box) would shrink.

That way you have a visual representation of where your
current viewport would end up being. And you ensure that a point
of interest doesn't move (the initial click point).

Hello

This week I have implemented Range parameters and tried to implemented
the SAGA's raster output. To do this I have tried to solve various
issues, mostly regarding specifying grid systems to the module. I have
implemented a widget that allows the user to set a custom grid system
and mechanisms to take the grid system from the input grids. The
efforts haven't been enough, tough, SAGA modules keep outputting
invalid rasters. A discussion concerning this issue is going on at the
saga-gis-developer mailing list[1]. I hope that with a little help
I'll be able to solve this during this week.

Additionally I have solved a few bugs concerning plugin
initialization, string parameter conversion and GUI issues.

The list of pending issues has been moved to the tracker provided by
github[2], in preparation of further work after end of the GSoC
project.

In case you are interested in testing the --still very experimental--
project, a short document explaining installation and basic usage is
now available through the wiki[3].

As said, for next week, raster output implementation is of top
priority. While this gets sorted out I'll complement the code's
documentation, in particular the processing framework's.

This and earlier reports can be read at the usual page[4].

Camilo

Hi all.
If I define a field for label rotation, nothing happens. If I move a label, then it
takes into account the rotaion value. I suspect this is a bug. Anybody confirms?

Furthermore, I cannot select labels with the rotation tool, and once rotate, not even
with the Move label tool (only with the Change label).

Hi Paolo

This is intentional. There are two label modes:

1. automatic placement

2. fixed placement

The first option assumes the position (including rotation) is fully handled by 
PAL.

second option: position / rotation comes from user. As soon as you move a 
label, this mode is active.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco.
Thanks for explaining. I still miss a point: if I select a rotation field with
automatic placement, why labels are not rotated?

Because rotation is part of placement (and done automatically if in automatic 
mode). There was a GUI restriction in the dialog that prevented selecting a 
rotation field without data defined position. Not sure if it is still there.

oh, now I see. in this case I think we should add the option to Label properties

Of course, after SL provider the next one is OGR. I think I'll complete both

tasks in the next few days.
The GSoC coding period is going to end this week and I want complete
that feature before the pencil down date.

One more thing to consider for the importLayer

QgsVectorFileWriter also takes other parameters i.e. creationOptions and
layerOptions, both QStringList.

Probably a QMap<QString, QStringList> could be a better choise to handle
with all them.
Do you agree with me?

Good. I hope you will also manage to make use of this new
functionality in database manager, otherwise it would be visible only
to developers...

Then QMap<QString, QVariant> maybe makes even more sense since
QVariant can accommodate anything including lists.

Hi all.
Running pdf production in Simple print cannot be stopped. If one restart the plugin
when it is writing a pdf, creating a new grid, QGIS obviously crashes:
...

I think a safer method to stop a job and not to overlap two jobs should be implemented.
All the best.

Hi Paolo

is the spatialite database empty at the beginning? Did it work properly
before? Or do you use it the first time?

.qgis/python/plugins/dimensioning/sqlite/

There are several sqlite databases. Looking at the size of them I guess
that the active one (dimension.sqlite) is not empty. Try to copy
dimension.sqlite.template to dimension.sqlite.

Selecting the min-max level for raster transparency works well with the slider; it

Anyone confirms? Should I open a ticket?

A few days ago I sent a message asking about the contributed plugins
projects on the QGIS tracker, and I had no answers. I feel the necessity
of such projects to open many bugs about plugins as probably many others
do.

What is the drill here? Can I open the projects and then "give" them to
the proper author/users?

Cheers

Hi Paolo,
Just to be clear: you are talking about the RasterTransparency plugin
from the GIS-Lab Repository, aren't you?
I imagine you are right: with QGIS trunk on Windows there is only an
error message if you try to use the slider, but using the spinbox
doesn't seem to do anything (there is no error message).

I'm working on a new Mac dev package and thought I clean up the license files in the package.  I vaguely remember some recent discussion about GPLv3.

I currently have a GPLv2 license.  And a copyright license file from 2004 that mentions GPLv2 and includes the Qt-GPL exception paragraph, but I can't find anything equivalent in the current sources.

In the source I find that the top level README says GPLv3, but the COPYING file is GPLv2.

Sorry, I don't know.  Like a lot of plugins, I can't see any relevant
trackers for it, so I guess you need to contact the developers directly.

Hi, I am a current maintainer of 'Google Layers' plugin.
I would like to propose dropping it in favor of 'OpenLayers' plugin,
which is doing the same thing in much better way. Personally I use
'OpenLayers' too and I recommend it to all users interested in loading
Google maps.
The second reason could be legal. 'OpenLayers' plugins suites better
also in this case.

Anybody complains ?

I think it's a good thing to reduce such redundancy which only confuses new

Looking further into saga api I have finally a bit clearer idea of
what is happening there.

There are "modules" and "grid modules". Interactive modules are not
interesting for us right now. Grid modules are an extension of normal
modules - they have a global grid system. Grid system basically means
size of the grids. Grid system is used to enforce that input/output
layers have the same dimensions so that the modules do not have to
handle their compatibility by themselves.

Interesting parameters:
1. CSG_Parameter_Data_Output. Used e.g. in import modules. This
parameter does not carry any input data and is not shown in saga gui
in module's properties - it is strictly for output. Its
Get_DataObject_Type() method determines whether it will contain a
grid, shapes or some other object. saga only sets a special value
DATAOBJECT_CREATE as its value before executing a module.
2. CSG_Parameter_Grid: Used widely for both input and output. By
default this parameter is grid system dependent, that means it must be
compatible with module's global grid system. This parameter has always
a grid system as a parent (the parent grid system is implicitly
created for the parameter if there isn't one). When the parameter is
for input, a grid should be created and loaded with data (with
compatible grid system). When the parameter is for output, an empty
grid instance can be passed - alternatively an existing grid may be
passed which will be overwritten.

Typically a grid module has one or more input and output grids - they
have a common (module's global) grid system.

Camilo: if you still struggle with invalid raster output then try to
pick a module and create a small python script that sets its
parameters, executes the module and saves the output - without
anything QGIS specific. Such a script may help you to understand the
semantics of saga api and if problems persists it is easier to post
such a script to saga-gis-devel list for help than pointing to
qgis-specific implementation where it is not completely clear what is
set and what is not.

I have tried "lectures/01: my first module" and while it says that the
module execution succeeded, it complains that
"/tmp/saga-qgis96159568.sgrd is not a valid or recognized raster data
source". Indeed that file does not exist.


Then I wanted to load some grids... loading from GDAL requires data
object list, so I took a simpler module: "import from image". However
it also leads to errors:

1. error when opening the module:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/martin/.qgis/python/plugins/processingplugin/panel.py",
line 82, in onItemActivated
    dialog = Dialog(self._iface, item.module())
  File "/home/martin/.qgis/python/plugins/processingplugin/dialog.py",
line 48, in __init__
    self.rebuildDialog()
  File "/home/martin/.qgis/python/plugins/processingplugin/dialog.py",
line 63, in rebuildDialog
    for param, value in self.moduleinstance.parameters().items():
  File "/home/martin/qgis/inst-master/share/qgis/python/processing/moduleinstance.py",
line 49, in parameters
    self.module().parameters()]
  File "/home/martin/.qgis/python/plugins/saga/plugin.py", line 240,
in parameters
    self.addParameter(params.Get_Parameter(j))
  File "/home/martin/.qgis/python/plugins/saga/plugin.py", line 167,
in addParameter
    qgisParam.setValue(0)
AttributeError: ChoiceParameter instance has no attribute 'setValue'

I have solved that by removing the line where setValue() is called on
a parameter.

2. an error when chosen an input image file:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/martin/.qgis/python/plugins/saga/plugin.py", line 204, in
    lambda x: self.onParameterChanged(qgisParam, sagaParam, x))
  File "/home/martin/.qgis/python/plugins/saga/plugin.py", line 229,
in onParameterChanged
    sagaParam.Set_Value(value)
  File "/home/martin/inst/saga-bin/lib/python2.7/site-packages/saga_api.py",
line 3895, in Set_Value
    def Set_Value(self, *args): return
_saga_api.CSG_Parameter_Set_Value(self, *args)
NotImplementedError: Wrong number of arguments for overloaded function
'CSG_Parameter_Set_Value'.
  Possible C/C++ prototypes are:
    Set_Value(CSG_Parameter *,int)
    Set_Value(CSG_Parameter *,double)
    Set_Value(CSG_Parameter *,void *)
    Set_Value(CSG_Parameter *,wchar_t const *)

It helped to handle PathParameter in the same way as StringParameter.

3. error executing the module. Even if the module execution succeeded
the output data object(s) would not be saved or imported to qgis
because it does not provide support for data object output parameters.

Hi,

Thanks for reporting this issue. Already fixed in 0.1.5.

Sorry for delay, but I'm currently busy with two large projects
and have some problems with free time

Thanks

exactly, I think we should do the same for several others.
Perhaps adding a tag "deprecated"?
leaving the code available could be good for historical and study purposes, not for
regular uses.
the same applies to several "test plugins" available through various repos.
who can take this?
all the best.

Hi all

After several months, I'd like to open the discussion again and suggest to 
merge Mayeuls patch into the master branch as well (currently only in 1.7, see 
also https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/26)

While a rule based renderer following SLD logic would be great in the future
, the symbol level patch exists and can be very usefull until a redesigned 
renderer is there.

Any objections?

Regards,
Marco

No objections from me... I still hope to redesign the renderer before
2.0, let's see when it will really happen :-)

confirmed, it works, thanks.
still, the problem of where to open external plugins-related tickets remains, and
IMHO is an important one.

Nice progress.

Btw. the customization is meant for "hard" simplification of GUI, that
is someone prepares a customized version of QGIS where some
functionality is disabled. What you probably want to do is to show
just few important toolbars by default and hide the advanced ones.
Desktop QGIS is also packed with too many toolbars when first started,
so I believe hiding advanced toolbars would be helpful for both mobile
and desktop version. When a toolbar is hidden, it can still be shown
again by right clicking dock area in main window or from menu. But
when a toolbar is disabled in customization, you would have to restart
qgis to make it appear again.

During QGIS initialization the customization routines simply remove
some menus, toolbars, actions in menus/toolbars, dock widgets and
status bar widgets from the main window GUI. Note that they are not
deleted completely, only removed from the main window. For details
please have a look at QgsCustomization::updateMainWindow() in
src/app/qgscustomization.cpp.

I hope the same too, but I'll work on it only after the import layer feature

is also available for the OGR provider.

I added an optional param QMap<QString, QVariant> named options,
unused in PG and SL.

Tests and comments are very welcome!

Hi devs,

I've completed the Import layer feature for both PG, SL and OGR provider
(the last one done by using QgsVectorFileWriter).
You can find it in my QGis fork on GitHub, see [1].

The GSoC 2011 coding period will end on 22 Aug.
As suggested by Martin, I would spend the latest following days to improve
DBManager adding the support for that new feature, so the import layer
feature
will be available also for users.

Regards.

Thank you.

> Sorry, can't reproduce with layer and external shapefile

May this be due to the lack of a .prj? Which files should be selected in this case?
If I select all (shp, shx, dbf, prj)
Operation can't be complited:
`/home/Documenti/Didattica/Corsi_Formazione_Faunalia/QGIS/Dati_corso_QGIS/province_multi.dbf'
not recognised as a supported file format.
Furthermore, the selector does not remember last directory used.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CA+biy=-srdCoOOSx2knQP7dmOp8tV0aOp9ZHQ2VNPmbV2eSAVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I know that QGIS is able to load csv, txt and Sqlite tables (no geometry)
via 'Load vector layer'.
I wonder how to do this with pyqgis ?  (the cookbook only describe loading
spatial data).

My goal is to Load a non geometric spatialite table, which is exactly the
same as an sqlite table, in QGIS via python.
I've tried by replacing: uri.setDataSource(' ', table, geomField, ' ',
idField)   by uri.setDataSource(' ', table, ' ', ' ',  ' ') but it doesn't
work...

I guess I've missed something

Thanks in advance,
Romain,

Hi all.
Thanks to Camilo, the analytical framework is now working, and many SAGA modules can
be run smoothly from QGIS. See:
https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki/Module-Support
https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki/Tested-Modules
Still several important things to do, but the structure is in place.
Now we have to think about human interface. One thing is: which terms should be used?
SAGA uses "grid", whereas QGIS uses "raster". To me, the idea is to have a consistent
GUI in QGIS, so better use the QGIS terms not to scare off our users, but this could
be confusing for previous SAGA users. I see this as a minor problema, but I may be wrong.
Your comments will be appreciated.
All the best.

Hi!
Hmm - for german translations grid is - as well as raster - translated 
as Raster .. so there should be no Problem ..
For the english version:
What about leaving grid as grid whenever it is used in SAGA-Modules (so 
you know that you are using a SAGA-Module) and using raster as usual in 
all other places?
Don't know if thats a good idea ..
Or write grid/raster when it is used in SAGA-Modules ..

just as some suggestions ..

regards
Werner

Also please note that SAGA "grid" is actualy a "raster band" in QGIS
terminology, since one raster layer could contain several bands.

If you'll pardon a user intruding (again).

I think Werner's point is valid, ie. if you're using the SAGA modules, then presumably you know what is meant in SAGA by "grid".

But,
If you were going to select one, then please use raster.
In my work situation, I find myself having to clarify what sort of thing I mean by grid far to frequently to want to introduce a another one.

-ramon.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Updating to psycopg2.4.2 ?
Message-ID: <4E4E1120.5050901@gmail.com>

Hi,

I notice there is avaliable a new psycopg2.
http://initd.org/psycopg/articles/2011/06/12/psycopg-242-released/

Should be effort to update the osgeo4w package to this new version ?
Some QGIS plugins need psycopg2.

I see this new version has some enhancement with PG 9.0
as reported here.

This is why I'm asking: I think in this way the users will be confused: imagine
running an hillshade analysis, once calling the original DEM "raster" and the other
"grid".

> Or write grid/raster when it is used in SAGA-Modules ..

This could be cumbersome, as the word is repeated in most modules, sometimes several
times each.
Thanks for your thoughts.

True, even though:
- most analyses will result in single band rasters, so terms will converge
- the use of "grid" is unwarranted in any case - with the same argument, one could
use "raster band".
All the best.

The plugin is meant to add SAGA functions to QGIS, so our main target should be QGIS
users, not SAGA ones, I guess. However, life shouldn't be too difficult for anyone.

Hi All, especially J?rgen :)

J?rgen, could you please review the present state in OsGeo4W and tell whether 
it is possible to make it working out of the box? What is missing? Maybe just 
a patch for Apache package? How many people and how much money do you need? :) 
I don't have any yet, but it would be a good starting point. Could you look at 
it?

More and more users ask me about running the Server under Windows. Recently 
we gained the howto [1], however I don't know any case where it worked (except 
the case itself of course) :((

I believe we should be interested in helping small offices/organizations with a 
Windows server only to introduce the Server and build a QGIS system. 
Othwerwise, we should remove the Server from Windows builds and clearly state 
it's designed for Unix family only. The present situation makes an 
unproffesional impression, that we release something, that maybe works, maybe 
not...

Where did you get this impression that QGIS (Map) server does not work
in Windows.
QGIS (Map) server works in Windows before it works in Linux and Mac OS X.

Have a look at this site (below). It is done in Windows first before
Ubuntu and Mac OS X.

If you download the QGIS (Map) server manual from the link below. The
screenshots in manual done are in Windows.

Hi Noli

The material on karlinapp is older than that on the wiki. Yes, there was a 
MingW compiled version used for teaching, but it is not current state of the 
software. 
It is better to go the osgeo4w way with visual studio compiler and to follow 
the tutorial on the wiki.

Marco

Message-ID: <CALuHMPC0ztaACq6OWPccxfdiFcfe0JV_cRAG6PMV5u=uADge6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

we pleased to announce the Metatools plugin for QGIS [1]. Plugin provides
convenient interface for creating, editing and viewing metadata.

Key features are:
 - supports vector and raster data
 - displaying metadata in the HTML format
 - two editing modes: full metadata tree and filtered necessary fields
 - templates for organization, license, workflow and data type sections
 - update or create metadata in batch mode
 - automatic extraction of some metadata such as extent, number of
   bands and data type
 - embedding processing logs into metadata
 - preview generation

More detailed description available in article [2], currently only in
Russian (English version coming soon). Source code hosted in
GIS-Lab SVN repository [3]

Please give it a go and we'd like to have feedback.

Don't forget to turn on experimental plugins in your plugin installer.
Have fun.

Not sure.

Um, it should work as fcgi - not running it as fcgi leads to the problem that
you need to worry about where to put the DLLs.

Thanks.
I still have problems to extract layer parameters to metadata XML for shp though:
Operation can't be completed:
`/home/paolo/Desktop/Documenti/Didattica/home/comuni.shp|layerid=0' does not exist in
the file system,
and is not recognised as a supported dataset name.

All the best.

Replaced "grid" and "gridd" for "raster".
Of course, the question applies to "shapes", "vector"/"vector feature"
and probably other SAGA terms.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing an IPython plugin
Message-ID: <CAMEX5szk3+WD-0awYSkeFxRype8hiQFgWG81C_yWQ2GFLQsdGA@mail.gmail.com>

New (Experimental!) Plugin
====================

I just uploaded an alpha version of a plugin that allows an IPython kernel
to be integrated into QGIS. This in turn allows external IPython-powered
consoles to connect to QGIS and execute commands or inspect data. Version
0.2 of the plugin is now available from PyQGIS and is flagged
"Experimental":

    http://spatialserver.net/pyqgis_1.0/contributed/ipython_console.zip

I am making the announcement here, because I feel that the current state of
the plugin makes it most interesting to developers. I have tested the plugin
with QGIS 1.7.0 on OS X 10.6 and Ubuntu 11.4 and it appears to be usable.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcomed at GitHub:

  https://github.com/Sharpie/qgis-ipython


What is IPython?
=============

IPython is a __really__ nice shell for performing interactive work in the
Python programming language. Some killer features IPython provides compared
to the standard Python console are:

  - Tab completion for object and method names.
  - Function call tips that provide information about arguments on-the fly.
  - Easy access to docstrings.
  - "magic" commands that allow users to turn complex function calls into
simple, customized command lines.

Additionally, the v0.11 release completely re-factored the project and
brought about many exciting changes:

  - A distributed two-process system where computational kernels handle the
details of executing code and may be controlled by one or more console
processes that handle the details of sending user input and formatting
kernel output.
  - A new PyQt-based console with plenty of neat tricks such as
Pygments-based highlighting of source code and inline display of Matplotlib
graphs.
  - A high-level framework for performing parallel computing in an
interactive fashion.

For more information about IPython, see:

  The IPython website:
    http://www.ipython.org

  The manual section on interactive computing:
    http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/index.html

  A talk by Fernando Perez at SciPy 2011 which details many features of
v0.11:

http://www.archive.org/details/Wednesday-203-6-IpythonANewArchitectureForInteractiveAndParallel


How Does the Plugin Work?
=====================

The IPython plugin requires following dependencies to be installed:

  - Python 2.6 or 2.7
  - IPython v0.11 or v0.12-dev
  - PyZMQ
  - Pygments
  - Matplotlib

Unfortunately, Windows users are currently out of luck as QGIS appears to be
pinned to the version of Python provided by OSGEO4W which is currently at
2.5.x.

The plugin provides one new entry to the "Plugins" menu called "External
IPython Console". This launches an external process, based on
`ipython-qtconsole`, that communicates with an IPython kernel __running
inside of QGIS__. This means that every command entered through the console
is actually executed inside of QGIS.

The only downside I have noticed to running the console in a
process separated from QGIS is that the IPython console window cannot be
docked or otherwise integrated into the QGIS GUI.

__IMPORTANT NOTE__

One currently has to be careful when closing external Python consoles
because they can terminate the IPython kernel running inside of QGIS which
has the unfortunate side effect of causing QGIS to quit. The recommended way
to shut down an external console is to close the window and select "No, just
this Console" when asked if you would like to quit the Kernel. Choosing
"Yes, quit everything" or running the `exit()` command in the IPython shell
will cause QGIS to quit as well.

I am working on finding a way around this issue so that it will be more
difficult for users to accidentally terminate QGIS when all they wanted to
do was close the IPython console.


Future Directions
=============

There are plenty of things that need to be cleaned up in order to achieve a
smoother user interface such as better error messages and figuring out how
to handle situations where the kernel dies and needs to be restarted.

There are also many exciting possibilities that could be explored such as
using the parallel computing framework to build faster tools for GIS
analysis or using the IPython communication protocol make it easier for
other programs to communicate with QGIS.

If QGIS upgrades to version 2 of the SIP API, another exciting development
possibility is to replace the current Python console with an IPython console
that does not run in a separate process.

I have done some initial work on this front and managed to get a
proof-of-concept build that successfully ran the IPython console:

    https://github.com/Sharpie/Quantum-GIS/tree/ipython-console

The biggest challenge in upgrading to version 2 of the SIP API appears to
finding areas in the Python code where QString methods are used and
replacing them with equivalent Python string methods. The branch above is
very much an experiment---many things were simply commented out.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsExpression: replacement for QgsSearchString
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFfg8G-6wt5znWC5WPHdiTMvUz_XA2hUU+atCS0cy2pnEw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone

recently I have been trying to fix some flaws in search string
implementation and it turned out that rather than fixing them
one-by-one it will be easier to rewrite that code completely. Search
string and associated searching in attribute table was one of my first
contributions to QGIS and my first attempt to write a parser and an
evaluator. QgsExpression is my second attempt :-)

The main reason for the redesign was to bring the evaluation closer to
SQL semantics and to clean the code which started to be hard to
maintain.

QgsExpression is meant to be a replacement for QgsSearchString class.
Most of the changes are under the hood:
- fixed and simplifed the parser grammar and tree creation
- simplified lexer
- only one evaluation routine (instead of separate getValue/checkAgainst)
- correct handling of NULL values and three-value logic from SQL
(true, false, unknown)
- fixed error reporting
- easily extensible list of functions, saner evaluation of expressions
- using QVariant for return values instead of a special type
- slightly faster evaluation
- a more suitable class name
- tests included (!!!) :-)

Only few changes are visible for users:
- spaces were removed from "to int", "to real" and "to string"
functions because function names must not contain spaces
- null values are handled correctly by the functions and operators
- errors are reported when conversions between types fail

Btw. type conversions (currently supporting null, int, double, string)
are implemented in many different ways in databases. I have done some
tests on sqlite3, postgresql and mysql and many times there was no
consensus what the outcome of an evaluation should be:
- 7 > '6x' :: mysql=1, sqlite=0, postgresql=error
- 7 > '6' :: mysql=1, sqlite=0 (!), postgresql=1
- '6x' :: mysql=6 (+warning), sqlite=6, postgresql=error
- '3'+'5' :: mysql=8, sqlite=8, postgresql=error
- 3/5 :: mysql=0.6, sqlite=0, postgresql=0
- length(123) :: mysql=3, sqlite=3, postgresql=error
- 0 or 1 :: mysql=1, sqlite=1, postgresql=error
- 0 or 'x' :: mysql=0 (+warning), sqlite=0, postgresql=error

PostgreSQL is very strict about type conversions, Sqlite is not strict
at all and MySQL is somewhere in the middle. I have ended up with
these conversion rules:
- implicit conversions to desired types
- string->number conversions with invalid input return error
- arithmetic operators convert to numeric
- comparison with numeric type => numeric comparison


The code is here:
https://github.com/wonder-sk/Quantum-GIS/tree/expr

If there are no objections I will apply the changes to master in few
days. Given that I have been simultaneously writing unit tests I am
quite confident that there are not too many bugs (unit tests really
help!). In that branch I have replaced all the occurrences of search
string with expressions. So playing with search in attribute table or
doing calculation in field calculator will use the new engine.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] symbol levels in rule-based rendering

Message-ID: <1313786979.2933.34.camel@mk-desktop-smh>

Hi,
Thanks for raising this! After months of use of symbol levels in
rule-based rendering (SLinRBR), I found the implementation robust. I
have several colleagues using regularly my OSM styles. Yesterday I
deployed it on an intranet with the webclient, see:
http://www.qgis.org/qgiswiki/images/f/fd/Test_qgis_webclient_osm.png
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/QGIS_Server_Tutorial#Core_Features
So I support applying the SLinRBR patch into the master branch.

Still I agree the SLD logic is interesting as well and efforts in this
direction are welcome. I still believe it is  possible to somehow merge
the two: my understanding is that few changes in SLinRBR are needed to
make SLinRBR and SLD logic compatible (specifically: improvement of the
ElseFilter in current SLinRBR).
This is how we could simply define compatibility: a one-to-one
relationship between a set of SLinRBR rules and SLD rules.
A looser definition could be: given a set of SLinRBR rules, it is
possible to find a set of SLD rules that will give the same results for
every dataset (and vice versa).
An even looser definition would say "... give almost identical results
for almost all datasets". In fact, OGC recognizes that SLD rendering is
implementation specific (hence same SLD rules may give different
results):
"Whether all features are applied to each rule in sequence or whether
all suitable rules are applied to each feature in sequence is
implementation-specific, although there may be subtle differences in the
appearance of maps resulting from each of the approaches."
(source: OGC 05-077r4, "Symbology Encoding Implementation
Specification").

Again from the OGC specification: "Note that the above is a description
of the semantics of the ElseFilter and not a requirement that systems
implement exactly the procedural method described; any semantically
equivalent method will suffice." As the Spec. document recall, boolean
algebra and set theory show that there are many different ways to
express a given condition.

It is possible to have very similar results with the following tools on
complex OSM datasets:
- QGIS (with SLinRBR)
- Osmarender
- Mapnik
- Kosmos
There has been discussion in 2008 about using SLD as a way to share
rules between the last 3:
http://web.archiveorange.com/archive/v/wQWIbLKKl2Drk3qgOFep
I do not know the output today but this seems to confirm my feeling that
the different logics are somehow compatible.
If this is true, all the rest is related to the user interface and the
implementation.

Hope this helps!

All the best,
Mayeul

Hi,

Testing the Metatools, I notice the geographics box is always load with 
coords from actual SRS od map-canvas.
Instead in the ISO19115 it should always be filled with Geographicals 
coords (lat. long).
So it should convert the coords from SRS of MapCanvas to EPSG:4326.

Coordinates are transformed if layer has prj file. If there is no prj, then no
conversion.

I have 1.8 dev builds available now for OS X.  I am now using an installer package.  This is so I can include the same base and install the Python parts for the system it's installed on.  It also takes care of compiling the python scripts.

There are 2 installers, one with a full QGIS and one without the globe plugin (25 MiB with all the osg libraries).

The mapserver component is NOT included for now because it needs the fcgi library and Apache module, which Apple removed in Lion :(

Hi,
I'm testing the CSW plugin with GeoNetwork 2.7.0 trunk version.

Don't work
infact this sample return 0 result (should be return 1 result).

Instead it work if I remove the "ows:BoundingBox" value-tag.

      </ogc:Filter>
    </csw:Constraint>
  </csw:Query>

I'm not sure if this is a deprecated in the CSW std
or instead a bug of GN.
I submitted the problem to the guys of GN.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SAGA Interface for QGIS - Final GSoC Report
Message-ID: <CAA5P-m3-A9tTxprDnm1GyuDPgQ22V+CYs6kZv28=Bg1PPyKgDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am happy to say that this week saw many improvements in the QGIS
Processing Framework and the interface to SAGA.

Primarily, raster input and output works now, thanks to help from SAGA
developer Volker Wichmann. Single band local QGIS rasters are
transparently converted to SAGA format using GDAL, processed, and
imported back into QGIS. Many things could be improved and features
added, but the basic functionality is there.

To assess the progress of the interface, I have written a small
script, which checks module support, as determined by parameter
implementation. The programmatically collected stats, indicating
support for 170 modules (40%) are published in the Module Support[1]
wiki page, while the Tested Modules[2] page, maintained by Paolo,
contains a list of SAGA modules that have actually been tested.

Work on a settings dialog has started. It is still unclear how many
and which settings should be left to the user. Also on the GUI side,
an about dialog was implemented, which displays the new processing
icon by Robert Szczepanek.

In an effort to be consistent with the QGIS terminology, the string
"raster" is now automatically substituted for instances of "grid" in
each SAGA module's text: Names, tags, parameters and descriptions.

Less visible to the user, but still important, the SAGA code has been
refactored a little. Work is still pending on this issue.
Additionally, the plugin's objects are now managed in a cleaner way.

Validator and default value bugs have been fixed. Further testing is necessary.

Finally, due to rising interest in interfacing other libraries (GRASS,
OTB) I have published the API documentation[3] on the framework and
started writing a Developer's Tutorial[4].

Google Summer of Code 2011 is almost over, but it is my intention to
continue maintaining this software, first focusing on polishing the
available code and later adding more features: Support for further
parameter types, interactive modules, and module instance
serialization, among many other proposed.


Best regards & thanks a lot for the help,


Camilo

Hi Marco

You can test that by disabling line 90 of qgsmapcanvas.cpp

viewport()->setAttribute( Qt::WA_PaintOnScreen, true );

Marco

Perhaps try removing these libtool helper files (*.la). You don't need
them anyway.

Please note: due to time constraints, I'm able to properly test only a small subset
of commands. Your help in testing more of them will be much appreciated.
All the best.

Looking good Martin.  No objections from me.  The old QgsSearchString was a
bit string in the way it handled a few things so I'm glad it's been
simplified in your chances.

I'm just merging with my expression labeling branch, which used
QgsSearchString at the moment. I will report if I find any bugs.

I don't mean nobody ever run it under Windows :) I only mean all users I know 
(including myself) was never able to do it, and also past discussions here 
weren't optimistic. Now, when JEF said it finally works as fcgi, I'll try to 
debug it once again.

Hi

As previously discussed at hackfest, some (c++) plugins should be
moved to qgis application - they may better integrate and additionally
fewer modules loaded on startup will positively affect startup time. I
have just pushed commits moving copyright label, north arrow and scale
bar plugins to qgis application code, they are renamed to
QgsDecoration* classes. Now they are accessible from View >
Decorations menu. In future it would be nice to convert them to map
canvas items so that they would keep their position on canvas instead
of moving with map when panning.

All of the decorations used to be enabled by default (when loaded). I
wonder if turning them off by default would be more convenient -
probably not everyone would like to see mainly copyright label and
north arrow. Comments?

+1 for turning them off by default, they are usually added the last and

Hi

Thanks Martin! Yeah turning them into map canvas items would be nice.
Did we already break API compatibility? It would be nice to tag git at
the point before it is/was broken.

By the way I don't know when you last disabled python, but QGIS starts
up really quickly without it - I think scanning python plugins adds a
lot more overhead than scanning C++ ones...or maybe its loading up the
python bindings in general that kill start up time.

Regards

Tim

No, these changes have not break anything. The only possible problem
might I see is that users which compile qgis from source will have to
disable (or better remove) the affected plugin modules, otherwise they
may get the decorations twice (both from plugin and from app).

I know, there is quite a difference.

One thing that makes the loading slow is that the plugin installer
walks through all the plugins (even those which are disabled) and
calls their classFactory() method to find out whether a plugin is
broken (due some import / syntax errors).
@Borys: is it possible to get rid of this check during startup?

To optimize the loading speed I would like to move plugins' metadata
from __init__.py to a text file (e.g. metadata.txt) - this would mean
that the plugin code would not have to be loaded at all if disabled.
Moreover reading of metadata would be simpler for plugin repository.

Finally, there may be also some plugins that do too much
(unnecessary?) initialization during startup which could be postponed.

Message-ID: <4E521891.9080705@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
One of the great thing we plan to develop for the new Processing framework it to make
easy for user to pipe one command into another, so to build complex workflows of
analysis.
One idea: add a + button on the single module window to add further modules in a
chain, taking the output of the first command and giving it as an input to the next
one; moreover we could have a Save button to store the command sequence in a file.
Of course one could think of more complex extensions, adding support for cycles,
recursivity etc., but this seems a simple approach to start with.
Comments or ideas?
All the best.

Hi all,

I've updated the wiki page [1] with the last weekly report.

Now DB Manager [2] plugins allows to use the import feature by drag'n'drop a
table
from a database to another one.

I've uploaded the new version of DB Manager that handle with that feature,
it's
available on the Faunalia repo, but you need to compile and install the
import_layer branch [3] from my GH repo for making the manager working with
the new feature.

Comments are very welcome!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] new plugin scenario
Message-ID: <4E52A750.70002@duif.net>

Hi devs,

For a pet-project I wrote a small plugin. I thought of calling it
'xytools plugin' (it should make it easier to handle those csv/excell
files with data and (empty) x,y columns).

I want it to be a 'proper' qgis plugin, so please correct me if I'm wrong:

- I upload my code to github
(what's the idea there: to put it in github in my own space:
https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/ so others can fork/use it?)

- I 'registre' the project to hub.qgis.org (thereby making it possible
for others to issue bugs).
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins

- I upload the plugin to the plugin repositories:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ (for qgis >-= 2.0)
http://pyqgis.org/ (for qgis <2.0)

Do I miss something here?
Like: is there a central page do write some information about the plugin
(I normally did that on my own server, but are happy to do that
somewhere else (rst preferably).

Is there already a wikipage for this scenario? If not I will write this
down in a page.

Ok, thanks for input.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps the plugin put's a button in the digitize menu, with which you can
(after loading a dbf/csv file) set an x and y column and then fill the
x,y for every record by clicking in a (reference) map.
You can also write a (point) shapefile of that table, or a csv. So by
loading it in the delimited text plugin you can save it to whatever you
want.
It is written for somebody who wanted to digitize old fieldnames
(veldnamen we say in dutch) from old historical maps. He typed all data
in an excell file but had no x,y values, only geotiffs of the original
maps. This plugin made it possible to fill the xy colums by clicking in
the geotiff...

It's great to see the final touches improving the usability.

Regarding the number of settings it would be good to offer as few
choices as possible. Many times the settings can be avoided and a
sensible default choice can be used. For example the setting "Number
of tags to show" is very confusing.

For the module dialog the status bar could be changed to a simple
QLabel if you are not going to add further widgets or indicators to
it. The status bar also contains a superfluous size gripper for
changing dialog size. Additionally the Open and Save buttons simply
close the module dialog - that's a bit unexpected :)

Thanks for the documentation. In the developer's tutorial I am missing
two important bits:
1. how to implement the module's functionality when "Execute" button is clicked
2. how to execute a module from a script or python console

It was great to have you aboard during the summer! We hope you enjoyed
it and you will continue hacking on the processing/SAGA tools to
support even broader range of modules and to make the user experience
as seamless as possible. And of course you are welcome to start
hacking on other parts of QGIS, too :-)

Agreed, in general terms. What the right number of settings is, we'll
find out through experimentation. As you probably noticed, the 'number
of tags' slider doesn't actually do anything, yet.

I use the size gripper! Sometimes the parameters don't fit
horizontally, so I expand the dialog. Anyways, the feedback mechanism
should be refined. I like those "non intrusive" pop-ups that e.g.
firefox features, don't know if they are available in Qt, though.

Yes. The tutorial is in a very early stage. Next chapter will be about
that. I am looking for some simple algorithm or library to have the
demo module do something at least remotely realistic/useful.

> 2. how to execute a module from a script or python console

That would belong in the user's docs, I think. I have recently added
some convenience functions. Will probably modify them, but for now you
can e.g. type:

from processing import framework
framework["Pythagoras' Tree"].execute(Method = 2)

See also issues #46 & #47 (github issue tracker).

Thanks! It has been a great opportunity and lots of fun. I certainly
will continue hacking on the processing & SAGA code.
In the long term, there are also some experiments I'd like to do with
some geophysical models, to return a bit to the semantics of the
problem.

Can you test 0.1.13 version? We add some changes that probably
should fix this issue.

I am not sure if it makes sense to spend time on a solution like this
because the number of use cases is quite limited. Surely one could
create simple linear chains of modules, but creating anything more
complex would be quite inconvenient (e.g. a process where module C
uses output of modules A and B). I believe that a graphical model
builder (where a box = module, an arrow = data transfer) is the only
long term solution, something like this:

Hi!

I agree with martin - such a Modeler could be a great improvement but
I assumed it would be somethink like the WxGUI_Modeler ..
(Also ESRI has something like that)
Putting things(modules) together like a diagram would be much easier
for the user than remembering a chain ..
Did not Tim start something like that with Openmodeler?
(http://openmodeller.sourceforge.net/)
Do you think we could use that?

There is PyQt Visual Modeller for R package (i.e. Red R) which is sort
of derivative of Orange.

Red R
http://www.red-r.org/

Orange
http://orange.biolab.si/features.html

This is similar to ArcGIS Model Builder.

The beauty of Red-R and Orange is uses python and Qt (i.e. PyQt), so I
can be easily adapted for QGIS instead of using WxPython which Grass
use.

 Personally I use FME (Safe Software, commercial) which has a graphical 
 workbench. I think it is quite powerfuly and easy to use (not for 
 everything, but a lot).

 Geokettle is something similar to FME (based on Java and not as 
 powerful as FME, but getting closer).

 It would be nice to have something similar that integrates nicely with 
 QGIS.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Different behavior getting crs from SL and PG
	provider
Message-ID: <CAA6k8-J19Qbeb7_yoF3DUQZf1BbnqDJhDD+Z52__AKtxdbLb1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,
working on the import layer feature I noticed that there's a difference
when getting the layer CRS using the PG and SL provider's crs() method.

While the PG crs() calls the QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::createFromSrid,
the SL crs method instead uses the
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::createFromPrj4.

This is an inconsistent behavior.

When I load a table with geometry and srid 3003,
if the source is a PG database I get a layer with the QGis 3003 definition
that contains towgs84 params, otherwise from SL I get a layer with a
custom CRS, similar to the QGis one but without the towgs84 params.

This creates some problems trying to import the SL layer into a PG database
because QGis is unable to get the postgisSrid from the SL layer with the
custom CRS, even if it should be 3003.

I think both should work in the same manner, but I don't know if it's more
correct to get crs from srid (in this case both the layers will use the QGis

crs definition) or from the proj4string.

Any idea?

Message-ID: <CALCNqkadf+G55HJgnxH3eqhmv2BxJWmsO1K9a0-ioxeajV5Mfg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I would like to put out a maintenance release of the 1.7 branch at the
end of this month. There won't be too much activity surrounding the
release as the branch is in feature freeze. There may have been some
small string changes so it would be good if the translators could give
the branch a quick once over.

I am behind a couple of weeks on checking the application of
backportable code, but I will be going over the last few weeks of
commits and backporting anything relevant to the release branch.
If you have applied bug fixes to master, it would be great if you
could help me to make sure they have also been applied to the release
branch.

Regards

Yes, I also imagine something similar.
But, I prefer more ordered layouts, where you have all outputs in a
column on the left side, and all inputs in a column on the right side.
In between all connections displayed as lines of different color
depending on parameter type and such.

A bit like qjackctl's patchbay:
http://ubuntu.allmyapps.com/data/q/j/qjackctl-jack-control/UBUNTU-9.04/qjackctlPatchbayForm1.png

It looks tidier and would also be a bit easier to implement than
free-floating boxes.

On the logic side:
For input and output the most flexible would be to use python scripts.
Of course, it is harder than e.g. XML, and there would be limits to
what python code it would understand on input. But still, I think it
is the best option.

The user would then have the option of saving these "workflow presets"
and using them like any regular module.

Sextante has a nice modeler tool - it may be a good example how it could work:
http://www.gvsig.com/files/images/screenshots/gvSIG_Sextante_02.png

AFAIK it also handles saga (although most modules were reimplemented
in java) and even grass modules.

In fact Sextante is already a processing toolbox - it is written in
java  so I'm not sure if it could be integrated in qgis, but if a new
framework is built in c++/python, it is nevertheless very interesting
to see which design decision they took.

 I wonder if we could establish a mailinglist for QGIS web-client 
 developers? I will be working more actively on the webclient and would 
 like to use it for discussion and announcements, as well as contact with 
 the translators. Most new features require new translations.

 Should I use the qgis-developer mailinglist or would we setup a 
 separate mailing-list?

 Andreas

It would be nice to release 1.7.1 version with only bugfixes and no new
features.

I discovered that with QGIS 1.6-1.7 WMS connection never uses proxy
user/password authentication, this is a big problem in corporate
environments. I filed the bug #3844. The bug appeared after the rewrite of
QGIS connection management (see this: #3912 it was fixed, but now it is
broken again).

We discovered that also the plugin repository never uses proxy 
user/password.
Perhaps will use the same classes ?
It work only with proxy anonymous (without user/pwd).
So to update the plugins we need to put the repositories in the white-list
(very very bad practice for network administrators).

 Hi Andrea,

 strange - I work behind a proxy at our local government and never had a 
 proxy problem for the past 1.5 years or so. Definitely QGIS 1.6, 1.7 and 
 current trunk are fine regarding the proxy.

 Note that you have to specify the proxy in the QGIS global options --> 
 Network tab, usually as HttpProxy. QGIS doesn't read the system proxy.

 Could you more specifically explain what proxy problems you have? Or 
 maybe there is a specific problem of your own proxy implementation? Is 
 it more pedantic than other proxies?

 Andreas

QGis uses a QT class (QNetworkAccessManager) to handle the user
authentication,
so I would exclude this is a QGis bug.

Indeed if it were a QGis bug, e.g. an error in setting proxy host and port,
then connection shouldn't have to work also without authentication.

Both these problems may be related to a QT bug in NTLM(v2) authentication,
see at [1].

@Luca: running the python plugin installer under the proxy, does it work?

Some notes on my own experience on using qgis through an isa proxy with ntlm authentication:

1-had to use cntlm to overcome ntlm authentication until recently (1.8 nightly)
2-have some erratic behavior, but the best configuration that works every time is setting the proxy type to httpproxy (not defaultproxy), then hostname without http:// or any domain, the username without domain prefix. That's it.

I'd just like to add that this is a must to have qgis in a company. Without it working I wouldn't be even considering introducing qgis company wide, which I am planning now on doing ;)

Python plugin installer uses QHttp and it works behind proxy. There's an
interesting comment in its code:

source: installer_data.py

# --- class QPHttp
----------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# --- It's a temporary workaround for broken proxy handling in Qt

Theoretically you don't need to create a project on github - when
registered on hub.qgis you should be able to get git repository
directly there. However obviously something is wrong with the server
settings, since the read-only URLs for repositories listed for various
plugins are not working, e.g.
$ git clone http://qgis.org/git/file-browser.git
Cloning into file-browser...
fatal: http://qgis.org/git/file-browser.git/info/refs not found: did
you run git update-server-info on the server?

Similarly the developer URL requires a password for 'gitosis' user and
it is not clear what password to enter.

@Pirmin / Alex - any  idea what's going on?


> - I upload the plugin to the plugin repositories:
> http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ (for qgis >-= 2.0)

plugins.qgis.org repository is nowadays mainly in testing mode, unless
you would like to help with testing it is sufficient to upload the
plugin to pyqgis.org. I foresee we will do some backwards incompatible
changes regarding the plugins (e.g. metadata in a text file, PyQt api
2), then we may announce that repository is ready for 2.0 only
plugins.

On the hub.qgis when registered a project you get also a wiki,
documents, news and files section - probably everything you would need
for a plugin.

I am not aware of that.

Hi,

 

I have been trying to get GDAL merge to work, but to no avail. (Win7  x86 /
QGIS 1.6.0)

 

The GDAL bin directory is set to D:\Program Files\Quantum GIS
Copiapo\apps\gdal-17\bin

 

The message I receive is "'python' is not recognized as an internal or
external command, 
operable program or batch file."

 

I have installed Python, set the system PATH etc, but this has not helped. I
even installed OSGeo4W separately, but it says:

 

'import site' failed; use -v for traceback

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "D:\OSGeo4W\bin\gdal_merge.py", line 31, in <module>

    import gdal

ImportError: No module named gdal

 

Please help!

 

Thanks,

 

Rob

Hi,

you don't need to install python separately, both the standalone and
the osgeo4w installers bring their own copies.

why "partially shp"? and what about rasters? wms? wfs?

In the devices you used the live tracking tool was working with the
integrated gps receiver?

Hi Marco,

sorry I have a very slow connection actually and I didn't checked the

Will you work anytime soon on the GPS/live tracking support?

the number of contributed python plugins is increasing quickly and it is
very confusing for both the users and the testers how/where report the
issues/suggestions/requests.

We have a proper platform at hub.qgis.org but most of the plugins
developers missed to create the plugins projects.

If you agree I will (starting from next week) create the proper projects
on hub.qgis.org (in the "user plugins" section) and set the plugin
author as project manager (so among the other things he can start
receive the tickets notifications).

I would suggest to every plugin developer to register in hub.qgis.org
and when the projects are ready to eventually migrate the tickets
already open on other platforms, like google code.

Ideally the redmine projects should be automatically created each time a
developer uploads a new plugin to the contributed repository (or any
other repository available by default in QGIS).

This way we will finally have a common place where the users can go (or
be redirected) when a plugin issue surfaces. This can be stated then in
the documentation, the site, etc.

Cheers

Hi,
Myself I would register right away to such a list! However I believe it
might be good to have a common list for  QGIS Web server and QGIS
webclient.
(+) QGIS Web server implements non-standard wms capabilities (like the
print functionality) and QGIS webclient makes use of them
(-) You will loose some readers. There are already many qgis mailing
list. If one discussion starts about the desktop print composer and then
trolls to the server (or start with server and goes to desktop), then
part of the discussion will be on the wrong list.

My 2 cents.
Mayeul
PS: thanks for the web client!

Message-ID: <CAG4NReK9Srufqq+OqUpGe50y8Sw2NhcXcruYeg72K3Vsy1TO-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

Value Tool does not work for rasters displayed through Reproj. On the Fly.
Any plans to include this feature? Displaying is good, but actually accessing to
the values is equally important.
Also, considering this is the only tool in QGIS for the interactive
check of raster values,
should not this plugin be considered part of the core?

this is known issue, but is a contributed plugin and the author does
not seems to have time/interest in updating it.



> should not this plugin be considered part of the core?


I agree, this tool should be core as it is fundamental for any raster analysis.

Hi Giovanni, list,

is it possible for the plugin author to create the plugin section as a
subproject of Users Plugins? As now, when I log in I can only add it as
a new project.

thanks for clarification!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GDAL Raster Merge
Message-ID: <00b201cc63ee$0d45b460$27d11d20$@co.uk>

I have used the QGIS 1.7.0 / GDAL 1.7.3 raster merge tool to join a number
of Os OpenData GeoTiff maps.

 

There are two issues with this:

 

1.       The file size of the merged GeoTiff is over 10x the size of the
combined originals;

2.       The merged map is in greyscale only, and needs to be in colour.

 

Does anyone know if I am doing something obviously wrong here?

 

Thanks :)

Try to enable compression adding creation options to your command.
More info you can find in GeoTiff format page [0]

> 2.?????? The merged map is in greyscale only, and needs to be in colour.
By default GDAL merge all input rasters into single band image. May be you
problem can be solved by adding "-separate" parameter.

You mean helping the email clients to automatically filter or classify
emails? If this is easy both for email writers and readers, that would
be great!

Done. The check is now performed only when installing a new plugin:

https://github.com/borysiasty/Quantum-GIS

In my computer (186 python plugins installed) disabling this check decreases 
the loading time from ~12 to ~9 sec with all plugins (except the installer) 
disabled, and doesn't make any visible difference when they all are enabled 
(~21 sec). I counted from start to the splashscreen disapear; not included the 
first run after any modification.

Well, I haven't noticed any difference in this. Also completely disabling the 
installer gives loading speed ~ 8-9 sec (the <1 sec speed-up can be within the 
measurement error).

without any doubts

Partially fixed in my repo: http://github.com/borysiasty/Quantum-GIS/

It's due to Qt bug when sorting a tree widget. Now it doesn't occur when the 
installer starts, but still does when you try to sort the list (strictly 
speaking: the tree)

Given that Marco so easily ported QGIS to Android (though it still
doesnt run on my circa 1980's scientific calculator so black mark to
you there Marco), I think he meant 'I will rewrite the internet email
protocol so that if  understands QGIS messages and auto routes
messages to interested users....


But seriously, ...tagging subjects like [WEBCLIENT] Help my blah blah
blah... is what he had in mind I think....though that requires a level
of inolvement in list politics that most of our subscribers may not
possess I am afraid....

That is strange, I didn't changed anything in my client (gmail from web)...
Now it should be set as plain-text only (I hope), even if it used to send coded
in a message both plain-text and html so the receiver client could display the
preferred one.

If I remember the problem Andrea wrote, neither the plugin installer worked
under proxy in that case.
Probably it was due a unsupported authentication method because proxy settings
was well-filled.

@Andrea, could you investigate further and give us more details about
that proxy
configuration, e.g. auth methods supported?
I think we may find a solution sooner if people share our own
experience in proxies,
like Duarte did yet.

Thanks a lot.

Hi Giuseppe,

We have some situations of some Local Governments that was absolutely 
unable to access to the plugins lists.
Menawhile others was able to.
After some try, we discovered that all the Local Government that was 
unable to access the local plugin was with a proxy with user/password.
Unfortunately we don't have a proxy with user/pwd so we don't able to 
replicate.

However thx to this Local Governments we can do some tests.
We try with HttpProxy and with HttpProxyCaching , but no success.

We discover also that the same problem was on Layer-WMS that use the 
same proxy settings. Also it don't work if the proxy use the couple 
user/pwd.

To make the quest more complex was the fact that if the destination was 
inserted in a whitelist (of the proxy) then the proxy don't ask for the 
couple user/pwd and go directly to destination.

These make all more complex because meanwhile the repository of the 
plugin are of course not in whitelist. Often the destinations of 
LayerWMS was in whitelist (ie: another Local Government that has a Wms 
Server and so on).

Infact when the proxy see that the destination is in a whitelist don't 
ask the user/pwd but go to it directly.

----
BUT PAY ATTENTION:
if a destination is in a proxy whitelist don't mean "is possible to go 
to it without setting the proxy".
The proxy need to be set however. Only the proxy to go directly without 
ask for user/pwd.
----

I don't know if the couple user/pwd that this proxies will ask for is 
really the couple user/pwd in the proxy settings page.
- perhaps they are two thing completely different-
Infact I don't understand why if the destination is in a whitelist the 
proxy should don't ask for usr/pwd.

Instead I think the couple usr/pwd of these proxies is a sort of 
super-protection.
Something like this
- "if the destination is unknown then I (the proxy) want to know who are 
you before allow you to go to the destination".

Unfortunately is quite hard for me to do other tests using the Local 
Governments proxies.

I prefer to install a my own proxy and use it for some tests.
http://www.ausgamers.com/features/read/2638752
Let me know. If is need I try do it.

Regards,
Andrea.

Hi
Yes, tagging the subjects is the easiest to implement, use, and is
forgiving.. It would already be great. Disadvantage is that it makes
long subjects sometimes, not always though.
For instance, this subject would become:

[Qgis-developer][WEBCLIENT] Sepecific mailinglist?

It is possible to make shorter subjects by modifying the first part of
the subject (server side):
[Qgis-dev][WEBCLIENT] Specific mailinglist?

Or even [QgisDev][WebClient] Specific mailinglist?

We already have [Qgis-tr], so why not have shorter tags than
[Qgis-developer] ?

I suggest CamelCase for readibility, the email client filters are
normally case insensitive.

For the tags, we need to agree on them to help users create rules. This
should be somehow consistent with tagging practices in tracking, wiki,
etc.
Badly-tagged emails can still be filtered manually by end readers.

My genuine question implied something different, one possibility would
have been to put tags in the full text for the cases where there is
overlap between two subjects. This would avoid very long subjects, but
those situations are rare and this would slow down the email filters a
lot, so forget it.

No I didn't. Now after adding my public key and trying e.g.
$ git clone gitosis@qgis.org:metaedit.git
I get correctly asked for my passphrase for the private key. But then
the cloning fails:

ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

Probably only people marked as project developers are able to read the
repository?

For the record, the read-only URL fails with this error message:

$ git clone http://qgis.org/git/metaedit.git
Cloning into metaedit...
fatal: http://qgis.org/git/metaedit.git/info/refs not found: did you
run git update-server-info on the server?

Well, but that's a loading time from "hot" start, right? You should
first drop operating system's file cache to experience a "cold" start
that has to load all files from hard drive (and not just from memory).
How to do it:

But the plugins still have to be loaded (at least their __init__.py)
to get the metadata. I expect the loading time to drop significantly -
just try to run qgis with --noplugins option to see the difference.

Hi, the problem with the read only url exists since longer, I had a 
similar problem back in march publishing my masters thesis plugins.
Pirmin said something about a needed server update, but I can't recall 
what was it and couldent find it in the archives.

sorry

No objections from me, the new class seems to work well.

Are you going to remove the search string classes when merging or do you plain 
to wait until  the first other api break has happened?

Hi Marco,

There are plenty of spatialite databases in Sandro site.

You can get one here.

I will keep the search string classes for now, but surely remove them
before 2.0.

Hi

I would also vote for using qgis-users mailing list for user land

Apparently my email is too late as this is already merged.
Still, IMHO, I would suggest that your rule be as close as possible to
the existing rules of one major RDBMS (am I correct in assuming that
your implementation is close to MySQL?), or you even better you may use
the rule of one existing DB wrapper.
You will probably get more consistent/robust results by trying to follow
as much as possible an existing standard instead of inventing Yet
Another Conversion Standard.
There will be use cases that you have not thought about yet. In front of
them, the Qgis community would ask "how standard x solves this problem?"
instead of "should we use standard x, y or z for this particular case?"

I am a big fan of postgres. But if you follow (say) MySQL 70 % of the
time, postgres 20 % of the time and your own rules the remaining 10%, I
would prefer if you try to use 100% MySQL-like rules.
My 2 cents.

Hi Mayeul

the implicit conversion rules are generally the same as MySQL, with
the exception that string that cannot be converted to a number
triggers an error while in MySQL it "just" produces a warning. We are
talking here about corner cases of implicit conversions where the SQL
standard either does not define the behavior or the common RDBMS
ignore that.

I like this idea but we need to bear in mind that changing the server
side added header from mailman might mess up existing filters for QGIS
Dev. If nobody objects though we can file a ticket on the OSGEO SAC
for this to be done.

I believe for read-only access that does not require you to be a member
of the project we need to enable a gitweb service on the server or
something similar via apache - gitosis from what I know is for handling
authenticated actions on git repos over ssh.

I can explore this more is September.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi

I'm getting  a lot of win build errors relating to qgsexpression:


http://pastie.org/2444030


It could just be some stale binaries left behind that msvc is hanging
on to - still investigating...

Congrats with the project.
Neither download link is working for me. Eventually I downloaded from here

https://github.com/mbernasocchi/qgis-android/tree/master/apk/bin

Installed and working on Motorola Defy with Cyanogenmod 7 installed. 
When opening shapefile, gives error about cannot open database and when 
touch "ok" open it anyway. Have not tried rastar files yet. Small screen 
is limitation currently (it has been noted that Qgis is currently not 
optimized for such small screens) also cannot zoom in or out using 
fingertips ;-) .

Thanks again
evert

I tried that link as well but I can't get the apk to download. Right
clicking and saving the link downloads it as a .htm file.

I took it down from that link, it is much easier for me to keep the apk in
the repo. I added an install file explaining howto install. Eventually I
downloaded from here

Hi all

Seems it depends also on the bison version.
I'm getting some errors with bison 2.3. With bison 2.4.1, it works nicely.

 cd /opt/qgisms/src/Quantum-GIS/build/src/core && /usr/bin/bison -
o/opt/qgisms/src/Quantum-GIS/build/src/core/qgsexpressionparser.cpp -d -v -t 
/opt/qgisms/src/Quantum-GIS/src/core/qgsexpressionparser.yy
/opt/qgisms/src/Quantum-GIS/src/core/qgsexpressionparser.yy:54.14-19: syntax 
error, unexpected string, expecting =

(bison 2.3 understands only deprecated syntax %name-prefix = "exp_" )

cd /opt/qgisms/src/Quantum-GIS/build/src/core && /usr/bin/bison -
o/opt/qgisms/src/Quantum-GIS/build/src/core/qgsexpressionparser.cpp -d -v -t 
/opt/qgisms/src/Quantum-GIS/src/core/qgsexpressionparser.yy                                                                 
/opt/qgisms/src/Quantum-GIS/src/core/qgsexpressionparser.yy:120.28-33: syntax 
error, unexpected type, expecting string or identifier

Seems 2.3 does not support the <> notation. Not sure what to do here...

Regards,
Marco

The important part is just at the top of the error log:
1>C:/dev/cpp/Quantum-GIS/src/core/qgsexpressionlexer.ll(30) : fatal
error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'qgsexpressionparser.hpp': No
such file or directory

This results in qgis_core not being rebuilt and thus throwing all the
other errors. I don't know why the qgsexpressionparser.hpp was not
generated by bison - maybe try to start a clean build of qgis_core and
watch if there are any bison-related errors.

Looking at the version history of bison, the 2.4.x releases started in
2008 while the 2.3 release went out back in 2006. Maybe we could drop
support for 2.3 ? Apparently even debian stable ships with 2.4.x.

FYI I am using 2.4:

C:\dev\cpp>bison --version
bison (GNU Bison) 2.4.1

I tried looking for bison errors but didn't see any (after doing a clean build).

Debian stable isn't the most conservative distro any more. It's the enterprise 
distributions. E.g. I have the mentioned problem on a CentOS 5.6 machine (for 
the foss4g WMS benchmark), and 5.6 seems to have appeared 8. April 2011.

Personally I have no problem with 2.4 as minimum (e.g. generating the parser 
file with my ubuntu locally and copying to the server). I'm however not sure if 
we might frustrate some admins trying to compile qgis on their enterprise 
distros.

Regards,
Marco

Hi

Ok it seems to been caused by me inadvertantly trying to build as
Debug instead of RelWithDebInfo (well thats my best guess as to what
caused it because the problem is gone now).


Thanks

Tim

Message-ID: <1314643629.3212.20.camel@erasmus.antoniusz.homelinux.org>

Hi all,

Today, when i tried to do some coordinate calculations on a shapefile
with Field Calculator, the program crashed.

the steps:

1. start qgis (new project - OTF: on/off)
2. add an point type shapefile (same projection whit the project)
3. Open attribute table
4. Start editing
(4a. Make a selection)
5. Open field calculator
6. select update exiting fields
7. select the column from the table (field type: real)
8. enter: $x
9. segfault

-------------

the system: debian sid

the debug output:

Hi

thanks for reporting - fixed in commit e32acf53. Please note that it
is much better to report bugs on the issue tracking site, otherwise
the report may be left unnoticed. Here is the site where to report
bugs:

Umm... I wonder what policy we should use here. Apparently there will
always be users with old systems and old libraries, not wanting to
upgrade just because of QGIS. On the other hand I think we are still
quite conservative about the versions of software we depend on since
we do not require very recent releases.

We might want to pick a rule of thumb saying when to safely drop
support for old versions of software and what is the earliest time to
depend on a recent release. I would say that e.g. 3 years are enough
to drop support for old sw and not to depend on releases younger than
one year. For example we have used Qt4.4 as a requirement for several
QGIS releases - that version dates back to 2008 and thus we may
probably push the minimal required version to 4.5 or 4.6 in order to
use newer APIs.

Message-ID: <4E5C7BE1.6020606@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
In redmine, it is possible to have a ticket that is classified as Resolution:Invalid
(or fixed, etc.), and Status:New (instead of Closed). This is meaningless to me, and
causes confusion (we have many tickets that appear open, and are in fact closed. I
think the field resolution is useless, as the same info could be put on Status.
Also, the default view lists open tickets, which include Resolved items, which seems
inappropriate.
Am I wrong?
All the best.

Apparently, Volkan Kepoglu's Repository is down since several days. BTW, I would

I am a new QGIS learner, when I compile the source of QGIS, why can't make
it success.
I just compile the sourse obey the qgis-1.6.0 code compilation guide written
by Tim and others.
When I just compile the qgis_core Item , it apprears the error follows :

 1  1 (C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe)  pluginstaller
 2  1 (C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe)  osmplugin
 3 error PRJ0019: : "..." compile_python_files

 6  1 (C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe)  ftools_tools

Is there anyone can help me?

Hi all.
Just tested the new geeralizer plugin, thanks a lot. Much faster than I expected.
I hope it will be expanded to handle also to polygons. I noticed however that
Chaiken's results do not change when changing parameters.
Hope this helps.
All the best.

Hi All,

In a custom PyQgis app I am developing, I open a project file, the layers
get loaded.  I add another layer to the project.  The map layer registry
count of layers increases by one, but the QgsProject.isDirty() method still
returns False.  Am I missing something here??

Thanks,

Sounds good to me. 
In any case, it would be good to give a descriptive error message to the user 
(e.g. 'your bison is too old, use version >=2.4').

OK, the check has been updated to require bison 2.4 for master.

It is not just the repository - the whole domain for their Geodetic and
Geographic Information Technologies department is down :)
I wonder if it has been shut down...
Does anyone know if the only plugins there were SDA4PP and indentify?

Message-ID: <CAKKhk7yjT7=q_yFNuf31mDrv3rBB5WWwuk3o_yzxB3QT2jipfg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,

I have compiled and build the Qgis 1.7 using Visual C++ environment and it
working fine in my local machine. But,

after creating the installer and installed in the fresh machine(No
environment variable set in the fresh machine),

while start up Qgis 1.7 crashes. Then I removed the qgispython.dll in the
bin folder, Qgis 1.7 working without any

issues. I know that Qgis work without python. But I need to enable the
python plugin.

I have referred the http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1214 link and followed
the changes but no uses. Can anyone

help me to solve this issue.

Please note that the installer is working in my local machine, I guess due
to Environment variable(PYTHONHOME) set

in my machine it is working.

FYI:
Environment - Visual C++ (OS - VISTA)
QGIS version - 1.7.0
Python version - 2.5.2


Regards,
Sasikumar

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Composer Window loses SIGNAL/SLOT connection?
Message-ID: <587471121.51451314783479841.JavaMail.root@srsofaioi13477.ktso.ch>

Hi   
  
My aim is to add an additional toolBar with one button the all ComposerWindows I open. I created the following code to achieve that.  
  
  def __init__(self, iface):  
    self.composerWindow = {}  
    self.myPrintAction = {}  
    myApp = self.iface.mainWindow()    
    QObject.connect(myApp, SIGNAL("composerAdded(QgsComposerView*)"), self.initPrintEnvironment)  
  
  def initPrintEnvironment(self,  myComposerView):  
      self.printMenue = PrintMenue(self.iface,  myComposerView)  
      self.composerWindow[myComposerView] = myComposerView.composerWindow()  
      myToolBar = QToolBar()  
      self.myPrintAction[myComposerView] = QAction(QIcon(), "SO!GIS Print",  self.composerWindow[myComposerView])  
      myToolBar.addAction(self.myPrintAction[myComposerView])  
      self.composerWindow[myComposerView].addToolBar(myToolBar)  
      QObject.connect(self.myPrintAction[myComposerView], SIGNAL("triggered()"), self.printMenue.run)         
  
  
The code logic works fine when I open the first composer window. A new toolbaar with one button and the text SO!GIS Print is created. Click on this button starts the expected printMenue. The composer 1 window is still open. Now I open a second composer window. Everything works fine in this window. But now when I switch back to composer1 window. A click on the does nothing. I can open composer windows as much as I like. Only the last created composer window has a functioning button.  
  
Im not shure weather it is as problem of my code or the problem is hidden deeper in the QGIS code.  
  
Ill apprecciate an help or hint.

Message-ID: <007701cc67c1$d3a867c0$7af93740$@co.uk>

Hi,

 

Has anyone seen a plug-in to create a new vector layer directly in a PostGIS
table, rather than saving it to file then uploading it?

 

If not, could this be considered for future development of QGIS?

 

Cheers,

 

Rob

Giovanni,

Thanks, but this only seems to be able to load in shapefiles.

What I would like is to remove the need to store a shapefile in the first
instance.

Eg. Press the 'New Shapefile Layer' toolbar button, fill in the attributes,
then select a PostGIS DB to store to, not a shapefile.

Cheers

OK sometimes it is good to describe a problem and oft it will happen to 
find out the solution by yourself. The solution is:

self.printMenue[myComposerView] = PrintMenue(self.iface, myComposerView)

self.printMenue has to be a dictionary as well. Now it works.

No need to make a shapefile.

Start postgis manager, make a connection to your database en use button
'create table'. There you have the same dialog as you have with making a
new shapefile: give a name, type of geometry and add attributes.

Thanks Richard, makes more sense now. Just a shame it is not implemented
directly in QGIS, rather than being a plug-in.

Cheers,

Giuseppe Sucameli implemented layer import functionality for both
PostGIS and SpatiaLite within this year's GSoC. The code is not
integrated into master branch yet, but hopefully it will be integrated
soon.

Hi,

Here is a potential new logo for Quantum GIS 2 (done by Sylvain Beorchia) ->

http://imageshare.web.id/images/qvqacswmv59l9rjxl1g6.png

The actual is too complex with its gradients and shadows, here is a more 
simple logo which keeps most of the original design but a clearer way. 
The image linked above shows how it looks like at small size.

By itself this change is worth creating a 2.0 git tag and to ship as 
soon as possible, it will increases our marketshare over 9000% !

I like the idea of simplifying QGIS logo a lot.
I never understood what is the point of arrow in QGIS logo? Can it be just stylized

While I think the QGIS icon needs a revamp for 2.0 I'm not sure that new one
does it for me personally.

I have been in contact with a company here in Australia who said they are
happy to sponsor a 99designs.com (http://99designs.com/logo-design) competition
for the new QGIS logo.  The best part is that you can do the competition but
if you don't like the designs you don't have to pick on.

Thoughts?

+1 for a logo contest if possible.

If we change the QGIS icon and logo for 2.0, I would even go as far a not
restricting the color palette at all. No need to stick to yellow/green if
something else would suite the project better.

Best wishes,
Anita

+1 for a logo competition.

Then a sub category - (optional) icon set that matches with the submitted logo.

The maker of the winning logo + icon set would have the privilege to
be acknowledge (post URL) in the "About PopUp form" of the QGIS
releases.

I think this would encourage established icon designers (i.e.
individuals and companies) to submit their entry for the competition.

This event - icon competition would also promotes QGIS.

What do you think about the ideas?
