Hi Tim.
This is the point: according to what I hear, the system is not working very
well, both for users (I often receive requests like "when will I be able to use
version 1.2? When will be feature yyy available to general public?) and for
packagers (we still miss proper official packages for Debian, and therefore also
for all derived distros). My suggestion came from their requests.

Don't you think an alternative approach is easier?
Since the code base is mostly quite stable (always compiling smoothly, only 3
critical bugs left), I think we can basically release any time, without major
issues. So why not deciding fixed times, and release the best code we have twice
a year?
Anyway, *you* are the release manager, and I respect your decision :)
I'm raising the point only to make users happy, and to have good packages,
especially for Debian and derivatives. This would also help preparing
documentation in time, I think.
All the best.

Yes that is why we requested people to move feature development into
branches always - to keep svn trunk in a near release ready state.

Like I said in the previous post I am happy to try doing fixed date
releases again.

To be honest I have given up trying to figure out the various arcane
requirements needed for debian packages. I understand the need for
quality control but most of the things they ask for are beyond my
understanding. If we are ever to meet their criteria I think we need a
bit more hand holding. Juergen has carried out their requests as they
have come up as best I can recall, but I think even his seemingly
limitless persistence must be wearing out by now.

Message-ID: <b2de29ac0908010824q31c1b56do30a9dbf55a35d767@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Just a reminder that we are in a 2 week feature freeze in trunk
starting today. Only bug fixes should be committed until we branch for
release in 3 weeks time. On the 14 we will enter string freeze and I
will put out a call for translations. On the 21st we will branch for
release at which point only packaging related changes should go into
the release branch and normal commit activity can resume in trunk.

If anyone has a particular planetary moon preference for the name of
the 1.2 release, lets hear it! I would like to suggest "Daphnis" as it
is the sister to Pan in the A Ring of
Saturn....http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Saturn

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help needed in creating Third Level Submenu
Message-ID: <78e951a60908030557x289988eak8a107bde1717afc@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am trying to create THIRD LEVEL MENU  through the following code. Like I
have a menu Called "Boundaries", inside that I have sub menu called
"Division", inside that I have "Division_name", inside "Division Name" we
have a separate sub menu called "Division Range", on clicking on the sub
menu "Division range" some action is done, like opening the range boundary
shape file. I am able to open the Shape file portion, but I am getting error
in the Bold Line marked as "AttributeError: addActions"

        self.menu = QMenu()
        self.menu.setTitle( "Boundaries" )

        self.DM = QMenu( "Division" )
        self.Div1 = QAction( QIcon( ":/icons/find.png" ), "Division
Name",self.iface.getMainWindow() )
        self.DM.addActions( [ self.Div1])
        self.menu.addMenu( self.DM )
        menuBar = self.iface.getMainWindow().menuBar()
        menuBar.addMenu(self.menu)

        self.Div_Range = QAction( QIcon( ":/icons/find.png" ), "Division
Range",self.iface.getMainWindow() )
        *self.Div1.addActions( [ self.Div_Range])*
        self.menu.addMenu( self.Div_Range )
        menuBar = self.iface.getMainWindow().menuBar()
        menuBar.addMenu(self.menu)

        QObject.connect( self.Div_Range, SIGNAL("triggered()"),
self.Div1_Clicked )

It will be of immense help, if anybody can point the error in the code, or
is it like THIRD LEVEL SUBMENU is not supported in QGIS?

I am using QGIS 0.11, Python 2.5 and QT.

I am posting the same in the QGIS Developer forum

Thanking you in advance,

With Warm Regards

Hi Bishwarup, the addActions method is in QWidget class, and QAction don't
inherited from that. So addActions don't exist for QAction. Maybe you can
use QtDesigner to create the menu level you want and then generate the .py
with pyuirc4, this way you can see how to create it.

Why you don't use the last QGis version?

Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E0149FABB9B@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi,

Is there any reason why I have to copy the ECW libs (NCScnet.dll, NCSEcw.dll, NCSEcwC.dll, NCSUtil.dll) into the qgis app directory (%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\qgis\bin) to get ECW support? When I place the libs into the %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin directory, ECW support for gdal 1.5 and 1.6 works fine, but qgis does not register the format.

I'm getting the same results on QGIS version 1.02, 1.1 and1.2 (trunk), on an up to date installation of OSGeo4W. My OS is WinXP SP2.

Cheers
Jeremy

Hi German,

Thank you very much for your reply. I will try to incorporate the way you
suggested. But, I thing I was wondering is that if "addActions" does not
inherits from QAction, then how is that when I go to only second level of
submenu option, instead of thrird level, it works fine. The problem arises
only when we go to the third level.

With warm Regards,
Bishwarup

Should Qgis work with Qt 4.5?  I haven't seen any definitive comments

So far there are two bug (on OSX at least) that are connected to Qt 4.5.

Works fine as far as I can see, but I don't have OSX.

Both only affect OSX.

And I don't think the second one is even related to Qt 4.5.  I think there's
are problem with the OSX headers files.  http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/270
might also relate to that.

Does replacing 

#include <cmath> 

with

#include <math.h>

in src/core/qgis.h help?

Is it OK to add transparency setting into the render context? This would make it much easier to
cache point symbols with transparency.

Hi list,

My goal is to develop a C++ plugin, which will run under QGIS. I'm
developing under Linux and having trouble making compiled plugin binary
work under Windows. Here is what I did:

I compiled QGIS from svn under Linux for Windows using Cmake and MinGW.
Then I tried to put compiled plugins in plugins folder for MSVC build
QGIS from http://qgis.org/en/download/unstable-software.html.
But after I run OSGeo/QGIS it does not see this plugins.

I then run MinGW/QGIS with its plugins and QGIS was able to load my
plugin under Win without problems. But when I put plugins from MSVC
build QGIS to MinGW build QGIS it cannot see them again.

My question is, does anybody know how to tune MinGW to build compatible
binaries of plugins whith MSVC build QGIS?

I will appreciate any advice.

Hi all,

I'd like to announce new version of Statist plugin. It's available in
GIS-Lab repository (http://gis-lab.info/programs/qgis/qgis-repo.xml).
In this version:
  - added some new parameters to the statistics output
  - switching between histogram and plot representation
  - added navigation toolbar to move around histogram
  - user can change histogram interval
  - fixed bug with histogram resizing
and some other additions and fixes. Documentation available online at
GIS-Lab (thanks to Maxim Dubinin):
  - in Russian http://gis-lab.info/qa/statist.html

Hello QGISers and especially Borys,

Experienced something stange today with Plugin installer. One of the
3rd party repos went offline (Barry's), but instead of gracefully
letting me now about this, Plugin installer kept showing this error
and as a result didn't work at all:

***************************************************************
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis-dev/./python/plugins\plugin_installer\installer_plugin.py", line 162, in run
    QMessageBox.warning(parent, QCoreApplication.translate("QgsPluginInstaller","QGIS Python Plugin Installer"), QCoreApplication.translate("QgsPluginInstaller","Error reading repository:") + u' %s\n%s' % (key,repositories.all()[key]["error"]))
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'QString' and 'unicode'
***************************************************************

My solution was to go in the code and comment a portion that
complained and after it finally was able to load up - remove Barry's repo (sorry
Barry). Then I restored the code to the original and everything back
to normal.

This might be something very specific, but may be worth looking into.

Hi Jack

You need to compile your plugin with the same compiler QGIS is compiled with (e.g. you need to use msvc to compile plugins that run with the msvc build). This is because every C++ compiler has its own calling convention, so you cannot link binaries of different compilers. This is only possible with C code, where you have a much simpler and standardised calling convention compared to C++.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Magnus

How would you add the transparency to the render context?
The rendercontext is meant to contain information about the rendering procedure as a whole (so not information that is layer or even symbol specific). Is it perhaps possible to extend the cache such that it stores the transparency value for which it is valid (and the resolution, that would be great for printing)? 

Regards,
Marco

Thanks, I probably misunderstood the purpose of the render context.

Yes, the cache stores transparency, but to send the wanted transprancey down from QgsVectorLayer through QgsRenderer to QgsSymbol requiers an extra parameter in the interfaces. Maybe that's the best way?

Well, if we want to keep it within Qgsvectorlayer, we could:
1) Set alpha channel dynamically, or
2) Cache in QgsVectorLayer

Bishwarup, you can use addActions in your self.DM object because it is an
instance of QMenu, which inherits from QWidget. While your self.Div1 is an
instance of QAction which doesn't inherits from QWidget, so self.Div1 can't
access to addActions method.

Take a look at this: http://doc.qtsoftware.com/4.5/classes.html

Hi Magnus

>2) Cache in QgsVectorLayer

What do you mean with 'set alpha channel dynamically'?

Adding an extra parameter to the interfaces, as you suggested, sounds reasonable to me. Keep attention to add default values for it in the function signatures (to not break API compatibility for plugins and third party applications).

Marco

Thanks, I probably misunderstood the purpose of the render context.

Yes, the cache stores transparency, but to send the wanted transprancey down from QgsVectorLayer through QgsRenderer to QgsSymbol requiers an extra parameter in the interfaces. Maybe that's the best way?

Well, if we want to keep it within Qgsvectorlayer, we could:
1) Set alpha channel dynamically, or
2) Cache in QgsVectorLayer

Tim and others,
In Hannover you (Tim) have hidden the Add feature tool button unless the editing 
mode is active. All other buttons are just getting greyed. Actually I find this 
behaviour a bit ugly, as all the followed buttons are moving left and right one 
place when entering and leaving the editing mode. 

What about restoring button to be always visible (probably the point one looks 
the most universal) and just set the tooltip to the universal form 'add 
feature'?

Message-ID: <E6FA5031-1A1E-4561-8409-E7EF2C6CFC76@KYNGCHAOS.COM>

Looks like the isnan problem is fixed.  For the font problem in  
labelling, I wonder if it has something to do with the fact that Qt  
4.5 now uses native font selection dialog on OSX:

> QFileDialog

> On Mac, native dialogs are now used when calling show, open, or exec  
> on a QFileDialog, QColorDialog, QPrintDialog, or QFontDialog (i.e  
> not only when using the static functions)

So maybe the font spec is returned in an OSX form?  Or something like  
that?

Way beyond me.  If anyone can help (I don't know if anyone's watching  
it):

Hi lists,

I just want you to know that I created a german QGIS compiling tutorial
using msvc and the osgeo4w package under windows xp (I didn't find a
tutorial which uses osgeo4w).
If anyone of you is interested you can find the pdf in the attachment. A
HTML-Version will be released within the next days I hope.

I hope that this is helpful to anyone.

Thanks to Tim Sutton, David Willis und J?rgen Fischer for your tutorial,
which I related to.

Best regards,

Great. Note that when there's no layer or the active layer is raster, one of the 
icons has to be chosen arbitrary anyway, so there was my suggestion from.

I haven't been closely monitoring QGIS recently. Since you offered a 
theory that was easy to check, I checked.

QFontDialog for Qt 4.5/Mac uses a new Cocoa implementation which appears 
to work for some fonts in a 64-bit build but not at all in a 32-bit 
build (at least within QGIS).

> So maybe the font spec is returned in an OSX form?  Or something like that?

Qt provides access functions and QGIS uses them so the problems are 
within QFontDialog.

The fix is to force use of the Qt non-native font dialog (same as Qt 
4.4) in 32-bit builds until QFontDialog is fixed.

I posted some fixes for the map composer as well. If one of you wants  
to commit those, we can probably close this until we get some  
confirmation that qt has fixed the issue. Or do we leave it open?

Hi Magnus

The way to pass opacity as rendering argument looks good, thank you for fixing the transparency issue!

Still there is an issue with backwards compatibility. The purpose of b.c. is that plugins and third party apps don't need to be changed for the 1.x versions.

Take QgsRenderer and assume someone wrote a plugin or an application that has its custom renderer class (e.g. QGIS mapserver has QgsSLDRenderer which implements a rule based renderer as in SLD).
Now QgsRenderer changed to:

void renderFeature(QPainter* p, QgsFeature& f,QImage* pic, bool selected, double widthScale = 1.0, double rasterScaleFactor = 1.0);
void renderFeature( QgsRenderContext &renderContext, QgsFeature& f, QImage* pic, bool selected );
virtual void renderFeature( QgsRenderContext &renderContext, QgsFeature& f, QImage* pic, bool selected, double opacity ) = 0;

This means that QgsSLDRenderer needs to add the third function, otherwise the compiler complains and the vector layer won't call the old function (compatibility broken).

Isn't it possible to work with default arguments? As far as I see from the .sip files, SIP supports the use of default arguments such that API compatibility also would work for the bindings. But I'm not an export in SIP, so please Martin or someone else correct me if I'm wrong.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] A suggestion for "Scale and measurement"
Message-ID: <4A7D31D3.9060703@homann.se>

Many bugs have been reported against scale and measuremetns value. Often, it is simply coonfusion about
the intended behaviour. However, ther might also be some buyggity involved, especially with the scale bar plugin.

See for instance https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1219 and https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1433
for current status.

I propose we change the wording on the units selector to "Default layer units when OTF Projections is turned off",
and gray this area out when OTFP is on. We also add another selector (maybe in global options instead of project options?)
called "Measurement presentation units:  (*) Metric  (*) Imperial".

Changing any of these must send a signal, being picked up by the scale bar unit and the QgsMeasureDialog.

A question is what to display when a) OTFP is off and the layer unit selected is degrees, or
b) OTFP is on and the map CRS is geo (such as WGS84). Should we use sq. degrees or should we
convert distances/areas on an ellipsoid?

Can I fix this to 1,2, or is it too late?

I my opinion we should do the latter,. Thoughts? It would be great if 
this made it in time for this next release...

And what about automatic unit switching depending on the layer  range? As long 
values are <= +-180, it can be considered as degrees. If the coordinates are > 
180, the unit could be set to meters or feet depending on the user settings, as 
Magnus said ('We also add another selector (maybe in global options instead of 
project options?) called "Measurement presentation units:  (*) Metric  (*) 
Imperial".')

Hi!

I  made the upgrade to the latest version of the plugin (2.3).

Thanks for fixing that small gui problem under linux.


Now I'm noticing that with both postgis and grass layers the plugin
crashes qgis. This are the messages:

One of the use cases is american building engineer drawing a house plan in feet.
There is no automatic way of detecting that.

Using layer CRS when OTFP is off doesn't sound logical to me. The CRS doesn't matter
in any other case in QGIS when OTFP is off.

Hi, 

after we used a backup of the QGIS web and wiki to provide the platforms again
on another server, the osgeo server seems to work again :). We will test it
soon and switch back when everything is ok. In the meanwhile I would like to ask
you not to contribute any content to the current web or wiki pages. 

The resaon is, that the installation on the osgeo server is more up to date
compared with the backup we use now. 

@Carson: I will migrate your Manual Task entries manually then.

Thanks for your patience

Hi Florian,

here is English translation with few bugs fixed (note new cmake gui,
some links, paths to osgeo4w\qt etc.)

in general QGIS compiles and run well using this approach, but I could not
make Python support work.

it also would be nice to add explanations on adding debugging output.

thanks for your work.

Hi Maxim,

thanks for the translation. I already tried to translate it by myself, but
I will change some formulations - so thanks for that!

I already fixed some of the bugs you mentioned in the newest version,
which you can found under:
http://www.florianhillen.de/qgis-tutorial-de.html (German)
http://www.florianhillen.de/qgis-tutorial-en.html (English)
But what do you mean with the new cmake gui? I think it's looking the
same, isn't it?!?

I have the same problem with python at the moment. I don't need python so
far, but I will try to fix that problem and change that part of the
tutorial.
The same with debugging - didn't take a look at that until now.

Best regards,
Florian

Dear Qgis,

I'm a transportation engineer that loves your product. I've started to
brainstorm a transportation plugin for QGIS. I created a menu of the
features I use most, and that are found in some of the commercial software
I use (the menu plugin is attached to this email). I was wondering if
anyone is interested in helping out and/or commenting.

p.s. untar the file to your .qgis/python/plugins directory and enable it
from the plugin menu

cheers,

Message-ID: <e32d76a10908112043n8ddf6e7q2209a4f600424140@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all. I'm trying to emulate the symbology dialog for a Python application
but I have a trouble.

When I'm working with QgsGraduatedSymbolRenderer and I try to save the style
to a qml file using the saveNamedStyle() method I get the following message:


Could not save symbology because:

renderer failed to save
And in the command line:
NotImplementedError: QgsGraduatedSymbolRenderer.writeXML() is abstract and
must be overridden

With the other renderer classes (QgsContinuousColorRenderer,
QgsSingleSymbolRenderer, QgsUniqueValueRenderer) the saveNamedStyle()
method  works well and the qml file is saved without any problem.

Do you know why can this be happen?


Thanks in advance.

Germ?n

I suspect this might be due missing 'const' classifier in
QgsGraduatedSymbolRenderer wrapper.

In python/core/qgsgraduatedsymbolrenderer.sip, line 68:
virtual bool writeXML( QDomNode & layer_node, QDomDocument & document,
QgsVectorLayer& vl ) const;
Try to alter "QgsVectorLayer&" to "const QgsVectorLayer&" and
recompile the bindings.

If it helps, please give me feedback and I'll fix it in SVN.

Hi,

 

I have a plugin that works fine the first time you run it. Then, when
you try to restart the plugin, I get this error: 

 

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "C:/Documents and
Settings/m29308/.qgis//python/plugins\NoblisPostGISGraphs\NoblisPostGISG

I can't figure out why it is complaining about argument 3-self.graph is
a method name and not only does it work the first time around, other
connections are also fine. The only difference is that self.graph takes
in a list.

 

In PostGISdialog

                                self.tablesToGraph=list(tablesToGraph)

 

Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <5d854a700908120703j48bc762bnf3c62b3d1323dd71@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Guys,

I'm with a little problem here trying to "colormaping" a raster.

Here is the code that adds a raster:
http://pastebin.com/m3d57d2e2

Where:
- AddRasterLayer is the method that adds a layer to the canvas,
- qgsImage is the qgsMapCanvas
- mclLayerSet is the list of the MapLayers
- ui.twPalette is a TreeWidget that holds the colormap

In this point,
myRasterShaderFunction->setColorRampItemList( myColorRampItems );

The application exits abnormally.

That's anything that I need to configure in the raster before set this
variable?

Anyone could help this desperated developer?

Best Regards,
------------------------------

Hey guys,

I've solved the problem.

It was just use the function :


mRasterLayer->setRasterShaderFunction(myRasterShaderFunction);

at the end of the applypalette() , and and create the myRasterShaderFunction
this way:

 QgsColorRampShader* myRasterShaderFunction = new QgsColorRampShader(0,255);

instead of this way:

QgsRasterLayer * mypLayer = new
 QgsRasterLayer(myRasterFileInfo.filePath(),myRasterFileInfo.
completeBaseName());

Sergio,

Glad you found a solution. This highlights something of a problem that 
has come up before in the raster class itself, it has to do with the cast

QgsColorRampShader* myRasterShaderFunction = ( 
QgsColorRampShader*)mRasterLayer->rasterShader()->rasterShaderFunction();

and the need to get to methods specific to the shader. In this case the 
cast will work even if the current shader function is not a color ramp 
shader, but of course when you go to use it as a color ramp shader, 
crash. I think the solution is to use dynamic_cast then check to make 
sure the pointer is not null.

I think it also might be useful if the shaders had ids or names as 
another way of knowing what type of shader you currently have. If you 
think this would be helpful, feel free to file a ticket so that it can 
be added to the growing todo list.

I found a solution too. I simply changed the name of graph method to
graphblah.

 

It's a weird solution but QObject.connect(self.PostGISdialog,
SIGNAL("Graph"), self.graphblah) works perfectly now. Perhaps it was the
length of the method name??

Hi all.
There are 5 patches in the trac:

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1716

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/62

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1855

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1863

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1869

We have applied and tested them (thanks Giovanni), and they seem to work well. I
would suggest to lifte the freeze to include them, unless someone who inspected
the code finds problems. I think the release of 1.2 is an important landmark,
and it would be good to have as many issues fixed as possible.
Any objections?
Thanks.

It is up to Tim to decide.

My personal opinion: I think it is better to include those new features into 1.3 for stability reasons (that's the purpose of feature freeze after all).

Of course, if you think there is a risk of instability, better to postpone it. I
suggested it because they do not seemed invasive.
All the best.

Hi,

none of them is fundamental, but they fix/add useful things for the
users, so if it is really not a big stability problem I would like (as
user) to see them in 1.2

I tested them and does not seems to me that my compiled copy of qgis is
having stability issues.

thanks

#62 might be very invasive.  Previously there was not explicit type for feature
ids and therefore we might find a lot of places where there are ints now, which
are feature ids, but were not touched because they were not yet identified as
such.  That's a potential source for breakages.

The others IMHO are harmless.  If we weren't in feature freeze, I would have
applied them already.  But they aren't too important either, so I don't see a
urgent need for lifting the feature freeze just for those.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mouse Behaviour in print composer
Message-ID: <2e96f329878382295498f13a153c27ae@127.0.0.1>

Hey all,

I wonder if anyone can replicate this situation on the following system:
* Ubuntu 9.04, QGIS 1.1.0-Pan
* A mouse with a "back button"(the button is in an odd place and tends to
get pressed accidently)

Situation:
In print composer, while moving an object, clicking the mouse's back button
causes QGIS to crash. It's really not even considered a nuisance, but I
wonder, if it's just my crappy mouse or something else.

Cheers,
Dassouki

Hey All,

I was wondering if anyone can help me load an attribute column into a numpy
array http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.html . I?m not
necessary looking for the full code, rather than a pseudo code.  For
example, a layer that has columns A, B, C, I'd like to load all the values
in column C into the array. 


Thank you

Could you consider to commit also the patch I sent a few days ago to
this list that introduces some strings from fTools for translation. I
think it shouldn't break anything and will improve internationalization
of 1.2 release.

The only way to do this is to parse the layer's attribute table.
Something like the following:

id = provider.fieldNameIndex( 'field_name' )
rows = []
while provider.nextFeature( feat ):
    data = feat.attributeMap()[ id ]
    do something with row data *
    row = [ data ]
    rows.append( row )
array = numpy.array( rows )

    * here data will be a QVariant,
    so you'll have to do the appropriate
    manipulation to get the data type
    you want, if you want all the columns
    you could probably unzip the dict of
    attributes returned by attributeMap()
    and simply set row equal to that,
    just be careful, as dicts aren't stored
    in any particular order. In this case
    the keys are the columns ids

Sorry for cross-posting to all lists but I think thats important for all

Hi to all!

So we're getting closer and closer to the next Hackfest!
I've been in Hotel Modul today and talked to them .. 

For Paolo and all people wanting a room in Hotel Modul: The rooms are
bookable to the reduced price (88? per person and night) with the CODE
"CAVALLINI" - And they are held back until 24th of August (thats rather
close)
email: rezeptionmodul@wkw.at
If there are any problems contact: alexandra.kunzmann@wkw.at (thats the
person i talkde to - and she knows all)

Allthough Hotel modul is the very closest to our "Meeting point" at
university I personally think it's not so cheap - so I searched for a
cheaper one - and found one ..

For the people not so "rich" ;)

http://www.hotel-pension-gersthof.at

I where there - It seems to be ok. 
They have 2 single rooms and 6 double room - with "first come -first
serve" - If you want a room there (its about 700m to university) write
to office@hotel-pension-gersthof.at

(double room 55-69? per night, single room 39? per night - breakfast 5?)

If you have any problems contacting them you can write an email to me
(but I can't guarantee if theres still room left ;) )

Hope that mail will clearify all the missunderstandings from the past ..

regards
Werner

Hi Anibal

QGIS_CORE_LIBRARY                /home/anibal/apps/lib


QGIS_GUI_LIBRARY                 /home/anibal/apps/lib

I think the above should be pointing to the actual .so files ie.
libqgis_core and libqgis_gui.

Regards

Tim

I think we should wait with these other mentioned patches for 1.3. It
should be fine to commit Carlos' patch it it relates only to translations.

I will be calling for translations tomorrow evening late (South African
time) after which now more string changes should be introduced.

Thanks to you for finding the error. I'll correct it after "call for

Hi Ahmed

What does the 'back' button do if you select an item and click it (without moving). I wonder to which button / key the 'back' button is linked.

>* Ubuntu 9.04, QGIS 1.1.0-Pan

Best thing is to try it with a current development version. Many changes have been done since 1.1.0.

Regards,
Marco

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Mouse Behaviour in print composer
 
Hey all,

I wonder if anyone can replicate this situation on the following system:
* Ubuntu 9.04, QGIS 1.1.0-Pan
* A mouse with a "back button"(the button is in an odd place and tends to
get pressed accidently)

Situation:
In print composer, while moving an object, clicking the mouse's back button
causes QGIS to crash. It's really not even considered a nuisance, but I
wonder, if it's just my crappy mouse or something else.

Cheers,
Dassouki

Hi All

We are entering a week string freeze prior to putting out a call for
packaging on the 21st. Werner could you unleash the mighty hordes of GUI
translators and get any contributions they wish to make into SVN by the
21st?

Developers you can continue with bug fixes in trunk but any string
changes should be avoided.

The release checklist is here:

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Release_Checklist_1.2

Many thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ticket #1877: ui/rc files in python plugins
Message-ID: <20090815162530.GA24122@norbit.de>

Hi,

after I noticed that some generated python ui files were missing from the osm
plugin, I've added some code to osmplugins's CMakeLists.txt to build the python
files automatically - for that plugin.

I've extended that a bit and made a patch that moves that to
cmake/Python.cmake, removes all generated files from the plugins and modifies
their CMakeLists.txt to recreate them automatically on build (just like for C++
UIs).

The patch is attached to ticket #1877 on TRAC.  Would the python people please
review the patch?

Hi tim
Now start compile, but at the end get another error:

ccmake ..
c
g

 CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:79 (ADD_EXECUTABLE):
   Policy CMP0003 should be set before this line.  Add code such as

     if(COMMAND cmake_policy)
       cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW)
     endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)

   as early as possible but after the most recent call to
   cmake_minimum_required or cmake_policy(VERSION).  This warning
appears
   because target "timtut2" links to some libraries for which the linker
must
   search:

     -lpthread, -ldl, -lpthread, -ldl

   and other libraries with known full path:

     /home/anibal/apps/lib/libqgis_core.so

   CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search
path in
   case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for
backwards
   compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to
enable
   or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy
CMP0003" for
   more information.
 This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.


If I try with cmake .. and after make:

I thought I'd take a stab at updating the install/build instructions  
for OSX again, and want to make sure I do it right this time.  Edit  
doc/INSTALL.t2t?

So it looks like your Qt4 install is not being found properly either.
Can you post :

- - the cmake settings you have for the various Qt libs
- - the ccmake command line + options you used when you initially ran ccmake

Thanks

uhm... my bad. I was in a hurry leaving for a weekend when committing,
so no wonder I've messed that...

This is exactly what I've been too lazy to do :-)
The patch looks good, please apply it.

Hi

Please don't attach such large attachments unless they are solicited. In
general you should upload them to a photo sharing service and just mail

NSPLUGIN and MOTIF stuff you can safely ignore I think. I did a test
build of timtut2 here just to be sure it was all still working ok. It
compiles fine against QGIS 1.2 'Daphnis'. Here is what I have on my
ccmake screen:

 CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY    2.4


 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE


 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX             /usr/local


 EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH


 GDAL_CONFIG                      /home/timlinux/apps/bin/gdal-config


 GDAL_CONFIG_PREFER_PATH          /bin


 GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR                 /usr/local/include


 GDAL_LIBRARY                     /usr/lib/libgdal1.6.0.so


 GEOS_INCLUDE_DIR                 /usr/include


 GEOS_LIBRARY                     /usr/lib/libgeos.so


 LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH


 QGIS_CORE_LIBRARY
/home/timlinux/apps/qgis_trunk/lib/libqgis_core.so

 QGIS_GUI_LIBRARY
/home/timlinux/apps/qgis_trunk/lib/libqgis_gui.so

 QGIS_INCLUDE_DIR
/home/timlinux/apps/qgis_trunk/include/qgis

 QGIS_PLUGIN_DIR
/home/timlinux/apps/qgis_trunk/lib/qgis

 QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE              /usr/bin/qmake


Also check your QGIS_INCLUDE_DIR (press 't' first to toggle on advanced
settings) is set correctly - on my system it looks like:

 QT_QT_INCLUDE_DIR                /usr/include/qt4/Qt

Hope that helps. I suggest asking your tiff question in a separate
thread as it will be lost to other devs if you bury it in an existing
thread.

Hi

Just a note - your wiki page states:

"Old (rpy) working configurations (note: you often will need to purchase
packages out from aptitude and similar tools, and HomeRange plugin
v<2.0.0!):"

It may be better to change the wording from 'purchase' to 'obtain' as
currently it creates the impression that you need to buy something in
order to use the plugin.

Regards

Tim

Ok this is a general QGIS compilation error you should ask on the list.
There have been quite a few python related updates in the last few days
and you may have caught a snapshot in the middle of them. Try updating
svn and then doing:

cd build
ccmake ..
c
g
make install

(to force regeneration of make files)

Did you say you used 'aplica' as your qgis install path? mPluginsDir
should match...

Run ldd on your generated binary and check that it has libs referenced
properly for each (in particular Qt) lib. See my example below this
message. If not you should either:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path to qt lib dir>

or (system wide so use sudo)

edit /etc/ld.so.conf

add the path to qt lib dir there

run ldconfig


Then try to run the binary again.

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OGRSpatialReference problem in QGIS
Message-ID: <3461.79.205.41.138.1250520133.squirrel@webmail.rz.uni-osnabrueck.de>

Hi list,

I have a problem with OGR in Quantum GIS.

For my Plugin which reprojects rasterdata to another CS, I need a WKT
description of the new CS. With the QgsProjectionSelector I can select a
CS and read out the epsg code or the proj4 string. But I fail by setting
this to an OGRSpatialReference and export that to a WKT.
If I transform a 4326 scene with my plugin to 31467 (german system), the
gdal warp works correctly (the coordinates are right), but the information
about the geocs looks like this:

PROJCS["unnamed",PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",9],PARAMETER["scale_factor",1],PARAMETER["false_easting",3500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["Meter",1]]

Here is the code in which I set the OSR:

    OGRSpatialReference oSRS;

    long epsg = projectSelector->selectedEpsg();

    if(epsg == 0)
        return false;

    if(epsg == 4326)
    {
        QString epsgString;
        epsgString.setNum(epsg);
        epsgString.prepend("EPSG:");
        oSRS.SetWellKnownGeogCS(epsgString.toUtf8());
    }
    else
    {
        oSRS.SetProjCS((projectSelector->selectedName()).toUtf8());
        oSRS.importFromProj4((projectSelector->selectedProj4String()).toUtf8());
    }

    oSRS.exportToWkt( &pszDstWKT );

The if-clause for 4326 was just a try to use an other function, so don't
focus on that too much.

Can anyone help me with that?
Do I have to use the C-API for that? I already had problems with the C++
API of GDAL in Quantum GIS. My first attempt with the C-API for OGR wasn't
successful either, that's why I asked you for a hint.

Thanks in advance and best regards,
Florian

Florian,

What did the Proj4String look like?  The WKT is lacking any description of
the GEOGCS which suprises me.  I'm not clear on where the proj.4 strings
in projectSelector->selectedProj4String() come from but if this string is
reasonable and has earth model information it should be reflected in the WKT.
If not, perhaps I can fix importFromProj4.

Best regards,

Hi Frank,

thanks for the fast answer.
(projectSelector->selectedProj4String()).toUtf8() delivers the following
proj.4 string:

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=1 +x_0=3500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=bessel
+datum=potsdam +units=m +no_defs

What about avoiding the problem with something similar to this?

QString wkt = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(
		projectionSelector->selectedCrsId(),
		QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::InternalCrsId ).toWkt();


I would try to avoid the C++-API and use the C-API to avoid ABI headaches.

Hi J?rgen,

thanks for that workaround. It works good, but delivers the same WKT:

PROJCS["unnamed",
GEOGCS["unnamed",
DATUM["unknown",
SPHEROID["unretrievable - using WGS84",6378137,298.257223563]],
PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],
UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],
PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],
PARAMETER["central_meridian",9],
PARAMETER["scale_factor",1],
PARAMETER["false_easting",3500000],
PARAMETER["false_northing",0],
UNIT["metre",1,
AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]]]

Florian,

This proj.4 string works fine for me producing:

PROJCS["unnamed",
     GEOGCS["DHDN",
         DATUM["Deutsches_Hauptdreiecksnetz",
             SPHEROID["Bessel 1841",6377397.155,299.1528128,
                 AUTHORITY["EPSG","7004"]],
             TOWGS84[606,23,413,0,0,0,0],
             AUTHORITY["EPSG","6314"]],
         PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
             AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],
         UNIT["degree",0.01745329251994328,
             AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],
         AUTHORITY["EPSG","4314"]],
     PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],
     PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],
     PARAMETER["central_meridian",9],
     PARAMETER["scale_factor",1],
     PARAMETER["false_easting",3500000],
     PARAMETER["false_northing",0],
     UNIT["Meter",1]]

I see this code in importFromProj4() for "datum=potsdam":

     else if( EQUAL(pszValue,"potsdam") )
     {
         OGRSpatialReference oGCS;
         oGCS.importFromEPSG( 4314 );
         CopyGeogCSFrom( &oGCS );
         bFullyDefined = TRUE;
     }

This leads me to suspect that the EPSG .csv files are not being found.  These
have the names gcs.csv and pcs.csv, are distributed as part of GDAL and are
normally found somewhere like /usr/local/share/gdal/.  When in an unusual
location you can use the GDAL_DATA environment variable to point to the
directory holding them.

This import code should really have some error checking to propogate a failure
in importFromEPSG() back to the importFromProj4() caller.  If you would file
a GDAL ticket on this issue, I'll have someone work on improving the error
handling.  But the core solution is to ensure the support files are available
and findable.

Best regards,

Hi Frank,

you're right. I use the OSGeo4W package under windows, so the files are in
C:\OSGeo4W\share\gdal and no environment variable is set.

After setting this, the GEOGCS seems to be recognized, but same problem
with datum and spheroid:

PROJCS["unnamed",
GEOGCS["DHDN",
DATUM["unknown",
SPHEROID["unretrievable - using WGS84",6378137,298.257223563]],
PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],
UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433],
AUTHORITY["EPSG","4314"]],
PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],
PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],
PARAMETER["central_meridian",9],
PARAMETER["scale_factor",1],
PARAMETER["false_easting",3500000],
PARAMETER["false_northing",0],
UNIT["metre",1,
AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]]]

Do I have to set any other variable or something to fix that?

I will file a ticket by quoting you, thanks for your help so far!

Florian

Florian,

On my system the qgis 1.0 icon runs the \osgeo4w\apps\gis\qgis.bat
file which runs \osgeo4w\bin\gdal16.bat which sets the GDAL_DATA
environment variable to \osgeo4w\apps\gdal-16\share\data which seems
appropriate.

If I run the command:

   gdal_translate -a_srs "+proj=latlong +datum=potsdam" in.tif out.tif

I get a file with an SRS like I expect instead of the unretreivable
values you get.

I cannot easily test from within qgis.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <5d854a700908171013l7648b5dap479e22308a916613@mail.gmail.com>

People, can anyone give me a little help with my transparency function?
Here is it:

void CViewPort::SetRasterTransparent(QgsRasterLayer * mRasterLayer)

{

  double myTransparentValue;

  double myPercentTransparent;


  QgsRasterTransparency::TransparentSingleValuePixel myTransparentPixel;

  QList<QgsRasterTransparency::TransparentSingleValuePixel>
myTransparentSingleValuePixelList;


  myTransparentPixel.pixelValue = 0.00;

  myTransparentPixel.percentTransparent = 100.00;

  myTransparentSingleValuePixelList.append( myTransparentPixel );


  myTransparentPixel.pixelValue = 65.00;

  myTransparentPixel.percentTransparent = 100.00;

  myTransparentSingleValuePixelList.append( myTransparentPixel );


  mRasterLayer->rasterTransparency()->setTransparentSingleValuePixelList(
myTransparentSingleValuePixelList );

}

The pixels I need to become transparent are the 0 and 65. I put the same
values on the quantum gis application transparent pixel list and they become
transparent, but I couldn't get the same result in my app.

Martin,

I thought I'd check in on your progress today, but was unable to  
successfully build the symbology-ng branch. I'm not sure if you are  
ready for testing, but here is the error:

Hi John,

try r11420, it should have this error fixed.

I dont have binary, cant check libs referenced

I do export... and nano /etc/ld.so.conf after run ldconfig but nothing

I found this link thats some similar... in akonadi framework of KDE

http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-buildsystem/2008-July/004877.html


I do not know if it would fix

Thanks in advance
Best regards

Anibal

This is great progress. I am able to get the symbology classified and  
used on a quick test of a roads file. I did not play around with  
creating new symbols. Labels do not appear to be working. I did not  
see an option for labels following lines, etc. I assume that is still  
underway, perhaps lacking the appropriate means to enact this via the  
properties dialog. Choosing to display labels and selecting a name  
field did not produce any labels on the canvas.

Thank you much,
John

John,

I guess you've been setting labeling in the vector layer properties
dialog, right? The new labeling engine based on PAL is currently
available as a plugin: enable it in the plugin manager. Then you'll
get "ABC" icon on the toolbar, clicking it will allow you to set
labeling properties for current layer.

Later I'd like to move the code to core library and the labeling
settings will be available directly from layer properties dialog.

Hi,

may be a new feature wish:
ist there an option to have snapping activated for some layers? I don't
mean that while editing the objects snap to layer A but not to layer B.
I mean I have two layers that are in editingmode and while editing layer
A snapping is active but while editing layer B editing is not.

will there be more updates to the INSTALL.t2t and CODING.t2t documents (also

Hi all,
As some of you have noticed, from r11389 the default one-key shortcuts have 
been replaced with unconvenient "Ctrl+something" etc. Is this change really 
necessary? No other way to make the grass console working? Probably I missed 
some discussion about it, but was one of top qgis conveniences.

I'm afraid advanced users will be angry. Manual setting the shortcuts on every 
machine to the old standard makes rather small sense. Some time ago there was 
a request for shortcut profiles (for office/field purposes) - shouldn't we 
postpone this change to that time?

It's just a question :) Personally, I can just change my shortcuts ;p

Hi Martin,

When you move the new labeling engine to the core - will you make sure
that the capabilities of the existing core labeling will remain intact? We
extensively use the existing mechanisms with data-driven positioning,
orientation, font-properties, color, etc. and it is important that the
existing features remain intact.

I will also try your new plugin in the upcoming days.

Thanks,
Andreas

I agree, one key makes a lot of difference and way more productive
than Ctrl+. Productivity of Photoshop and JOSM is on top partly
because of that.

I did that for:

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/739

Though noone said anything about other platforms than OSX, so I don't  
know if there were problems on other platforms.

 From a UI point of view, I think that menus really shouldn't be using  
plain keystrokes for shortcuts anyways.  Tools, sure.

I just took care of the OSX section for INSTALL.  Mostly OSX specific,  
but there are references to old versions of Qgis and dependencies that  
are in other sections also.  They should either be updated or  
generalized.

Perhaps an option to turn off control key modifiers. A lack of  
modifier is non-conventional to most people and it breaks OS X. As a  
choice, that seems reasonable.

Turning off modifiers would be hard to implement while the shortcuts are 
configurable... Rather something like the mentioned profiles - it sounds best 
for me.

I know it's non-conventional for many people, but it's also inconvenient for 
many others. Personally I can't imagine myself using two fingers for adding a 
layer or doing other common tasks;) The same with other 'one-finger' 
applications, as kmail, where I'm writing from. I understand Mac users are 
irritated having to adjust the shortcuts to run Grass console, but now many 
(maybe more) other users, as me, will have do the same in order to get an 
convenient environment :)

I believe we should either implement shortcuts profiles or at least ask users 
for a voting (both are infeasible before the release). The main problem is 
that if we drop the one-finger shortcuts and update the documentation now, 
reverting this change in the future will look strange ;) So for me doing it 
just before the release is not a good idea...

Anyone else is interested? :)

Thanks for pointing that out. I tested it and it worked well  
initially. I got a crash when I tried to change some of the display  
options, but I do not have details or time right now to help debug.  
Overall, this is very impressive.

One quick note: there is no longer a way to set lines to a "no stroke"  
value. Setting the line width to 0.0 still draws a line. Sometimes it  
is nice to not have lines drawn, but still have labels placed on the  
canvas, e.g. when overlaying symbols on a raster layer.

Cheers,
John

I would just say that having a default setup that breaks functionality  
for a key component of qgis (grass interaction) on one of the  
supported OS's is a bad idea. Better to let people change the  
shortcuts to their preference while providing all functionality to all  
users.

Does calling:

 mRasterLayer->triggerRepaint();

at the end make any difference?

Hello Tim,
Thank's for your reply.

Sadly, no difference. Any other ideas?

Hi Marco

Yes, it is a new feature wish. Currently you can only do that by changing the snap settings by hand.

Hi,

may be a new feature wish:
ist there an option to have snapping activated for some layers? I don't
mean that while editing the objects snap to layer A but not to layer B.
I mean I have two layers that are in editingmode and while editing layer
A snapping is active but while editing layer B editing is not.

Hi all

Unless there are any objections I would like to go ahead as scheduled
and make the branch for 1.2 at Midnight tonight, South African time (GMT
+2).

After the branching, trunk will be open again for new features etc. The
only commits taking place in the branch should be related to packaging
activities.

Werner this means you will need to get any new translation work into SVN
during the course of today if it is going to make it into the 1.2 release.

I will post a further notice when I have made the branch.

Regards

Agreed - just lets make sure we'll have the translations; it seems we still have
problems: compare
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/GUI_Translation_Progress#QGIS_Stable_Version_Progress
with
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/GUI_Translation_Progress#QGIS_Unstable_Version_Progress
Also, i18n/qt_*.ts is missing for many languages.
Please translator, a last effort :)
Many thanks.

No objections. Let me know if you want help backporting my fixes from 1.2 to 1.0.x.

Hi!
I'm not quite sure if I'm correct but I remember that i talked with Tim 
or jef about these qt_*.ts files
And IIRC they are only there for compatibility issues with some old qt 
version - correct me if I'm wrong but I think with newer Qt Versions 
these files are not needed anyway..

So probably we should consider to put them out of trunk sometimes..

Tim? jef? am I wrong or right?

regards
Werner

Hi All,

Installed Daphnis from osgeo4w... what my eyes can see... no more
one-finger-shortcuts? I liked them :)
I think most users did. Unfortunatelly the new ones doesn't go well on
windows...

It is not two fingers, Borys, it is already three! Ctrl+Shift+something

As a windows user I need to remind you (developers) that combination
Ctrl+Shift is a little bit dangerous cause it changes the keyboard
settings (at least in Poland), so instead of "x" users will get "z"
and might go dizzy. It is all because of diacritics, I must admit. Our
fault. But we really need them :)

I use Mac too, but still adjusting QGIS to one platform shouldn't make
inconvenience to users of other platform.

Before we think of other shortcut combination, having in mind short
release of Daphnis and documentation issues, I would opt for reverting
short shortcuts for now.

Best,
Milena

Message-ID: <04DA676AA276F045B32D0F95783D78449489B0@EX6.d.ethz.ch>

Hi QGIS devs

I'd like to announce the QGIS raster terrain plugin. It calculates slope, exposition, ruggedness and total curvature based on a 3*3 window for each cell of a raster. The plugin keeps attention that only three raster rows are in virtual memory at a time, so it is also possible to process large rasters.
If you like to test the plugin, you find the source on:
http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/raster_terrain_analysis.tgz
Just unzip it in the src/plugins directory and add 'raster_terrain_analysis' as a new subdirectory in src/plugins/CMakeList:

SUBDIRS (copyright_label 
  delimited_text 
  interpolation 
  north_arrow 
  scale_bar
  oracle_raster
  raster_terrain_analysis
  )

Note that the code is not well tested yet, so drop me a mail if a result seems strange or you have other comments / suggestions / code improvements.

I thought that this plugin could ev. go into the upcoming analysis library of QGIS. Btw. are there any objections on merging the branch with the analysis library after the release of 1.2 and using the library for the interpolation and raster terrain plugin? fTools will come later I think as it probably is a lot of work to port the python code to C++...

Regards,
Marco

Yes I think its a great idea to merge it with the analysis branch / make
it part of the analysis lib - I was hoping to work some more on that in
the hackfest too.

Hi All

I havent quite tagged the release yet as I am experiencing a problem
with the win build:

+1 Thanks Marco.
Does it work with any raster source?
It will be interesting to compare the results with analogous modules from GRASS.
All the best.

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

- --- Note to casual readers --- Please do not pre-announce this release -
give the packagers and release team a chance to do their thing so that
people hearing about the release have a fair chance of finding a
package, reading all our press material etc. --- End note ---

Today I have branched QGIS 1.2.0 'Daphnis' for release. It would be
great if you can assist by making packages for your preferred platform.
The branch can be checked out at:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_2_0 qgis-1_2_0

Source tarballs can be obtained from here:

http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.2.0.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.2.0.tar.gz.md5


Please do not commit anything to the release branch except packaging
related tweaks.

If you make a package please be so kind as to send me an email with
details of where I can download the package. Please make sure the
package is wgettable since I do not have the bandwidth to first download
all packages to my home pc and then up again to the download server.

If you are able to make packages for unlisted platforms / distros please
let me know so that we can avoid duplication of effort.

I would like to make the release announcement around the 30th of August,
so it will be great to have as many packages as possible ready by then.

SVN (Trunk) is open again for general commits - please seek guidance
from Marco Hugentobler (PSC Code Manager) if you are planning any major
code changes.


The timeline for our future releases is, as always, available here:

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/roadmap



Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS a reality.

Lastly can I call on the release team to put together visual changelog,
press announcements etc. ready for the release date? I will send you an
email when the packages are ready and you can start broadcasting
announcements.

Best regards

The hackfest would be a good place to get this going again, and I'm 
looking forward to this. Unfortunately my PhD has been getting in the 
way of my QGIS stuff over the past few months, so there has been very 
little new work done lately. As for merging the raster analysis stuff 
with the analysis branch, this sounds fantastic (+1), and will be a very 
good step towards making QGIS a well rounded platform for GIS analysis.

Tim,

sorry, I missed some commits yesterday that needed to be synchronized  
with the Xcode project before you branched.  They're done in the  
branch now.

I'll be doing the framework-based OSX binaries, of course.  I don't  
know if Tom will still do the all-in-one, but I could give it a try  
since I set up the Xcode project to be able to do it, if there is  
interest.

I've updated:

- our qgis-unstable ppa on launchpad for intrepid, jaunty and karmic. gutsy and
  hardy only have GEOS<3,
- the ubuntugis-unstable ppa for hardy, intrepid and jaunty.  ubuntugis has a
  backported GEOS3 for hardy and doesn't carry karmic packages yet and
- uploaded a new qgis-unstable package to OSGeo4W.

I also updated the version numbers in trunk so the OSGeo4W nightly build should
continue to work.

And I commited the three patches that were waiting for this.

I personally use your excellent separate Frameworks William, but being  
able to recommend the all in one installer is an great thing.

Hi Paolo

>Does it work with any raster source?

It should work with every GDAL supported source. Currently it always takes the first band as input (assuming that the terrain rasters are usually single band rasters).

>It will be interesting to compare the results with analogous modules from GRASS.

Yes, slope and aspect can be compared with results from GRASS commands (r.slope.aspect). I tested the slope and found that, for my test area, the results are identical (as they also used Horn's algorithm for derivative estimation). One small difference is that r.slope.aspect fills the border cells with null values while the raster terrain plugin tries to estimate these too.

Performance comparison is surely also interesting. Slope calculation on my test raster (1.6 GB large GeoTiff) took 2min5s with the raster plugin (saved to GeoTiff). The same raster, imported into grass with r.in.gdal, took 3min12s to process with r.slope.aspect. But this is not a systematic evaluation at all, just a single test. It surely depends also on the raster format you use for reading/writing in the plugin.

Regards,
Marco

Does it work with any raster source?
It will be interesting to compare the results with analogous modules from GRASS.

That I don't know, but I would suggest to simply ask Peter Ersts et al
to dual license the documentation as GPLD if needed - I think this is
allowed and most likely they would be agreeable to it.

Hi Tim and QGis dev's.

I just want to ask you if can you add my name (German Carrillo) to the
Contributors list. On last two months I was sending some minor (really
minor) patches in map legend (TOC?), symbology and identify results, please
search 'gcarrillo' on QGis trac.

I don't know if it's too late to appear on Qgis 1.2.

Oh! Also, why the contributors list doesn't appear on the QGis about dialog?
;-)

Thanks by all your effort and congratulations by QGis 1.2!

German

Sorry the release is already done so its too late - your name will be in
 QGIS 1.3

I think we can add this - once again, something for 1.3.

No problem - they wont be in the source tarball though so if you think
that it is important to have them there we should make a second version
of the src.

Yes I think there is a lot of interest in the all-in-one build so if you
can generate one easily that would be great.

Rats, one more change for the Xcode project (r11492).  Good to go now.

When I thought about it, I realized that an all-in-one is (mostly)  
pointless.  Because anyone who needs GRASS support must install GRASS,  
which requires installed frameworks, defeating the convenience of  
bundling of the frameworks in Qgis (GRASS won't see those).

Also, for OSX Tiger, there is still the bug

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1800

which causes Qgis to crash if GRASS is missing, thus effectively  
requiring GRASS (and the installed frameworks) as a workaround until  
the problem is fixed.

So, the only people who would benefit from an all-in-one would be OSX  
Leopard users who don't need GRASS support.

This is beyond my knowledge on how these shortcuts can be set in the  
build environment, but it sounds like there needs to be a system check  
at compile time and different keyboard shortcuts should be set based  
on the OS. I think someone said this was not possible. Is that correct?

The source file where the shortcut defaults are setup can be  
conditionalized on the platform, and some already are, but only to not  
define a shortcut that would conflict with the system (like cmd-H on  
OSX = hide app).

I considered doing that for the bugfix, but then default shortcuts  
wouldn't be consistent across platforms.

I think an all-in-one package should contain GRASS.

I built opensuse packages for 10.3, SLE10, SLE11, 11.0 and 11.1 from the source
tarballs. As usual the packages are (or will soon be) available via the
Application:Geo build server as described on the qgis download webpage.

A note for 10.3 and SLE10 users:

For opensuse 10.3 and SLE10 I updated QT4 to 4.4.3 and python to 2.5. In this
context it was necessary to update a lot of other depending packages as well.
For future QGIS releases I decided to stop building QGIS packages for these
'old' versions, bacause it doesn't really make sense, if you have to update
almost half of your installation to be able to work with QGIS. So, I would
like to ask all 10.3 and SLE10 users to upgrade their installation to something
more current like SLE11 or 11.1.

Regards,
 Otto

Hi all.
I compile QGIS for our internal use on a few architectures (amd64, i386) and for

I will copy our packages here:

You're welcome to use them.

What are the differences between the deb-packages from gfoss.it[1]? if
so, are there any?

btw. the packages are signed with a special key (0FC37F09), but this
key is not signed by anyone. To support the web of trust it would be
good if anyone could sign the key though.

I maintain my packages for internal use; those on debian.gfoss.it are meant for
the public. The main diff, however, is the availability for different platform
(hw & distro).

not practical: huge - right now my universal GRASS app is ~200MB;  
universal Qgis is 160MB; the frameworks total 120MB

It also just seems wrong, bundling a complete application inside  
another application.

I guess personally I'm just not too keen on the all-in-one thing,  
especially with the complications (it would be fine otherwise).

One possibility would be to completely remove the GRASS plugin from  
the all-in-one Qgis.  Then it won't even try to load it and crash.   
The readme would point people to the full framework-based Qgis if they  
need GRASS support.

This seems like a good idea. I'm wondering how useful it is for those  
needing to save bandwidth to have to download an application that is  
200mb (all-in-one with grass)? At 160mb, it's bad enough. That  
includes all the qt-frameworks, correct? So, either way, there is no  
dependency on qt.

That's 200 for GRASS + 160 for QGIS + 120 for frameworks. (that's  
installed sizes, download sizes ~40%)

Ouch! Obviously no advantage for the bandwidth conscious users.

Hello all,

I've been getting this error over the last couple weeks when build qgis from

I'm ready to translate and broadcast the announcement in Italian, if the en
announcement is ready *before* next Friday (otherwise, after Sept 8th, too late
I guess).

Thanks Hamish.
Why don't we share symbols and icons across programs, without having to
duplicate the efforts, and providing more consistency to users?
A sort of gis-desktop icons, see http://tango.freedesktop.org
All the best.

You need define which field you want get by call attributeMap.
...

    id = v_provider.fieldNameIndex( field_name )
    v_provider.select([id]) # Define field you get attribute
    rows = []
    feat = QgsFeature()
    while v_provider.nextFeature( feat ):
      data = feat.attributeMap()[ id ]
      row = [ data ]
      rows.append( row )

...


PS: I made some sources for study case, if you want i can send for you.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] join attributes error
Message-ID: <4A93F990.4050104@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
While joining a df table to a point layer, I get the following error:

Errore durante l'esecuzione di codice Python:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/fTools/tools/doJoinAttributes.py", line
109, in accept
    self.compute(inName, inField, joinName, joinField, outPath, keep, useTable,
self.progressBar)
  File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/fTools/tools/doJoinAttributes.py", line
205, in compute
    if atMap1[index1].toString().trimmed() == i[index2].toString().trimmed():
KeyError: -1

Original data are available if this helps to replicate the error.
Thanks for any hint.
All the best.

This looks like I missed an error check in the join attributes module.
However, it's a bit odd that it's returning a -1. Perhaps you could send me
the original data Paolo?

Cheers,

OSX packages are mostly ready.  I just need to test run on Tiger  
(Leopard tested).

I decided to do the all-in-one builds without GRASS support.  While  
there is no crashing problem on Leopard (https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1800 
), I figured consistency is better between Leopard and Tiger builds.

As always, I'll have them on my site when ready.

Speaking from the organisations where I do some contracting that run
SLED, they are extremely conservative about upgrading to new versions of
SLED. They typically run it on servers with users using remote logins to
get their desktops. Doing such an upgrade especially when they have to
use certified drivers to access hardware systems like storage arrays is
extremely problematic. In my case of course I can just build from source
for them, but I guess in other organisations they will not do that.
However I agree with your statements regarding the high dependency count
and I guess its up to the individual organisations to figure out how
they will support their users over the long term on such distros.

Tim

Hi

Out of curiosity, will new packages be needed for Snow Leopard coming
out in a few days?

Hi Jamie

I havent had similar errors myself, but I'm using ubuntu 9.04. I suggest
submitting a patch to Borys Jurgiel with your fix.

The Leopard build should work on Snow, just as the Tiger build works  
on Leopard.  Apple's pretty good about backwards compatibility for 1  
version in the system libraries.

My main reasons for doing separate packages are:

- extra 64bit architectures in Leopard.  Though at this time it isn't  
an issue for Qgis.  It will be when we can get Qgis working with the  
new Qt Cocoa frameworks, which are 64bit.

- Python - Tiger needs Python 2.5 from python.org, Leopard includes  
Python 2.5 in the system.  This is only because Qgis links the Python  
library directly because it has an embedded interpreter, otherwise it  
would be easy to use either Python 2.5 installation from the same Qgis  
binary.

For Snow Leopard, it should also have a Python 2.5 in the system, so  
we really don't need a 3rd package, even when I can build one.  Though  
since Snow is Intel only, the binary size can be reduced with a  
separate package by leaving out the PPC side.

Hi all and Borys,

just a note, seems like plugins with the same name from different repos are
not duplicated as I guess they should. This is not the time to ring
the bells, but wait till we have hundreds.

For example TestPlugin by Vulcan is overriding my very own with the same name.

Hi,
This file is created during building. Maybe the the problem is that its source 
file (qgsplugininstallerfetchingbase.ui) was saved in newer Designer (AFAIR in 
KDE 4.2 @ Ubu 8.10) than your pyuic4 (which is building it now). I'll think 
about it after the Sunday.

	transparency/opacity
Message-ID: <50033.193.246.86.39.1251271293.squirrel@webmail.carto.net>

Hi QGIS developers,

For QGIS 1.3 (or whatever the successor is called) I would like to discuss
whether we can add group transparency in addition to the regular layer
transparency.

This is a concept available in SVG. The difference is that with group
opacity/transparency, the layers in the group are rendered first
individually (with or without opacity) and then the transparency is added
on the intermediate rendering result of the group as a whole.

The difference is clearly seen if you have layers in a group where
polygons of different layers overlap. You don't want opacity on the
individual layers (since this would change colors), but you want to be
able to set the opacity on the parent group, for being able to have a
background base map shine through.

Here are two links on the topic:
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/masking.html#ObjectAndGroupOpacityProperties
and
http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2009/04/23/layered-rendering-part-2-it-helps-solve-many-problems/

Maybe something to discuss at the Vienna meeting?

Should I file a feature request?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi devs,

The raster terrain plugin is in trunk now (at the moment without analysis lib, 
but I plan to do that soon).

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Raster based terrain analysis with QGIS
Datum: Freitag, 21. August 2009
Von: "Hugentobler Marco" <marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>
An: qgis-developer@lists.osgeo.org

Hi QGIS devs

I'd like to announce the QGIS raster terrain plugin. It calculates slope, 
exposition, ruggedness and total curvature based on a 3*3 window for each cell 
of a raster. The plugin keeps attention that only three raster rows are in 
virtual memory at a time, so it is also possible to process large rasters.
If you like to test the plugin, you find the source on:
http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/raster_terrain_analysis.tgz
Just unzip it in the src/plugins directory and add 'raster_terrain_analysis' 
as a new subdirectory in src/plugins/CMakeList:

SUBDIRS (copyright_label 
  delimited_text 
  interpolation 
  north_arrow 
  scale_bar
  oracle_raster
  raster_terrain_analysis
  )

Note that the code is not well tested yet, so drop me a mail if a result seems 
strange or you have other comments / suggestions / code improvements.

I thought that this plugin could ev. go into the upcoming analysis library of 
QGIS. Btw. are there any objections on merging the branch with the analysis 
library after the release of 1.2 and using the library for the interpolation 
and raster terrain plugin? fTools will come later I think as it probably is a 
lot of work to port the python code to C++...

Regards,
Marco

Hi Andreas

Yes, please fill a feature request.

Additionally, there could be a transparency on classification level where each 
QgsSymbol has its own transparency (OGC SLD style).

Some feature requests has to do with setting default project properties. Implementing that
is probably a good idea.

Could a solution be to create the concept of "default.qgs", an empty project that gets read every time QGIS starts
and every time "New project..." is selected. Everything but the layers(?) will be read from the default.qgs, stored
next to users .qgis db.

A button in project properties for "Save as defaulut setting..." is the UI changes that is needed?

Thoughts?

Carson,

We are happy to change the license as needed. The CC license is mostly a 
holdover from the exercises that were originally written and then 
retooled into the more generic "documentation", and I don't think anyone 
thought too much about the implication of its use. But, let me chat it 
over with the folks who did the exercise and docs.

The link JJL sent is quite handy.

Hi all,

I was submitting a patch recently and was confused, as type:patch is
not on the starting page for submission of the new ticket [1]

1. http://gis-lab.info/images/screenshots/20090826-wjx-28kb.jpg

Apparently it can be set after submission, but I find this confusing.
Now I know how to set it in future, but I hope this can
be fixed for fresh patch committer. Am I missing something?

+1 from me.

Having a default project would solve several problems at once. One could 
have default units, projection, digitizing settings, selection and 
background colors, etc.

One would have to issue a warning though, if the default.qgs is from an 
old QGIS version.

Thanks pete.

Let me know what you guys decide. If it is possible to use your docs, 
this will likely be the best plugin documentation we have! I would like 
to see more plugins with this level of detail... so hopefully it's all A 
OK, and we can use this as a model for future plugin docs...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Flickr account for QGIS screenshots
Message-ID: <1251360588.4759.21.camel@galadriel.uagra.net>

Hi all, and sorry for cross-posting,

I just activated a Flickr account to share QGIS images. Users, manual
contributors and developers are invited to add pics showing QGIS'
features. These pics are primarily intended to appear in visual
changelog, but can of course be used for any other purpose.

The login [0] is
qgispics:quantumgis

A note for eVince plugin users and developers: can someone add a
screenshot showing it in action? Many thanks!

As it's a free account, there is a limit of upload size per month and a
global limit of 200 images. I hope it's not a problem, at least atm. If
needed, it can be upgraded to pro-account for a reasonable price.

best regards,

Anne Ghisla

Message-ID: <4A97B3C4.4040502@gmail.com>

Hi!

After upgrading to qgis 1.2.01~jaunty, qgis does not start.
If I run qgis from a terminal, I get:
/usr/bin/qgis.bin: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libqgisgrass.so.1.2.0: 
undefined symbol: G_no_gisinit

I've tried
~$ sudo apt-get install libqgis
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree      
Reading state information... Done
E: Couldn't find package libqgis

I've reinstalled libqgis1.2.0_1.2.0-1~jaunty1_i386.deb 
<https://launchpad.net/%7Eubuntugis/+archive/ubuntugis-unstable/+files/libqgis1.2.0_1.2.0-1%7Ejaunty1_i386.deb>
from
https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntugis-unstable

but still have the same problem

Is this a problem with the package or am I doing something wrong?
Thanks for any advice

Hi Agus,

I don't know specifically about your errors, but I installed the
latest unstable version from the repositories at:
https://launchpad.net/~qgis/+archive/unstable.  Maybe you want to add
these repositories and see if it works for you.

Are you using qgis 1.2.01 on ubuntu jaunty? Are you using the grass plugin?
If yes, could you check if you have libgdal1-1.5.0-grass and/or 
libgdal1-1.6.0-grass ?
I think that the problem is there because:

1. If I install qgis 1.2.01 having the

http://ppa.launchpad.net/qgis/unstable/ubuntu
as the repository (and not http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu)

I get the same problem as stated in my previous message.

I've realized that the grass plugin installs
libgdal1-1.5.0-grass
despite the fact that I do have
libgdal1-1.6.0-grass

2. If I uninstal the grass plugin but keep both libgdal1-1.*, I can 
start qgis
but get the following messages in the console:

~$ qgis
ERROR 1: libgrass_I.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or 
directory

gdal.py was placed in a namespace, it is now available as osgeo.gdal
  DeprecationWarning)
etc

3. If I remove libgdal1-1.5.0-grass, qgis starts up and I just get the 
following in the console:
/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/osgeo/gdal.py:81: DeprecationWarning: 
gdal.py was placed in a namespace, it is now available as osgeo.gdal
  DeprecationWarning)

The problem is that I do need the grass plugin now. I suspect that 
removing libgdal1-1.6.0-grass
would let me install the grass plugin with no problems, but I'm using 
libgdal1-1.6.0-grass for
ecw support...

Hi Goyo,

qgis-unstable-ubuntugis-jef is just for test builds.  After the builds
succeeded they were copied to unstable-ubuntugis.

So it's virtually impossible that the packages in unstable-ubuntugis work any
different than those from qgis-unstable-ubuntugis-jef. They are the same.

You probably didn't consider that the qgis-unstable-ubuntugis-jef repository
depends on unstable-ubuntugis.   So you need the latter in any case.   And as
it already contains the packages from qgis-unstable-ubuntugis-jef, you don't
need my test repository at all.

But just using qgis-unstable-ubuntugis-jef will probably give you the right
qgis, but some older dependencies from plain ubuntu - looks like that doesn't
work.  But that was never intended anyway.

If you don't want ubuntugis the qgis unstable ppa[1] has packages that work
with plain ubuntu.

J?rgen,

But going back to my original question, and having only

 http://ppa.launchpad.net/qgis/unstable/ubuntu jaunty

as repository, qgis does not start if the grass plugin is installed.
Note that the grass plugin requires 
libgdal1-1.5.0-grass
despite the fact that I do have
libgdal1-1.6.0-grass

Could this be the reason for the crash?
/usr/bin/qgis.bin: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libqgisgrass.so.1.2.0: 
undefined symbol: G_no_gisinit

Should I remove  libgdal1-1.6.0-grass ? The problem is
that I need it for ecw support, don't I? Is  
libgdal1-1.6.0-grass being avoided for the grass plugin because it's still
on ubuntugis-unstable?

Agus

Confirmed:

If qgis 1.2.0.1 (including the grass plugin) is installed from the 
repository indicated in the qgis download page:

 http://ppa.launchpad.net/qgis/unstable/ubuntu jaunty

qgis crashes at startup with:
/usr/bin/qgis.bin: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libqgisgrass.so.1.2.0: 
undefined symbol: G_no_gisinit

Installing using
http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu
as repository works fine.

Also, Synaptic does not list libqgis.* when qgis is used in the Search field
(you must write libqgis to see libqgis* items listed) and
does not select libqgis* for removal when qgis is selected for removal (even complete removal). As a matter of fact, I had both libqgis.1.1.0 and libqgis1.2.0, although this duplicity
does not seem to have been a problem.

Thanks

Agus

Message-ID: <20090831080718.79e6f17b@nature.localdomain>

Hi everyone,

thanks to the effort of Giovanni and Anita the qgis gadget shop is back
again. The available products were designed using the new QGIS logo created
by Anita.

The direct link to the shop is http://qgis.spreadshirt.net/

and it is also integrated into the top menu of the qgis website and in the
community area.

http://www.qgis.org/de/qgis-shop.html

Spreadshirt has been chosen because it has a good feedback as service
(quality, shipping, return, etc.) but if you will have any problem please let
us know.

Happy qgis shopping!

 Giovanni, Anita and Otto

Message-ID: <4A9B7125.2030300@linfiniti.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all

There will be a small delay in the release announcement - I expect to
announce in the next day or two.

After a lot of poking around this weekend, I have decided to make the
win standalone installer a non-grass build since I cannot get the GRASS
included with it to run reliably. Obviously this will dissapoint GRASS
users, so I am appealing to anyone who knows windows better than I do
(pretty much everyone I guess :-P ) for help to make GRASS work. What is
needed? I need someone to fix the batch file launcher script I wrote so
that QGIS does not crash when trying to create a new mapset with a
projection specified. It crashes in other situations too.

The other alternative is to suggest that grass users use the osgeo4w
installer for now.

It would be great if folks could test the non-grass installer that I
have put online here:

http://linfiniti.com/downloads/QGIS-1.2.0-0-No-GrassSetup.exe

Please note that in line with previous discussions on the dev list, I
have removed all mention of the word 'unstable' from the package, and
QGIS will now by default install into a fresh directory "C:\Program
Files\Quantum GIS Daphnis" and therefore wont overwrite previous version
anymore either.


Release team: Thanks for jumping in to help. Everything set with the
vis. changelog? Please ask on the dev mailing list if you still have
screenies missing.

Regards

The installer and Daphnis itself works fine on win xp
(tested old projects, vectors .shp, .tab and some fTools on them -
nothing unexpected happened for 3h)

Thanks for the feedback Milena! I had one report of a crash when opening ecw images which I will look into tonight.

Carson,

We uploaded a newer version of the documentation with a clarification on 
the license -- as the license text actually talked about the "exercise" 
not the "documentation".  It has always been intended to be as free and 
open to use as possible.

http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/evis/documentation.php

We used DocBook, so that we could quickly and easily build pdfs and html 
from the same source xml. If you are interested in the base xml file, 
let us know.
