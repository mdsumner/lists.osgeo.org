And that it didn't exists in GEOS <3.2 (hence the Lucid build broke last
night).

Sounds reasonable. Could you please open a ticket?

Hi J?rgen

>And that it didn't exists in GEOS<3.2


Oh, true. So I'm going to use GEOSOffsetCurve and disable the tool if 
compiled against geos <3.3 (3.2. does not throw an exception in case of 
numerical problems).

Regards,
Marco

Because it contains small gaps between lines and points

Hi everyone,

I would like to remove feature in a vector layer, but the
deleteFeatures do not seems to work.

Is it a bug ? How can I do this ?

How should I handle features ids ?

Thanks.

Hi all,
I don't know if this has been already suggested/asked before, and I don't
know if it's already available somehow.
I feel there is a hole between Layer Actions and Plugins, which various
softwares fill with Macros (like OO StarBasic, Mapinfo's MapBasic, etc.).
It would be nice to be able to write Macros, like in Actions, but on a
application level and not bounded to a layer.
The plus would be to let the user assign Macros to custom menu items...
The last step would be being able to call plugin methods.

Ok, one step at a time :)
First question: have I missed this option, is it already available?
Second question: what do you think about it?

Hi giovanni,

Can you give me a use case for these Marcos? I have used MapBasic before
but that is more like what QGIS provides via Python, although MapBasic can
be a bit easier to learn due to it being a DSL[1]

Hi Nathan,
I don't mean using some derived BASIC language. The Macros should be the
same as Action types (generic, python, etc.). The only difference being not
bounded to layers, but available in a menu list.
The menu could be a fixed Actions menu for the moment. In the future it
could be a customizable option...

            The current layer.
        Returns:
            The converted bbox.
        Raises:

        myX2 = theClickBox.xMaximum()
        myY2 = theClickBox.yMaximum()
        myPoint2 = myMapToPixel.toMapCoordinates(myX2, myY2)

        print myFeature
        myMessage = ('Returned object was not a feature.')

However, the coordinates are not in the right place when they are returned
in the layer CRS. They're supposed to hit the feature I'm trying to select,
but they don't.

The coordinates that get returned (same as those in the test) are way off
base, and it shouldn't be possible to click there if the canvas is zoomed
to the layer extents (there are no other features in the test layer).

So my theory is that the coordinates are transformed incorrectly. What am I
doing wrong?

I see what you mean.  What would you do with these global actions?

Just trying to get an idea of what is needed/missing currently.

Hi,

Did you try deleteFeatures from dataProvider or deleteFeature from 
vectorLayer ?

This is strange, I have successfully use the deleteFeatures from the 
dataProvider

here at line 103
https://github.com/3nids/Triangulation/blob/2b90973a34f835ac3564204dcbccc573bcff274a/triangulation.py


same for addFeatures.

Which version of Qgis are you using?

The same you can do with plugins... but in an easier way :)

Two use cases:

1) Let the user do data management on layers. E.g. load layers, apply
symbologies, etc.
These operations are not bounded to a specific layer. They should be
available as "Global Actions".

2) Let's suppose I create a plugin with some utility functions, e.g. to do
analysis, data management, etc.
I would like to give the end-user the opportunity to use them, but without
the need to create a plugin (it's still too difficult for the end-user).

No idea what is the problem.

I don't have 1.7 installed, you could try installing the dev version 
(1.9.90) with the osgeo4w installer. Maybe something changed. I 
experienced a few problems with addFeatures that have been fixed in the 
master.

Otherwise, someone else has to confirm it is ok in 1.7.

Sorry

Denis

The actual implementation is in classes derived from
QgsVectorDataProvider. Each data provider that allows adding/deleting
features has its own logic.

Using data providers directly for adding/deleting features should
work. If it does not, please check return values from the functions
and provider's result from errors() method. It is also possible that
the provider you are using does not support adding/deleting - check
its capabilities first.

Using QgsVectorLayer's add/delete features functionality requires you
to first start editing, then do editing calls and finally commit the
changes. Vector layer has a buffer that records the changes and allows
you to do undo/redo or rollback all changes. When committing the
changes the actual add/delete functions from provider are called that
permanently modify the data.

Wait! We have not been using SVN for quite some time! We are on git now:

Are there plans for a 1.7.5 release? If so, it would be great to have
another table for 1.7.5 added to [1] and we can start collecting potential
backports.

Ok... I'm using the memory data provider (I'm creating my layer as
this: layer = core.QgsVectorLayer(uri, name, "memory") )

I check his capabilities as this:
            self._layer.startEditing()
            dp = self._layer.dataProvider()

            attr = ['NoCapabilities', 'AddFeatures',
             'DeleteFeatures', 'ChangeAttributeValues',
             'AddAttributes', 'DeleteAttributes',
             'SaveAsShapefile', 'CreateSpatialIndex',
             'SelectAtId', 'ChangeGeometries',
             'SelectGeometryAtId', 'RandomSelectGeometryAtId',
             'SequentialSelectGeometryAtId', 'CreateAttributeIndex',
             'SetEncoding']
            cap = dp.capabilities()
            for at in attr:
                logger.debug("capabilities: %s is %s",
                             at,
                             bool(cap & getattr(dp, at))
                             if hasattr(dp, at) else False)

Here is what I have in my log:
	capabilities: NoCapabilities is False
	capabilities: AddFeatures is True
	capabilities: DeleteFeatures is True
	capabilities: ChangeAttributeValues is True
	capabilities: AddAttributes is True
	capabilities: DeleteAttributes is True
	capabilities: SaveAsShapefile is False
	capabilities: CreateSpatialIndex is True
	capabilities: SelectAtId is True
	capabilities: ChangeGeometries is True
	capabilities: SelectGeometryAtId is True
	capabilities: RandomSelectGeometryAtId is False
	capabilities: SequentialSelectGeometryAtId is False
	capabilities: CreateAttributeIndex is False
	capabilities: SetEncoding is False

So I try do delete features as this:
            f = core.QgsFeature()
            fids = []
            while dp.nextFeature(f):
                fids.append(f.id())
            logger.debug("deleting feature: %s", fids)
            if not dp.deleteFeatures(fids):
                # handle error
                for e in dp.errors():
                    logger.critical(e)

What I have in my log:
	deleting feature: []
...but I have features in my layer (!)

Ha is that so ?

Please file a ticket. Should be easy to fix: pre-process the edited
data before sending to the DB.

In this case an ST_Multi would have done.
Triggering condition: input table was strongly-typed Multi*

It looks like you have forgotten to tell which features you want from
the provider - use select() method to specify that. (Because the
"fids" list is empty)

As I'm still using 1.7.4 I've to say that an annoying "bug" I keep hitting
is the slowdown when using labels. I belive it was "fixed" in master by
clipping the lines to the viewport before starting the labeling machine.

I'm still not sure it's safe backporting, but that's pretty much the
biggest issue I face on normal use.

Are there plans for 1.8, btw ?

I know I'm boring, but backporting requires some manpower we have difficulties
allocating now. Please consider helping directly with it, or sponsoring it.
I agree, it would be really good. We just discovered the road graph plugin is
non-functional, for instance.
All the best.

Hello all,

today I have edited the OSGeo application proposal on the wiki [0],
further comments and edits are welcome.

I also invite the projects to uncomment the link to their Ideas
pages in the main OSGeo Ideas page [1], as soon as they are updated to
2012. So, I hope to hear from GDAL, uDig, OpenJUMP, OSSIM, Mapnik,
gvSIG, GeoServer and PostGIS soon! Please forward this message to the
relevant mailing lists.

I also welcome GeoKettle, Opticks and MapWindow to chime in whether
they wish to participate under OSGeo umbrella.

All the best,
Anne

Hi all.
I find ohloh rather interesting: http://www.ohloh.net/p/3663
Unfortunately, our code history was wiped out during the move from svn to git.
I think this is a pity - decision makers use it, and I think proper stats will help
us a little bit.
Does anybody know how to add back the svn history?
All the best.

I agree, I certainly used these stats in many many many presentations over the 
past 5 years to show how vibrant the project is :)
My favourite stat is to show how many committers there were in last 12 months,
it's always encouraging.

You should be able to have both repositories listed on ohloh, I think I did it
with other sites before.  Only git was enlisted.  I assume someone removed
the SVN enlistment for a reason, but I just added it back in.  Feel free to remove
it if I shouldn't have added it, but I think it should give you back the history without
too much grief with overlaps.  Will take a while to show up.

Our git repository contains the whole project history including the
period of usage of SVN. So it may be just necessary to regenerate the
statistics completely?

Most of the history looks good now that both the git and svn repos are
listed, although I would think you really only need the git one since it
contains the whole history.

I really like this view

Unfortunately adding the SVN repo has doubled the commit counts for all developers.

Hi

One more question:
The script fails to export larger images (round about 12,000 x 30,000).
Either the image.save() function returns "False" or the written image is
empty.
I read, that QImage() has a sizelimitation of 32,768 x 32,768 pixel. But
this should not be the problem here, right?
Are there limitation for the QgsMapRenderer? Or is this a memory issue?
I tested on a laptop computer with 1GB RAM (with Ubuntu 11.04) and a Windows
machine with 4 GB RAM. Both with the result desrcribed above...

Any ideas?

Thanks for helping.

Cheers
Stefan

Hi Stefan

I suppose it is a memory problem. Could you try on a Linux machine with 
4GB? The windows binaries are normally 32bit, so afaik the memory 
limited to 2GB.

Marco

Hi,

my steps are:

Any wrong step?

Dear everyone,

Here's another one of my field reports on the QGIS training we are
conducting here.

This time, we are providing GIS courses to Masters students.  I
believe this is one of the few masters program here in the Philippines
that is providing exclusively open source GIS course.  The students
are mostly local government personnel in remote towns.

First run of the course for basics of GIS was conducted last week.
Everything went very well and even those who have prior experience to
using proprietary GIS are impressed with the ease-of-use and
functionality of QGIS.

It is customary for me to document the experience of the students and
report them to QGIS in this list.  No crash this time just minor bugs.

Below are the filed tickets (bugs and enhancement):

 * Query failed if field value contains apostrophe
-http://hub.qgis.org/issues/2766
 * qgis install not completed when vcredist 2005 is running -
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5111
 * Allow acquiring legend symbols from WMS (if available) using
GetLegendGraphic spec - http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5112

Hi all,

Any objections for removing the old labelling stuff?

Is there anything the old one can do the new one can't?

I'm finding users are getting confused that there are two
different labelling engines and this is bad for user experience.  Also
makes training hard as you have to tell people to ignore that part of the
program when labelling is something everyone wants to do.

If all +1s to the above.

Should we make this change in upcoming 1.8?

Nathan,

thanks for the move. Two labelling eninges is impossible to explain to 
users. One thing, though: The old engine allows for setting a rotation 
independent from also setting an x and y field.

Please Aldo note that the new labelling is very slow, and has a number of bugs to be fixed before removing the old one.
Thanks.

There've been a temporary API break in PostGIS during 2.0 closeup
(RASTER ~ GEOMETRY operator).

Should be fixed in PostGIS-2.0.0beta2SVN (beta2 package should be
available on Wednesday)

Hi,

I have some students which would like to work on "Add and "R Free"
geostatistic toolbox using HPGL" (see [1]) within their semester
project (CTU in Prague). Is this topic still interesting for QGIS
users, or better to say what's status of this idea?

Thanks, Martin

there is no "status", once I found the HPGL library I just left the
suggestion that it was a good idea for a QGIS toolbox.


cheers!

the only "excuse" I find is that is for backward compatibility with

I agree, from a user point of view the data defined label rotation (and
placement), as it is now, it is not usable.

I'd suggest to keep the labeling until 2.0.. with this version number
people expect things to be changed..
Of course we can discuss to remove old labeling in 1.8 but IMHO this is not
a good idea (keep things with major version numbers the same things).
A thing to discuss in lyon? With some other things to discuss ...
Kind regards

I'd say the new labeling should also be integrated into the vector layer
properties (not sure if there is something implementationwise that is an
obstacle to that).   In that case we also could have a switch mechanism like
between old and new labeling.

I'd support this idea. This would help remove the confusion, or at least
hide it, until we can remove it in 2.0.  We could do what we did with the
symbologly and set it to you use new labelling by default.
I don't mind having the toolbar button but we could change it to
just launch the properties -> Labels tab.

 Hi,

 We discussed this issue backwards and forwards and it would be good to 
 make some progress here. There is really not a lot missing in the new 
 labeling and I don't agree with Paolo that the new labeling is slower 
 than the old labeling. It may have different settings and thus people 
 are comparing apples with oranges.

 It would be good to integrate the labeling 2.0 in the layers dialogue 
 and make it the default.

 If someone is missing a feature in labeling 2.0 that is present in 
 labeling 1.0 he/she should either work on it or pay someone to work on 
 it. It is not good blocking labeling 2.0 just because some minor aspect 
 is missing.

 What are the real issues/problems with labeling 2.0?

 Andreas

One more issue is that labels from new labeling engine are not preserved as
text in SVG output (at least last time i checked).

Best wishes,

Please test it with an old PC, ora netbooK: in our case it is almost 
unusable with <300 polygons.
Also, some of the bugs are pretty serious.
All the best.

Any way to find the bottleneck?
It would be real nice to have the new labeling replacing the old one.
Redundancy is nice.. but not forever.
:)
I wish i could find the bottleneck myself..

Try it with many (>500) polygon shapes. It takes ages on a dual core.

 Hi,

 Please be more concrete - there are almost 100 different settings and 
 combinations. What is the problem very precise/concrete.

 What settings did you use, what geometry type - maybe accompanied with 
 screenshots of your settings.

 In my experience the new labeling works very well and fast. Only area 
 geometries are slow to label. Martin Dobias is currently working on 
 improving/accelerating the labeling of area geometries.

 So - as I understand it - only area features are labeled slowly while 
 the speed of point and line labeling is fast enough, correct?

 If this is the issue I can tell you that Martin Dobias is currently 
 working on improving the speed of area feature labeling. So improvements 
 in this respect should appear soon.

Hi all

It would be good to have the choice between new and old engine, similar 
as in the symbology tab, with the new one set as default (as many people 
on the list suggest). With 2.0, the old engine could be removed. Maybe 
some of the missing features will be there then. And if not, there is 
still the possibility to consider some sort of old labelling 
compatibility mode (one candidate position at the centerpoint of a feature).

Regards,
Marco

 Hi J?rgen,

 Do you know in which directories I need to place the libeay32.dll? 
 Would it be the directory where the qgis.exe file resides - e.g. 
 C:\Program Files\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-dev\bin ?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

I cannot confirm slow polygon labelling
~42000 parcels (polygon) stored in a PostGIS DB (remote)
each labelled with its parcel number over centroid between scales 1:1: - 
1:4000
labels instantly on
1) an Intel Core2 Duo 2.2GHz 2GB RAM runnning WinXP/QGIS 1.7.1
2) an Intel QuadCore 2.80 GHz 4GB RAM running OpenSuse 64bit/QGIS 1.7.4

It seems it is still slower the the old labelling even with points.  Using
the default settings for _new_ labelling I get this debug output.  Using
settings

Only a small sample set but there is a speed difference.  The main thing
seems to be the painting which is slowing it down.

That's one candidate, apps\qgis\bin is another.  There might also be gdal
plugins or python extensions that need it.

Hello,

First, sorry for my english
Second : 
I've upgraded the python plugin made by Mr Jurgiel "Profile", witch is now able to work with polyline, with on the fly projection of raster, and with multi-band raster. I'm "amateur" developer, and i think i'm quite representative of people who don't know so much about development, but want humbly to contribute ...
I wanted to join Mr Jurgiel to see if there's a place (like git..) where i can find and modify the source. but i found nothing.
Then, readinq qgis web pages, i learned that there is the site "http://plugins.qgis.org/" where plugin can be shared. I registered and shared the plugin. 
also, i decided to create a project under http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins, as recommended

So, i've got some questions and remarks :
- If Mr Jurgiel see my post, does he let me the right to share the plugin, whitch is under GNU LGPL ? (Do i need his agreement? - there's a copyright with his name on the top of .py code, what does it involve ?)
- How do i know that the plugin is validated on http://plugins.qgis.org/ ? And if he's not, how do i know why ?
?I think that de validation procedure is quite complicated, everybody should put a plugin on http://plugins.qgis.org/. Maybe enabling comments about the plugin on this page should be a good way to :
? ?? -know if the plugin is good or not, 
? ?? -simply have remarks about the plugin, without opening the tracker procedures. That is simplier for lot of people.
-Then, creating a project on http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins, i didn't succeed in creating project within the qgis-user-plugins projet. is it normal ? I 've read that the admin of the site is moving plugin ? Also, how enabling maximum of people to contribute on this plugin ?

To conclude, i'm not a pro, but i have good intentions. if the basic procedure is explained on http://plugins.qgis.org/, some points are not explained, and amateur like me could be quite lost :
how do i know if the plugin shared is validated ? how long does it take ? and if not validated, why ?
how do i create a project within qgis-user-plugins project ?

thank you for your attention and? your answers,
Patrice, France

Thanks J?rgen.

Everything works fine by copying the libeay32.dll into apps\qgis-dev\bin\

I also found out what other software caused the conflict. It is Abacus - the accounting software our city id using.

Thanks again Andreas.

Do you know in which directories I need to place the libeay32.dll? 
Would it be the directory where the qgis.exe file resides - e.g.

Thanks,

Hi

At the moment I am also working on upgrading a python plugin (Colour 
scale bar by bc-consult). Only a little testing is left and no changes 
to the user interface are made. Now the plugin should support linear 
interpolation (interpolates to ~200 color values if there are less than 
100 colors specified) and treat exact styles like discrete styles 
without interpolation.

The question is: should i make a new Plugin-Project or is there a way to 
update the old one for me. Or is it better to send the code to one which 
updates the plugin?

best whishes
thomas

Yes, this is the way GPL works, you can create a new work based on
another work released under GPL , provided that your work is also
released as GPL.


(Do i need his agreement? - there's a copyright
> with his name on the top of .py code, what does it involve ?)

you should just leave copyright notice and add yours listing your modifications.

> - How do i know that the plugin is validated on http://plugins.qgis.org/ ?

The validation is really basic and automatic, it's a software
procedure which controls that the plugin has required metadata.

> And if he's not, how do i know why ?

You maybe are talking about plugin approval. Currently a lot of people
can approve plugins, usually the approval is very fast but there are
no clear responsibilities between developers so it might happen that
your plugin passes under silence, if this  is the case, please
complain (loud) on this list.

> ?I think that de validation procedure is quite complicated, everybody should
> put a plugin on http://plugins.qgis.org/.

You are not the first to complain but I thing that clicking on "Share
a plugin" and upload a single file (no other actions are required) is
not really complicated.
Of course you must be a registered user, for security reasons we
cannot accept anonymous uploads.

> Maybe enabling comments about the
> plugin on this page should be a good way to :
> ? ?? -know if the plugin is good or not,
> ? ?? -simply have remarks about the plugin, without opening the tracker

This is in the pipeline... feel free to implement it if you can, but
keep in mind that most developers do not read comments but read the
bug trackers.

I would say yes.

I cannot answer about the other questions, sorry.

Best Regards.

Of course you don't need any permission, as long as you follow the GPL 
license. The copyright clause could be applicable e.g. for releasing under 
other license (what would be difficult, as it uses GPL-based QGIS API). 
Btw., it's GPL, not LGPL.

Everybody can put a plugin, then one of moderators looks if there is nothing 
malicious and acept it. What is complicated in it? :)

You can start by emailing the original author. If you don't get a 
satisfactory response follow the same procedure as the previous person 
and upload your plugin to http://plugins.qgis.org/ and possibly create a 
project for it on http://hub.qgis.org

There are a few questions I'm not sure about:
Should the name be changed so both plugins can exist side by side?
How long should one wait before circumventing the original author if 
they don't respond?

Thanks,
Alex

AFAICT, speed depends a lot on the complexity of shapes (for polygons).
Please note however that the behaviour for lines, curved labels, is not 
optimal (see the relevant ticket).

BTW, the same situation, possibly worse, is for diagrams: we now have 
two tabs, side by side, doing largely different things.
It would be very good to clean this up.
All the best, and thanks.

I think this would be very confusing for users, and should be avoided if 
possible.
The best option is always collaborating, and avoid forking a project. 
This should be done IMHO only if the original author is completely 
unresponsive (in this case, the plugin i s a good candidate for 
deprecation).
> How long should one wait before circumventing the original author if

It would be good to have a general rule: 2 weeks?

All the best, and thanks.

+1 for that

Boris, could you please review the changes and then merge them into 
your plugin ? For me it would be better to update one plugin than adding 
a new one to our internal qgis' package and explain the difference to 
the users.

Thank you for your answers !

One first thing : i'm fan of qgis and now it's quite ok to use it for my job. I know it's simple to criticize something, but it's difficult to do the job. Unfortunatly, i don't know how making the work i'm talking about...

Borys : I've uploaded the plugin in http://hub.qgis.org and made you and me admin of the plugin. the first commit is your original plugin. Is it ok for you ? I did it like that because i want to continue working on it ...

Then, i was talking about the plugin approuval and not about validation.... sorry. Maybe indicating in http://plugins.qgis.org/ something like
"Go to Qgis plugin repo and click on Share a plugin. The approuval procedure takes 2 weeks maximum. If not approuved, a e-mail will be sent to you." should be a good thing...

Then, when writing "Register your plugin at http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins. The user plugin section on hub can?show plugin info, let users add issues/tickets for your plugin and to have just ONE repository for all qgis plugins", actually it's not possible. Project can only be created in http://hub.qgis.org/projects/. So is it possible to enable creating project in ..../qgis-user-plugins or just say "Register your plugin at http://hub.qgis.org/projects/ ...." ? 

thanks,
patrice

Hi,

In the QgsRubberBand.addGeometry , we can specify a 0 pointer for the 
layer if we don't need its the coord transformation.

How can I do this in python?

I tried
self.rubber.addGeometry( geom , 0 )

but, of course I got an "unexpected type" error... How can I express a 0 
pointer in python?

Thanks,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Undo/Redo when adding/changing features from Python
Message-ID: <4F572CF9.50403@jena.de>

Dear list,

I am currently doing a Python plugin that adds/changes features in an 
editable QgsVectorLayer:

<code>
# case 1 change
myLayer.changeGeometry(myFid, newGeometry)
# case 2 add
if self.iface.openFeatureForm(myLayer, newFeature):
   myLayer.addFeature(newFeature)
</code>

The Undo/Redo Window does not list anything to undo in case 1 (change) 
and only the attributes changed if I accept the featureForm in case 2.
I would expect "Feature changed" in case 1 and "Feature added" in case 
2. If I digitize a feature the feature form pops up as soon I have 
finished digitizing and accepting it gives me a "Feature added"-undo option.
I found the QgsUndoCommand class in the docs but get a
NameError: name 'QgsUndoCommand' is not defined

any help appreciated

Bernhard

Hi Bernhard

Use QgsVectorLayer::beginEditCommand before adding the feature, then 
endEditCommand or destroyEditCommand after.

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] grass plugin: new password option?
Message-ID: <4F574E8D.9060003@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Recently in the interface of the following modules:
v.in.ogr.qgis
v.in.ogr.qgis.loc
r.in.gdal.qgis
r.in.gdal.qgis.loc
a new option, grayed out (Password) has appeared.
The only difference I see is:
< <file key="input" /> [no password]
---
 > <gdal key="input" /> [password]
so it could be due to a change in gdal/ogr (I have 1.9 here).
Anybody has a hint on what can be happened, and how to fix it?
Thanks a lot.

Coincidence.  Use it on a postgres connection without password and the option
is there (ie. not grayed out; fix for #4259).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin developers: PyQwt alternative needed
Message-ID: <7918D309-D897-4F26-94AF-6EC1B906A90E@kyngchaos.com>

I finally had to remove PyQwt from the Mac QGIS distribution because it crashes QGIS when loading plugins that use it.  PyQwt is not compatible with the latest PyQt 4.9.  PyQt 4.9 is needed for Qt 4.8 compatibility, and Qt 4.8 is needed to support OS X 10.7, so there's no going back.

As far as I can tell, PyQwt development is at least stalled, if not dead.  There is a v5.2.1 in SVN that was never packaged for release, and the last code update was almost 2 years ago.  The developer has stated there are no plans to support Qwt 6.

Plugins that use PyQwt need to find an alternative to provide the functionality they need.  I don't know much about what's out there, but Matplotlib is an option.  Though maybe some integration with Qt is needed.


Note: the Qwt library works fine with the latest Qt, for use by compiled parts of QGIS.

Hi!

I just want to think public about this "forking" plugins problem:

IMHO if the "old" functionality is preserved and the plugin is
extended and has the same functionality plus a little (a lot) more..
than it would be good to contact the maintainer and collaborate with him..

If the old functionality is gone and it is a pretty much new plugin
I'd vote to create a new plugin and give credits to the "inspirator"
of the former plugin with "based on the plugin xyz created by" ..

just my 2?

kind regards
Werner

As I can see PySide is alternative to PyQt not for Qtw/PyQwt.

Right, I do not think I proposed it as an alternative to qwt.

Hi!

Sorry that i mixed up something - I only remebered that we already had
such a discussion about replacing Py(whatever) bindings ..
Don't know when - I only remembered PySide - but PySide seems to have
Qwt bindings too .. so probably it's still a solution?

kind regards

I cannot access the login page to update one of my plugins: error 404.

And, I cannot upload the plugins to the new repo without changing all

But surely if the new plugin still uses any code from the old plugin it will need to retain its copyright notices and license.  Credit for "inspiration" won't be enough.

Surely you are right - if it's more than "inspiration" .. :) copyright
on code still persists.
Sorry if I was misunderstood..

The plugin has not homepage nor project page and is listed on the old

How does one submit bugs for these plugins, and how does one get them updated?

Here is a small patch that fixes the problem

Here is the error in 1.7.4 ( I get roughly the same in master)

I suppose the RGB composition plug-in should be considered as 
depreciated. GdalTools plug-in must be used instead 
(Raster/Miscellaneous/Build Viirtual Raster). The result is the same but 
with more options.

Best regards,

hi!
It seems that 1.8 will overrule the 1.7 branch ..
As 1.8 prepares the way for 2.0 and has much more features than 1.7
and it seems that 1.8 will be here in about a month (and will also
stay a lot longer than 1.7) it seems better to concentrate on
releasing 1.8 (I know there are still bugs in 1.7) ..
As Paolo already said we lack in manpower to prepare 3 different
branches (1.7, 1.8 and master).
So please wait a little more for the Lyon HF - it seems that 1.8 is on
its way ..

After 1.8 release we will collect (and hopefully clean the bugtracker)
new backport bugs for 1.8

kind regards
Werner

As the number (and age) of plugins increases, these issues will be more and more
common, and risk to confuse users, disincentivate bug reporters, and possibly also
bug fixers.
Anyone has a suggestion?
All the best.

Done, thanks.
I think it would be better if we would stay mostly in the same place, possibly close
to the venue. Could you please suggest us the best solution?
Thanks.

I agree that the gdaltools "buils virtual raster" has more options,
but the rgb composition plugin is nicer because you can select
existing layers instead of have to open the input files.  Perhaps this
could be added to gdaltools?

Would it make sense to have a single plugin project (in
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins/) for all plugins which
have no project (yet)?  This would allow for a central place and
unique interface to file bugs, patches and upload files. After some
time the plugin maintainer could create a dedicated project for the
plugin.

Would it make sense marking the master branch as 1.8 instead of having
to backport many things?

master branch contains changes that break API, hence why we have to back
port to 1.8 even though it's not out yet.

No because master is already far beyond the existing 1.8 branch and 
breaks the 1.x API

Subject: [Qgis-developer] featureAdded SIGNAL not being emitted in 1.9.90 ?
Message-ID: <006801ccfd31$5334b610$f99e2230$@lutraconsulting.co.uk>

Hi All,

 

I'm writing a plugin (python) for the latest QGIS stable and wanted to make
use of QgsVectorLayer's geometryChanged signal which I noticed says 'added
in 1.9' or similar in the code.  

 

My plugin already makes use of the featureAdded signal in 1.7.4 which works
fine.  

 

I installed 1.9.90 (yesterday) through the OSGeo4W installer, tried to
connect to the geometryChanged signal but noticed instead that featureAdded
no longer works.  It seems that this signal is no longer emitted in the
trunk version.  

 

Ideally I'd like to be able to use the featureAdded, featureDeleted and
geometryChanged signals.  

 

Can anyone shed any light on why featureAdded has stopped working?

 

Looking forward to hearing your comments.   

 

Kind regards,

Pete

OK got it.

Is there a central place we can request for back-porting of specific
features/bugfixes to 1.8 ?

Etienne

What kind of stuff did you have in mind.  Most things in master, minus a
hand full, will be backported to 1.8

OK, I guess that most (all) people that use master are capable of
doing this (as I am), but how about those who cannot develop QGis or
do not have the time to do so?

I guess I am asking if we could have a central bug entry/wiki page for
users to write their backport requests.

For example, It would be great to have the browser dock (and recent
bugfixes) in 1.8.

Thanks,
Etienne

Bug reports are the place to go for such a thing, no need to create a

Hi all.
I'm getting:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/paolo/.qgis/python/plugins/raster_transparency/rastertransparency.py",
line 167, in layerChanged
    self.dockWidget.updateSliders( maxValue, minValue )

TypeError: QSpinBox.setMinimum(int): argument 1 has unexpected type 'long'

This may be due to a WMS layer.
All the best.

I also experienced problems with new labelling for polygons.
Even when you set new labelling to try only one position, and stay on
centroid, labels still move when you pan. They kind of stay on the
centroid of the *visible* part of the area.
It is annoying when generating tiles with qgis server: you can get
duplicated or cut labels.
Users have difficulty with this and sometimes the only option is the old
labelling.

(Cannot find back that wonderful post of a frequent qgis blogger who
faced the issue and went back to UMN Mapserver. SUre s/he is reading
this)
Other example:
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/QGIS-Server-street-names-in-tiles-td4540846.html


Blind guess: Maybe the fact that it recalculates centroid of partial
polygons at each refresh can cast some light on the performance issue?

Hi,

Apple released Apple Tile Map together with new iPad (HD).

http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/03/08/welcome-apple/

Sites you can view Apple Tile Map:

Using GoogleMap API
http://www.refnum.com/tmp/apple.html

Using Leaflet with transparency
http://ivan.sanchezortega.es/leaflet-apple.php

Can update QGIS OpenLayers Plugin to include Apple Tile Map?

Thanks.

	filedialog
Message-ID: <CAA6k8-+6KVFEd4vGo_COr2h+o=ZhjDbmdBdcVnHxZCZ=7HUbug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

yesterday night I pushed to master the support to SLD.
The feature is available from the Save style/Load style buttons in vector
layer properties.

BTW, there's a problem [1]: you need to add ".sld" extension to the
output filename when saving because there's no way to distinguish what
format was selected in the native file dialog (see [2]).

I remember this was a QT issue (right?) using the
QFileDialog::getSaveFileName static method and this problem was already
handled in more than a place using 2 different solutions:

- adding a combo to select the format before selecting the filename (e.g.
"Save as..."),
- using the non-native filedialog (e.g. "Save image...")

Of course I cannot add the format combo to the Vector layer property GUI
(where should I put it?), but I would avoid the second solution because
there are some tickets about using the non-native filedialogs (see [3], [4]).

Does anybody here know a better solution?
Otherwise I'm going to switch that filedialog to the non-native one.

Regards.

Can you use:

or

void QFileDialog::filterSelected ( const QString & filter ) [signal]

yes I know, those methods are for QFileDialog objects.
If I remember well, creating a QFileDialog instance results in a
non-native filedialog.

I'm talking about the static method and of course I have no QFileDialog
instance I can call those methods on.

NB: the static method should return the selected filter as well using a
in/out parameter (QString *selectedFilter = 0), but the problem is due
to a bug and I don't know if it was fixed and in which QT version.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How do I pass Errors from WFS server to QGIS?
Message-ID: <CAOvGnNwNDpwkpS=UXvPmoMYgFMscjipMSD9A44VbjCnyUtVabw@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

We have a proprietary WFS implementation (a customized solution of
GeoServer) to which our QGIS installation interfaces with.

We need a way to Sanity check the WFS request getting sent on the Wire
based on the user input(an add polygon, for example). We would like to
detect errors (user typo for example) so that QGIS can flag these errors to
the user. We are evaluating a couple of options:

1. Add a custom plugin to the QGIS layer itself. This way, we Sanity Check
the Request before it gets sent.

2. Sanity Check at the server lever. This way, we do not have to worry
about any custom code to QGIS that we will have to carry forward on an
upgrade.

Questions:
If we go with 1, how can we make it as less painful as possible?
If we go with 2, how do we pass error messages from GeoServer back to QGIS
(for eg, throwing WFSException will work?)



Are there any custom plugins available to

 Hi Mayeul,

 I find it useful that clipped features at the edge of the map always 
 get labeled. I actually demanded such a feature from labeling 2.0

 If you want to generate fixed tiles I  think the way to go is by 
 clipping a much larger area and then clip out the center. Proxies, such 
 as  mapproxy can generate these tiles. That way you get good performance 
 and the advanced labeling of QGIS.

 If you want fixed labels in QGIS you can generate the centroids by some 
 tool (e.g. Postgis SQL) and set the x and y columns. That way you get 
 guaranteed fixed labels.

 But I am not a tiling expert - so I may be wrong.

	OTF reprojection
Message-ID: <4F59D7CB.70509@gmail.com>

Hi,
It seems that latest 'release-1_7' build (and most probably in 1.7.4) is
not using '+towgs' proj parameters when using on-the-fly reprojection.
It is visible when overlaying two layers in different projection where
'towgs' parameter is needed to reproject data accurately. Currently the
error is the same as it would be without specifying 'towgs' parameter.

It was working nicely in older 1.7 releases.

Can anybody confirm ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] idea for settings
Message-ID: <4F59DEA3.6080107@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just wanted to share an idea I had today. In my plugins, I always had 
the problem of never knowing the default values I had set for the 
settings (the info being spread all over the code files), and it was 
always a pain to change a default value (I had to search in all my files 
for all the calls for the setting in question).

So, I created a class with a fake inheritance of QSettings:

class MyPluginSettings():
     def __init__(self):
         self.settings = QSettings("MyPlugin","MyPlugin")

         self.defaultValue = {    "mySettingValue1" : 0,
                                 "SomeTextSetting" : "hello",
                                 "Value4" : 13
                             }

     def value(self,setting):
         if self.defaultValue.has_key(setting) is False:
             raise NameError('MyPlugin has no setting %s' % setting)
         return self.settings.value(setting,self.defaultValue.get(setting))

     def setValue(self,setting,value):
         if self.defaultValue.has_key(setting) is False:
             raise NameError('MyPlugin has no setting %s' % setting)
         self.settings.setValue(setting,value)


You set self.settings = MyPluginSettings() in your plugin, and when you 
do self.settings.value("mySettingValue1"), you don't need to specify the 
default value.
The class will raise an exception if you call for an undefined setting. 
This will avoid typos in settings calls and therefore multiple 
definitions of the same setting.


Don't know if it's useful for you, but I was quite happy with this 
solution....

Greetings,

Denis

Hi,

By the way instead of:
    if self.defaultValue.has_key(setting) is False

You should write this:
    if setting not in self.defaultValue:

It's more "pythonic" and work with list, tuple, set and every things
that implement the __contains__ method (
http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=__contains__#object.__contains__
)

+towgs works for me on 1.7.4, but I have to specifically set the CRS
for the layer because it's not recognised when loading the layer. See
bug #5071. If you manually select the CRS from the layer properties
dialogue does it work?

Hi Ivan,

I made a few tests here and in my case I see that the reprojection using
towgs parameters is broken in qgis-master but works in 1.7.4.

cheers

Craig, thanks for the answer.
I have found that Qgis is not using 'towgs' only if using one of the
projections from installed projection database. If I create custom
projection by 'Settings -> Custom CRS' it is working correctly.


To get things more clear, I am inserting missing projection (see #4945)
to internal database before building. This projection is using 'towgs'.

.prj files lack TOWGS84 WKT

In gdal 1.9 this can be fixed with the config option GDAL_FIX_ESRI_WKT=TOWGS84
see http://www.gdal.org/ogr/classOGRSpatialReference.html#ad556dfdc04d9ec5f1714fc6b5e0eb6a6
and http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/4345

TIcket #5066 also has more info.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help function in new Query Builder
Message-ID: <e0ac7753699c1e464d502dedce2b65d6@carto.net>

 Hi,

 I have a request regarding the new excellent query builder. For some 
 reason, although my QGIS is set to use the english language, I get the 
 message:

 Oops! QGIS can't find help for this function. The help file for xx was 
 not found for your language.

 My suggestion is: display this message as an encouragement for 
 volunteers to translate it, but display the original english help text 
 as well. Most people can read english and for them it would be useful to 
 get the english help, even if they set the main language to german, 
 french or some other language.

 Would this be possible?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

So now the question is which commit between 1.7.4 release and current
'release-1_7' branch is breaking things. I do not see any candidate.

That's the intended behaviour already, but the message just is a bit
misleading, if english help is missing (which is the current case for a lot of
functions).  Fixed in 5e2f96cd3.

Hi,
I could not solve the problem yet.
I tried to load the same raster on mapserver and it works fine!

Any hint?

Also,  the "build virtual raster" tool does not work if a file has
sublayers (GDAL subdatasets), such as HDF4 or netcdf.

I have implemented a fix for this and submitted it as pull request

Hi all

can anyone unapprove plugin SFire [0] uploaded at March 9, 2012, 3:56 pm?
The reasons are:
 1. This is not pure Python plugin. It includes a C code that should be compiled
     before plugin usage
 2. Even Python part does not work because UI and other resources are not
     compiled

I think plugins such SFire should be distributed in another way that
python plugins

Hi all,

there are many QGIS plugins, most of them are Python plugins and several
C++ ones. But some plugins may require 3rd party binaries and/or shared
libraries (like Lizmap plugin). Some developers may want to include this
required binaries into plugin package or even include sources, so users
should compile them before using plugin.

I think we should decide is this allowed or not.

Thanks

Hi devs,

IMHO, a plugin should work out of the box, on all platforms.
The "Experimental" flag could be used for such plugins that require 
compilation or other third parties elements that are not delivered in 
standard.

I'm guessing that very few users are inclined to compile code. They 
just want something to work right now!
Also, remember this mailing list is mainly followed by "power-users" 
who do not mind to compile...

My two cents,
Benoit

Problem not only in compilation (but in case when some parts of plugin
distributed in the form of C/C++ code this is additional difficulties for
most users).

We can't be sure that 3rd party binaries are safe and there are no security
risks (especially on Windows). Python code can be verified by user. I know
that not all users are programers but at least this is possible. But verifying
binary file almost impossible.

Hi all,

After some discussion in the irc #qgis and some thinking, I decided to
release only python code for lizmap, and not the WinSCP (opensource) exe
binary (portable version), as I wanted first. For 2 reasons :
* it increases the size of the plugin zip file
* including exe or windows binaries could "scare" users (or their
antivirus), even if the code is 100% GPL (no way for the users to check the
exe is the real one)
* it is useless for linux (lftp is used instead) and mac users (manual sync
must be done)

Now, I "ask" windows users to download and put WinScp portable version in
some folder and point this folder out within the ui.
In this case, it is a good compromise, as Lizmap plugin can be used only to
configure the web map and save this configuration by pushing the Save
button. Synchronisation can always be done manually with other external
tools or protocols (scp, dropbox, etc.).

So, +1 for not including external binaries in the plugin zip file.

Michael

Don't worry. The QGIS "ecosystem" is growing, so it takes some time to grasp

Great! Thanks. There are more points on the TODO list, hopefully I'll be able 
to come back do the development later this year.

One remark, it should be placed inside "User Plugins" rather than in the top 
level (your problems seem to be a bug, it should work). 

Hey Admins, can anybody move it or should we remove it & create again?

Oh yes! Such instructions would be precious. A common help webpage for whole 
the hub would be the easiest to implement, and hopefully enough. The present 
link to oryginal redmine guide is quite unsuitable for most users.
 
Instead of mailing, the user could see his unapproved plugins and their status 
on the list. In this case the admin could just fill a note for ech plugin (e.g. 
"please fix A and B"). And the user would be informed about plugin metadata 
changed.

It's a bug I think. I was told already about problems with creating projects 
inside this section. But for me it works well. Don't you see an "Add 
subproject" button on http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins ?

Thanks Andreas!
You are right. Still there are 3 different issues with labeling and
tiling:
-No placement outside the BBOX
-Dynamic label placement
-Repeated labels

Larger area (meta buffer) solves only the first issue, the 2nd and 3rd
need work on the WMS side (hence either old labelling or the solution
you mentioned).
This is explained very well in images here:
http://mapproxy.org/docs/latest/labeling.html

I still need a few days to finish uploading my 6 GB of QGIS-Mapproxy
tiles illustrating this! Stay tuned...

I've been using the Mac version of QGIS, compiled and packaged by a
'third party' (Mr. Kyngesburye), for years. I have run his installers
and compiled programs countless times, just as any other regular Mac
QGIS user.

Almost all of his installers require administrator rights, including
the one for QGIS. I have no easy way of completely verifying his
installers and the compiled programs they install. I, as an admin
user, make the decision to install or not. I trust that Mr.
Kyngesburye compiles valid, useful gis tools, and is not installing
anything funky on my Mac.

This should be the same for plugins. Let the user decide. However, the
user should be informed, if a plugin requires additional software,
regardless of origin, at the appropriate time. I agree that the plugin
installer should not, by default, allow arbitrary installation of
compiled programs, but this shouldn't be a roadblock for potential
developers.

There are many plugins that do not work 'out of the box.' IPython for
example. On my Mac, I recently had to compile the zeromq package to
get its python bindings to work. It was totally worth the effort,
though I doubt most regular Mac users would do this. This should not
mean that the plugin remain eternally stuck in the 'Experimental'
category, especially if it is stable for use otherwise.


I have spent many, many hours working on a plugin for QGIS that
requires the QScintilla PyQt binding. While this can be included in
the source builds for QGIS (which I'd like to see), I have, for now,
pre-compiled small versions of Qsci.so for both 10.6 and 10.7 Mac
OSes. I do not see my small 'third party' installer of compiled
software as anything different than what Mr. Kyngesburye is providing.
Nor do I see it as any different than explaining to a Ubuntu user to
run 'apt-get python-qscintilla2' (also requiring admin permission).

I agree there needs to be some modicum of control, but I can't image
the state of add-ons for Firefox, if Mozilla took the same tack. I
think having plugins not install binaries via the plugin installer,
and their developers clearly notifying the user of any extra installs
is enough. Let the users decide beyond that.

it's not the same...
If Kyngchaos were not Kyngchaos his packages would not be in the
QGis download page.

I do not agree.
In the plugins repo anyone can create a new plugin then would
be very unsafe to allow compiled code which nobody can verify.

The user expects that a plugin in the QGis repository is safe,
otherwise this can strongly damage the QGis reputation.

+1, this work is partially done from the plugins installer which shows
a message when a python module is missing, but the message not
enough intuitive for users.

Let's try to simplify the life to users:

if the plugin's author adds important information (e.g. required libs) to
a README file, the plugins repo may display them in the plugin
page (like GitHub does).

Wouldn't it be enough?

Regards.

Agreed, though I'm not sure how apparent this is to new Mac users. I
would venture to guess that some users are concerned when a fairly
large-scale open source project links to an individual's web site for
downloads. I certainly don't have any issues with it, but I haven't
been a regular Mac user for quite awhile, so my perspective may be off
the mark on this. Seems I remember a time when standalone versions of
QGIS were available via the qgis.org site as well. Like other users I
went with Kyngchaos.com because his installers offer more versatility,
e.g. frameworks, offer a more complete workflow, with GRASS, etc., and
are diligently prepared.

I agree 100%. Sorry if my words may have implied I think compiled
software should be in the Official plugin repo. That would bad, as you
have noted. Let me clarify... by plugin installer, I, by proxy, guess
I meant the base repo as well. Isn't there a movement away from third
party repos entirely? When is that anticipated?

Yes. How about a bit further and have __init__.py/metadata sections
listing external dependencies and a description of what they are for?
(Or have I missed that option?) Then the user can be warned
programmatically even if they have downloaded and manually installed
the plugin. User warned on attempted load of plugin, regardless of how
installed. Similar to the notifications for dependencies in Linux
package managers, but not to the point of exhibiting loading errors,
like with missing Python modules.


Similar side note: Here is the not-quite-finished, 'component missing'
notification and link to small installer that I am planning for my
plugin release [0]. With my plugin's approach, a user can install the
base Python plugin, peruse the documentation, tutorial and partial
tool set, then judge if they want to download the additional installer
or uninstall the plugin.

Dear QGIS Developers:
I have been working on a paper for the last year and half. I have been developing QGIS tools as part of the process. I have now completed my paper. It is on bicycle network modeling, and it can be downloaded from the following link http://www.axumcorp.com/SanJose_Bike_Connectivity_final_report.pdf (Most of analysis and all of the images were done in QGIS). It was a very intense work. 

I do not know how to share the plugins I worked on but I will be delighted to have someone else use them. Most of the routines are specifically written for the project. You may check out the document and see if it may benefit another person. Or perhaps another can modify it for their use.

I owe a lot of debt to the user interface of Roadgraph and am grateful for some details on project management, etc. I learned a lot from Sergey Yakushev's work. 

Similar to Sergey's work, the plugin uses a shortest path routine (Vertex Voronoi in an edge network). I could not adopt Sergey's shortest path routine, primarily because my data set was completely different (even though it is produced from a line-string original dataset), and the result is similar but also different. I used vertex and edge attribute details in the course of finding a path. The edge and vertex network was classified with extra attributes instead of just travel metrics. Sergey's work is very elegant. Mine is not. 

I am thankful to all of you working on this product. It has been very useful for my work. Read the document if you can.

I have many times needed help ( I cried and moaned and wept tears of sorrow and laughter) and many of you lent hands and again I say thank you,

Maaza

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Qgis-user] Pyramids and Virtual maps - technical
	details
Message-ID: <4F5CB733.70109@lanet.lv>

Hi,

I have many raster maps (size 2000x2000 pixels). I have created a 
virtual dataset including all of them.

The first question: what pyramids should be built?

1. Large scale pyramids (e.g. 2 and 8 (in terms of gdaladdo) for each 
raster map separately and small scale pyramids (e.g. 16 and 32) for the 
Virtual data set.

OR

2. Full set of pyramids for the Virtual data set.


The second question:  Is it reasonable to make only every second pyramid 
(e.g. 4, 16, 64)? - performance/disk waste issue.

Thank You,
Karlis

Message-ID: <4F5CBB58.5040803@lanet.lv>

Hi,

Please correct if I'm wrong.

The formulae for the Affine transformation can be expressed as follows:

Xc = r5 + Xp * r1 + Yp * r3
Yc = r6 + Xp * r2 + Yp * r4

(Xc, Yc - new coordinates;
Xp, Yp - pixel location;
r1 .. r6 - coefficients.)

In Quantum GIS Georeferencer the meaning of different transformations 
are as follows:

Linear - special case of Affine transformation where r3 = 0 and r2 = 0.

Helmert - special case of Affine transformation where r3 == r2.

Polynominal 1 == Affine transformation.

Thank You for Your time.

I have used this option with a large vrt made of 256x256 png tiles
without any issue. Probably the easiest to do ( a few clicks). Then
performant wise, maybe you have to try both.

Hi

I will try to add my thoughts:
- I would be very happy to see old labeling removed - that's one of
the things to address in 2.0 (but 1.8 must keep compatibility)
- in meanwhile technically old and new labeling are completely
independent from each other - they can be even used both at the same
time ;-) but I wonder who would ever want that
- generally there are two concerns regarding new labeling: 1. missing
features and 2. performance

Ad 1: missing features:
There was a call to make a list of missing features on the wiki page
[1]. In the list I see only two features present in old labeling and
not in new labeling (buffer transparency, label rotation - neither
really crucial). The rest of the items are feature requests and bug
reports. That indicates that feature-wise new labeling is quite in
parity.

Ad 2: performance:
There are cases when labeling is slow: most prominently polygon
labeling tends to be a problem when polygons contain more vertices. I
hope to address this problem with a faster algorithm. Another problem
I am aware of is with general labeling in presence of lots of features
(where each label candidate overlaps with dozens of other features).

Just a note: time for old labeling is already counted within total
layer rendering time, it is not that drawing of old labeling would be
that fast :)

Anyway it's worth noting that when rendering text there are two possibilities:
1. draw text (old labeling) - faster, hard to draw buffers (currently
being drawn by shifting the text several times)
2. convert text to vector path + draw path (new labeling) - slower,
but with nice buffers (antialiased etc). Problems: text is converted
to vectors -> harder postprocessing, bigger buffers are not drawn
correctly.

Hi Mayeul

so maybe you only need an option to tell qgis that features should not
be clipped to current extent before labeling?

Ah, that explains why the text isn't exported as text in svg files.
Would it be possible or make sense to do both. E.g. the text stays text
but a copy is converted and buffers are generated on the copy that is a
path?

I haven't tried that but I expect that it will not look good because
the rendering algorithms are different.

I will be probably moving new labeling to use directly text drawing in
future since path drawing is several times slower...

Hi,

I think text output in SVG is essential. Labels are one of the things that
can always be improved in post-processing. But if labels are only available
as paths, all of them have to be redone to maintain consistency ... awful
amount of work.

Best wishes,

Anita

For what it's worth - the PDFs I've seen produced by ArcGIS and Mapinfo do have the text as text and the buffer as a path, but the buffer is quite simplified, at least for small text (and it can look quite bad).

Hi Paolo,
Please try again...
I'm guessing the HTML parser does not like the '&', I've changed it to 
'and'.

Hi Maaza.
Nice job, thanks. Would you like to add an abstract of it to QGIS case studies?
Also, do you think some part of your work could be integrated in the existing
Roadgraph plugin? Being a C++ plugin, it will be difficult to distribute it if
outside QGIS source code.

Hi Martin,

as I am tiling with QGIS-server, too, your suggestion might solve the 
labelling problem and another problem I realized recently: I have a SVG 
fill for polygons and I experienced cut fills at tile edges. I would 
expect the fill to be on the same place all the time (map units used for 
sizing). So if you could easily change this I would like to give it a try.

Bernhard

But it must be configurable/optional. For traditional printing and
standard (untiled) WMS you mostly want the current behavior of labeling
2.0 where the features are clipped.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis-mapserver - SLD within WMS GetMap request
Message-ID: <4F5E61D5.30602@mapgears.com>

Hi,

   I'm using qgis-mapserv with QGis 1.7.4 on Ubuntu 10.04, using the 
ubuntugis-unstable package.

   I'm currently trying to do a WMS GetMap request with a SLD_BODY 
parameter set with a simple SLD document.  Problem is, I always get the 
original style of the features defined in the .qgs file instead of the 
one defined in the SLD.  Setting a SLD parameter instead pointing to a 
copy of the file doesn't do anything either.  I looked around for clues 
but didn't find any.  I attached a copy of the SLD document in question 
(without a filter) and with with a filter.  My real test-case requires 
the filter and it's entirely built using OpenLayers.Format.SLD, so its 
content needs to be dynamic from a webmapping client application.

   I already got help on IRC from Tim, and he mentioned that Marco 
should be the one knowing the answer to my issue.  SLD_BODY doesn't seem 
to be supported in qgis-mapserv.

Thanks a lot (and a special thanks to Tim for his IRC support),

Hi Alexandre

SLD_BODY works in the developer version (master branch), but not in the 
1_7_4 version.
I've backported the fix to the 1_7 branch (don't know if there will be a 
1.7.5 or if 1.8, which already contains the fix, will be next ).

Btw, now that we have SLD support directly in the symbology classes 
(thanks to Giuseppe!), I'm going to change QGIS server to use that 
instead of the SLD classes in the server (they are still based on old 
symbology).

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

   Gotcha.  I'll try the 1_7 branch then.  Do you have an approximative 
idea when 1.7.5/1.8 will come out ?

Thanks a lot for your support, much appreciated.

please consider also a third category: features that have already been
added but are not working as expected, for example curved and around
centroid labels. There is also a crash under Windows when using certain
vectors/configurations.

As MultiEdit is far more advanced, should the QuickMultiAttributeEdit be

Hi all,

I just recently found that the section headers (in QGroupBox items)
are very different in Master compared to 1.7.

The titles are not in bold and the justification is weird.  Especially
apparent in the "Defalut map appearance..." section of the General tab
of the prefs.

The layer properties pages show the same behavior.

Is there a setting/style sheet somewhere?

Attaching 2 screen shots to illustrate this.

Hi all,

This might be something simple.

What I'm looking for is a way to automate some processes using QGIS but not
via a plugin or having to load the QGIS GUI.

I have a project file that I have setup with a composer for printing to a
pdf and I need to be able to open the project using QGIS and print it from
inside a python script that does other non-qgis things.

Is it possible to:

   - Load QGIS from Python (well I know how to do this using
   QgsApplicaiton.Init())
   - Open the project file
   - Zoom to a location
   - Print the first composer to pdf
   - OR render out the map canvas to a image.

>From what I can see the only way is to create a new composer item and pass
it the composer node from the xml.

Is there any other way to do it apart from having to deal with the XML from
the project.

- Nathan

Hi Andr?s,

the plugin requires the QtSql module.
You have to install the python-qt4-sql package.

Regards.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] undisplayed elements are selected
Message-ID: <4F62E9C7.9020206@gmail.com>

Hi all,

When using the rules style for a layer and defining a scale range, if 
you select by rectangle on the map, everything is selected including 
undisplayed features.

Is there already an issue opened, I searched without any result.

Greetings,

Denis

I would say this could be an expected behaviour as styling is only a
visual thing and doesn't affect the data....maybe.

 hm - I agree with Denis. Features invisible because of scale ranges 
 should not be selectable and should not react to map tips.

 In QGIS Server we filtered the invisible features away in 
 GetFeatureInfo requests. The same should be done for selecting features 
 in QGIS desktop and for the map tips. The rule-based renderer V2 offers 
 a method called willRenderFeature() (see 
 http://doc.qgis.org/api/classQgsRuleBasedRendererV2.html#b514bc63bd9e744faca24236a89b7e4d) 
 that could be used to see if such a feature is displayed or not. But 
 the method says that it has to be called between startRender() and 
 stopRender() calls - so I don't know if it would work for 
 querying/selection features?

 Any thoughts?
 Andreas

some thoughts (unordered):

A) thinking from the table side I can always select any feature there 
regardless if it is currently visible or not. When I zoom to the 
selection then I am responsible that all features are visible in order 
to see my selection. So the current behaviour is just the other way 
round. If I want to exclude features I have to define a query on the 
layer filtering out unwanted features.

B) map visibility can be controlled by three ways:
1) visibility of the layer on/off => features are not selectable in map
2) scale-based visibility of the whole layer => features get selected, 
even when not visible
3) rule based style with scale based visibility for rules (Denis' case) 
=> features get selected, even when not visible
To me case 1 is expected behaviour, cases 2 and 3 are not (although not 
too unexpected when considering thought A), but hard to explain to a user)

- possible solution to accompany A) and B): show all selected features 
in selection color regardless of their individual scale-based 
visibility. No idea if that is feasible.

 For me it would be ok if I can select invisible features from the 
 table, but it feels strange to select invisible features in the map.

 After all my filter is there for a reason - I want them to be invisible 
 and therefore I don't want them to be selectable if they are invisible. 
 QGIS server with GetFeatureInfo behaves like this and I think it is 
 logical.

 It even gets more complicated if you digitize and have snapping 
 settings on a rule-based layer. Think about it - you digitize and 
 suddenly it snaps to some invisible feature - it would be a usability 
 nightmare ...

I agree.

This is a bug then.  Fill a ticket if none exists.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CAD Tools: error in rotation tool
Message-ID: <4F6314F5.9040805@faunalia.it>

Hi all.

When clicking twice on "OK", I get:


Errore durante l'esecuzione di codice Python:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File 
"/home/paolo/.qgis/python/plugins/cadtools/tools/rotateobjecttool.py", 
line 75, in rotateObject
     geom = cadutils.rotate(self.feat.geometry(), self.p1,  angle * 
math.pi / 180)
   File "/home/paolo/.qgis/python/plugins/cadtools/tools/cadutils.py", 
line 136, in rotate
     p1 = QgsPoint(k.x() - point.x(),  k.y() - point.y())
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'x'


I think the error should be intercepted.
All the best.

More thoughts:

I agree that the expected behaviour would be that invisible features are 
not used for any selecting done in the map.
But: how should the behaviour be regarding a spatial query and rule 
based visibility? Its result would depend on the scale then :-(

I just realized features even get labelled when invisible due to a style 
rule but not when a general scale-based visibility is set for the layer. 
This is definitely a bug.

I still favour the idea that _all_ features in the selection should be 
drawn in selection color even when invisible due to a style rule because 
the selection criteria used for selecting e.g. in the table might be 
different from the criteria used in the visibility filter. And in this 
case the user is more interested in the selection criteria. Thus it 
would be consistent to have the spatial query select all features in the 
layer, too.

I think we should distinguish (in QGIS desktop) between rule-based 
filtering and filtering by a layer query. When only looking at the map I 
could use either of them to not display certain features but when I e.g. 
want to snap to features I would always use the layer query to keep 
unwanted features out in the first place. It does not make sense loading 
them in and then hiding them because I do not want to snap to them. So 
display layers and data-input layers are different.

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6O+A8dbZmohxcoFDKDfpZGYGzi4HvnP6h7H3-r+_9dqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Yesterday I uploaded a new version of Lizmap plugin in
http://plugins.qgis.org.
Last version was 1.1 (1)
New version is 1.1.1 (2)
I have changed the "experimental" in metadata.txt from yes to no.

The upload went smoothly, but it is not yet "accepted", and in the lizmap
page (3), the old version is the only one publicly available. I would like
to know If plugin authors should ask validation to the admin for each new
version, or if it is supposed to be automatic for new versions of the same
plugin.

Thanks for the help
Kimaidou

Hi all.
In current master I found a couple of issues using the Print Layout:
- generating the preview for svg images takes a very long time; a known 
problem, but quite annoying on slow machines
- the right panel for images to add is much wider than others, so it 
does not fit small (<1280) screens.
All the best.

well something has changed, and the look of the compiled app is
significantly different than in Designer. This also makes the dialogs
a little confusing as the sections are not clearly separated.

This happens with long titles, like  "Defalut map appearance..." - you
don't get that?

Hi,
Same problem on Ubuntu 11.10 both with QGIS 1.7.4 (from packages) and
1.9 (compiled by myself).
Plugin version: 0.7.1

Same bug even if de-activating all other plugins.

Logs when running from command line:

I'm not sure the last error is relevant: same message appears for Google

No, the title is aligned here on Ubuntu 11.04 and QGis master.
I also tried to resize the dialog but nothing happens.

Hi,

When I use the gtk+ theme (not available in qgis-1.7.4) the titles are
not bold and badly justified.  With other themes, justification is ok
but titles are not bold (like you see), and the groups have frames.

I am using Linux Mint 12 (Ubuntu 11.10) with Cinnamon - might be a bug
with gtk+themes there.

Can you try and see if you get this problem with the gtk+ theme?

thanks,
Etienne

Hi Paolo,

Before, QGIS rendered the SVG files during startup - which was even
worse in my opinion - because often you would open a project and don't
want to print. Somehow it would be great if we could find a way to cache
the rendered SVGs from one session to the next.

We have a student here in Switzerland interested in working on improving
the SVG symbol situation - maybe we can find a better solution as part
of this project - if it is accepted.

Hi Rudi

I think this typically pops up when you upgrade PyQt4 without
recompiling PyQGIS, so the module versions do not match.

Do other versions run fine or the same error appear?

Hi Nathan

yes that's all possible from an external python script with PyQGIS,
without actually starting GUI.

No need to play with XML, everything can be done using API, there is
an example in the cookbook:

Martin,

It's not so much that I don't know how to create a new composer from Python
more that I don't now how to restore a composer item from the project file
using Python.

I'm using the project file that contains composers as a template which I
need to open and print.  What I have seen so far looks like you have to
handle recreating the composer and all its items using the xml like in
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/src/mapserver/qgsprojectparser.cpp

<https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/src/mapserver/qgsprojectparser.cpp>Maybe
the composer object could do with a createFromXML() method which constructs
a composer, and all its children, as per the project file.

Hello,
My name is Brylie Oxley. I am a student at Sierra College in Nevada 
City, CA. I would like to apply for the GSoC program.

I have been studying GIS at Sierra College, where the courses focus on 
proprietary tools. For libre GIS tools to be viable options, we need 
high quality cartographic tools. This is where I see Inkscape as an 
EXCELLENT candidate.

I would like to make an extension for QGIS and/or Inkscape that would 
enable us to send data from QGIS directly to Inkscape. It would also be 
nice to be able to have Inkscape leverage the QGIS API to import 
data/layers into a cartographic project.

I am glad to get any feedback regarding users' experiences sharing data 
between these two programs. I would also like to know what some of the 
components are that I can leverage to create a bridging 
extension/improved cartographic interface for QGIS.

Thank you for your time and consideration,
Brylie Oxley

You may want to look at Richard Duivenvoorde's Simple SVG plugin
written in Python [0][1].

He's done an excellent job of getting useable SVG out of QGIS and into
Inkscape. His plugin can be installed via the QGIS Plugin Installer
(aka, Plugins/Fetch Python Plugins... menu item).

There is also some info on Inkscape's wiki [2]. I use the awesome,
though very expensive, MAPublisher Illustrator plugin [3], but would
love to move over to a FOSS solution. If Inkscape had a plugin with
MAPublisher's basic functionality, you wouldn't necessarily need an
export plugin for QGIS; Inkscape would just be able to use GIS data.

There is certainly a lot that can be done with integrating the two
projects now. It seems Python would be the best scripting glue[4].
Check out the PyQGIS Cookbook and repositories for more info [5].
Beyond data sharing/syncing via Python, true GUI integration may be
very difficult because Inkscape uses GTK+ and QGIS use Qt.

Another solution might be to write a plugin for Inkscape that works
with a web mapping service to pull in and create features, much like
QGIS's web mapping service layers. Look into QGIS's Server for
creating a test server [6]. Currently you can create PDF output with
QGIS Server, so it seems probable it might be able to be made to
output SVG as well.

I, for one, would be very interested in testing any plugins you make
concerning this.

Message-ID: <CACbtZwRpyOabFt01gGVc9YVnewjOQSF2kKrTOnYr0H46DVw8Cg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have been working with QGIS development for quiet sometime, and I hope
most of you know me for doing the Heatmap plugin.

I think its time I announce I am pitching for GSOC this year. I have gone
through the ideas in the ideas[1] page and have been performing some
analysis myself and documenting[2] them to identify the areas where
improvement could be done. Though there are many areas where functionality
could be improved, I think increasing the analytical ability of the package
packs more power.

A good step as discussed earlier[3] is to convert the fTools plugin to C++
and expand the API and improve the scriptability. Along the same lines is
the Processing Framework[4] which would provide the interface between QGIS
and various other external tools and libraries. This again is still in
Python. Expanding the framework would be good, but again I think,
converting it to the native language (C++) would make it more useful.

Both of these two would help in improve the analytical capability of the
software and provide a way to build more upon them.

I think I would go by popular vote from the other developers here.

Kindly help me decide in which direction to go, so I can apply.

I think porting to C++ should be a second step. As Martin has pointed out several
times, prototyping, deploying and testing is far faster in Python, so I would suggest
first finishing to develop the framework in py, leaviong the porting to a second
time, if necessary. The plugin in itself is not doing any heavy computation, so
execution time is not an issue here.
fTools could be reimplemented as an additional backend (using GEOS) of the same
framework.
All the best.

Hi Nathan

 >What I have seen so far looks like you have to handle recreating the 
composer and all its items using the xml like in

There has been some rearrangement in the composer classes (the first API 
break :-) ). With git master version, you should be able to create a 
QgsComposition by calling its readXML Method, then call 
QgsComposition::readItemsFromXML.

The composer is a bit of a special case because it is possible to 
replace label strings, map extent / layer / rotation with parameters. 
And with the legend, there is a workaround to avoid using the x-server. 
So with an external python script, I'd recommend to use 
QgsComposition::readItemsFromXML.

Marco

Hi Brylie

A very good thing would be to improve the SVG export from the print 
composer. In fact, this would mean to improve the SVG export in the Qt 
libraries. And from this work, other Qt applications would automatically 
benefit as well (a large number of applications).

Regards,
Marco

 Hi,

 The first question that I had to ask myself in this thread: what is the 
 reason why one wants to move from QGIS to Inkscape? Are there ways to 
 improve QGIS so this extra step in a separate software isn't necessary 
 any more? Would it be more useful to implement missing features in QGIS 
 rather than spending a lot of time trying to let two separate software 
 packages talk to each other?

 If you really want to work on improving the situation between QGIS and 
 Inkscape I think it would be best to either:

 * work on SVG read/write support in GDAL (something along the lines of 
 http://www.carto.net/svg/utils/shp2svg/ - which is a bit outdated by now 
 -> the idea was to improve GDAL SVG support
 * improve the qtSVG libraries so QGIS can output more semantically rich 
 SVG output (e.g. with layer names, text stays as text, include attribute 
 data in a foreign namespace so that it can be displayed in Inkscape, 
 improve the styling situation, etc.)

 I would be interested/available to discuss options and support your 
 work in some ways if I can.

 Let us know what you decide!

I thinkg that working to the improvement of the Composer would be an
important work. Anyway, like it happens with other GIS softwares, when you
need to refine cartographic output for professional layouts you often need
to use external softwares.
I think the two routes are both important, but they have different targets:

 - improve the composer, to create good quality layouts and automate map
books creations (there are a lot of things that could be refined, like
reference maps, multiple frames management, etc.)
 - work on the GDAL level (SVG or PDF) to have the most information out
from the GIS environment and obtain an unfinished product ready for higher
level graphics work.

I think they are complementary, and they depend on the scope of the needs.

Of course I accept that development in python has a lot of advantages, and
the language is not new to me. I was more concerned about the fact that
development in C++ could yield better expansion of the native API so more
things can be built over.

In case we need to complete the task of finishing the Processing framework
in Python, it would make summer even better :)

We must also must not get stuck in the prototype-that-becomes-full-app mode
where the prototyping turns into a product in itself because porting
becomes to much of a task.

Is there anything currently the Processing Framework that is stopping the
porting of it to C++?

Hi all,

I'm very interested to automate processes from outside of QGIS,too.
I want to create following workflow:
1.)Load vector points from POSTGIS
2.)TIN creation with points
3.)Contour extraction from TIN

The result should look like this here:
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/file/n4633242/tin_qgis_label.jpg 

Is it possible to script this via python? 

Cheers

Hi

>1.)Load vector points from POSTGIS

This is possible with the python bindings (QgisInterface.addVectorLayer)

>2.)TIN creation with points

This is possible with QGIS (DualEdgeTriangulation in qgis_analysis, used 
by interpolation plugin). There is however no python binding for it, so 
only accessible for C++ plugins.

>3.)Contour extraction from TIN

This can only be done indirectly by interpolating the TIN to a raster 
and then use GDAL contour (linking to GDAL library).

Regards,
Marco

Well this sounds very confusing to me :-(
Can you give me an advice how to develope this on the easiest way?

Hi all.
If I create a grid based on the extent of a layer that is in a different SRS from
that of the project (OTF activated), the resulting grid is in the project SRS, but
with the extent in the other SRS, so it is wrong.
Sounds like a bug, confirmed?

Well, the framework is still missing some important bits, e.g.
progress reporting, support to cancel processing, logging, async
execution... I would have also some suggestions for simplification of
core API and for decoupling of core/gui code. It would be good to sort
it out before the actual port to C++.

Hi Paolo,

I have a QGIS master here from the beginning of february, and that is 
working fine with GRASS point layers. Both imported by shapes or newly 
created point layers.
Did you try it also with an older version? The plugin just opens a layer 
via the dataproviders...

You are referring to saving the attribute table to a spreadsheet file 
isn't it? Without an x and y column, you cannot save it to a shapefile.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I will compile master now to see if it still works after that

I have no direct advice to you but a hint to the QGIS devs:
What could we do that the C++ API is better covered by Python bindings?
Would'nd it be wise to allow at least new code only being included in
a stable QGIS version when there exists a corresponding Python bindig
(.SIP file)?

Hi Stefan,

yes that sounds like a valid requirement for code that goes to qgis
core/gui/analysis libraries. For 2.0 we should probably apply some
guidelines for inclusion of new classes or significant extensions of
existing classes:
- API approved by at least one other developer
- covered with unit tests
- python bindings included
- updated developer docs (cookbook?) with some usage examples
If the tests would be written in Python then the tests would also
validate that python bindings are working...

Definitely something worth a discussion at the hackfest...

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg9-CT5Lv8gta46D4jU+242LTh8inmwwpqDWkwEzu08qdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm currently looking at building a data collection program based on QGIS.
One of the requirements is that it must have an offline datastore with
syncing to the server on demand/timed.

I have tried the Offline editing plugin but it's not quite what I was
looking for.  More looking for something that you press once and it syncs
all the changes from upstream and downstream but leaves the project
offline.  The offline plugin currently returns the project to a online
state when used and recreates the database when going offline again.

Does anyone know of anything I can use with PostGIS? I have been looking at
Postgres replication but it's looking like a real pain in the neck to setup.

Regards,
Nathan

In the case of the triangulation,

Yes and no. As you know, we have tried to do so and found that it's
very difficult for somebody other than the code author to add those
files.

I understand that programmers are lazy - I'm also a programmer :-> We
could differentiate between rapid prototyping C++ code in the core and
"stable".

In case of stable I would stick with this rule. When we added SIP
files recently we looked for better tools to support producing these
but did not found yet.

As another argument for this rule I'd like to argue that I like Python
plugins because it's faster and easier to develop (except you are a
C++ Jedi :->). So it's somehow a contradiction if you add C++ code
without Python binding because then you exclude Python programmers to
experiment with.

It is not easier for the C++ code author to create the bindings than for 
others.
Additionally, creating the sip files is not enough, the bindings need to 
be tested (as with Python, most problems only show up at runtime). 
Therefore it is better if the programmer that uses the binding creates 
the sip files. Luckily, in many cases, the c++ author is also the first 
binding user. But if not, there is no reason to force creation of the 
bindings.

 >I understand that programmers are lazy

I see this holds true for C++ programmers as well as for Python 
programmers :-)

Marco

Well, what I said was what a C++ programmer told me. And once is for
sure: .SIP look rather like header files and have to be compiled.
Python programmers only compile on the fly ;->

Marco, I would disagree here.

Usually there are only few things that need to be sorted out in SIP
files, typically:
- input/output parameter annotations: In, Out
- ownership transfer annotations: Transfer, TransferBack, TransferThis, Factory
The c++ author knows the semantics - someone who just wants to use
that code does not. Ideally these things should be clear from doxygen
documentation. However sometimes the header is not that well
documented, so the person adding SIP files would need to look into the
code.

Anyway I do not expect from developers to make use of some advanced
SIP annotations that require writing some code with python/sip api.

Hi folks

Just a few moments ago, I started the Qgis 1.7 cycle on Debian main for
wheezy. Thanks your moving to git, we are currently maintaining a full
clone of your git repository here:

git://git.debian.org/git/pkg-grass/qgis.git

where a debian branch now lives. Currently it is follwing the 1.7 branch
and ATM 1.7.5 is the target version for wheezy (7.0). I changed a few
things in the debian/ tree to respect current policy and main changes
will go in *.debiangis templates.

That should allow you staying on sync with our tree (and next ubuntu
versions as a natural follow-up). At the same time, I'll merge from time
to time your changes. Now it's time to wait for the usual NEW queue
delay and see the usual set of failed-to-build reports on some of 
our exotic archs ;-)

Thanks Frankie - a major achievement. Looking forward to see the package hitting

ok, tried on Linux, and it works as expected. I had that problem on a win pc, with
1.7.4, but I do not have it available here, so cannot test further.

Confirmed:
- add a WMS layer (e.g. drainage from DM Solutions)
- get the error as above.

That is not the QGIS project. It is something added by Sourcepole and is obviously confusing. It should be named something different.

The "real" QGIS project is here: https://www.ohloh.net/p/3663

Sourcepole can update their "sandbox".

Ideally, it works like that. However I recall that often there are 
additional things to consider:
- write conversion code for template classes
- convert to subclass
- problems if you include a class that somehow indirectly includes a 
header of a dependency (gdal, geos, gps)

But ok, even if it is easier for the code author to resolve that. There 
is still the fact that in an opensource project people work what they 
are interested in (or what they need for their job). So telling other 
people to do something they don't need is usually not a success.

Regards,
Marco

Hi all,

I just read about running python scrips from Qgis Console(article by 
Gary Sherman 
http://spatialgalaxy.net/2012/01/27/qgis-running-scripts-in-the-python-console/). 
I am trying rotate each point in a layer based on a center point. I 
managed some code by copying from the CadTools plugin(by Stefan 
Ziegler). Whenever i run this from qgis console, it crashes the 
application. Can somebody point me in the right direction? Please find 
the code below. I have to admit that i started python only yesterday.

Note: I am not sure if this is the place to ask this. But i have been 
inspired by reading

Subject: [Qgis-developer] direct mdb read in QGis?
Message-ID: <1332261023586-4637313.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
For my own use, I access mdb's through ODBC access and it works fine. It is
not quite user-friendly since you first have to define a user or system dsn
and then fill the connection form in qgis. 
Bigger problem for me, I deployed QGis on 5 Citrix servers (300 users), and
user-defined-DSN's are disabled for security reasons.. Access to the MS DSN
manager is locked too.. 
*So I have no way to allow qgis users to read MS Access mdb's. *

I have seen that OGR 1.9 allows optionnal direct access connections: 
http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_mdb.html http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_mdb.html .

So, my question: Is it reasonnable (technically) to ask for direct access to
mdb's databases in Qgis? Is it hard work or not? Do we need to use Java
Jackcess library as mentionned in OGR doc?  Is it an OGR issue instead of
Qgis?

I would be pleased to know if I'm alone with this concern.. thanks for your
feedbacks

/NB:  I do want classical access to non geographical tables and not esri's
mdb layers. /

if you use QGIS compiled against gdal 1.9 (as it is now in osgeo4w)
you'll get out of the box support for the personal geodatabase format. I
just tested and it seems to work fine.

I'm not sure I understand your question, but here are some resources
for translating a PyQGIS plugin:

http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/linguist-manual.html

http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qobject.html#tr

http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/html/i18n.html

Basically, you need to wrap all visible, translatable strings with a
given QObject's tr() or trUtf8() method, or
QtGui.QApplication.translate(). Then, pylupdate4 can be used to
generate the .ts files for use in Qt Linguist.

When working in Qt Creator or Designer, make sure any gui item's text
you want translated has 'translatable' checked (default). Then, it's
pyuic4-generated .py will have wrapped strings.

Most PyQGIS deployed plugins have their .pro file removed, but the
'Shift Points' and 'EasyPrint' plugins have a .pro, MAKEFILE and i18n
directory setup in their source you can examine. Both also show how to
instantiate the QTranslator() object in their base classes, for
effecting the plugin's on-the-fly translation.

Thanks Giovanni, I had no problem opening geodatabase feature class. What I
want is opening MS Access alphanumerical tables (and make join afterwards) 
Trying to open a simple MS Access 2003 mdb with geodatabase driver (in "add

Do I miss something?

Well, at first sight it's related more to databases than to vectors. On the 
other hand, this way we start mixing shapefiles with databases. What do you 
think?

Hi Vinayan

I can run your script on qgis 1.7.4,
but I change few points adapt to script runner plugin(see following link).
 
http://spatialgalaxy.net/2012/01/29/script-runner-a-plugin-to-run-python-scripts-in-qgis/

Please run this script on script runner.
  http://d.hatena.ne.jp/waigani/files/rotate.py?d=download

If you have crash again, I need more infomation (OS? version? etc..).

Hi all.
In a fresh installation on win, the plugin is inactive by default: is 
this reasonable? I would vote for having it active.
Should I open a ticket?

Hi all.
The dialog window in GDALTools (just tested the virtual raster>select 
folder) does not allow the user to access to the network on windows 
(something like \\srv1\Folder\etc).
This is a major limitation: can it be fixed?
Thanks.

Hello! sorry for my English, I teach it :)
I would like to participate in the gsoc, i like idea with processing
framework (http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2012),
specifically "Add more backends to the Processing Framework". just
before it, in gis-lab irc channel we came to like idea. but in our
backends list was another plugin (HPGL). yet the idea of processing
framework i like more then others.
to whom should I contact?

So, the idea is to extend ProcessingFramework with new
backends, with main focus on HPGL library [0] which is
very handy for analysis. Also this work may include other
backends, for example GDAL.

Any opinions and comments?

I think, the more backends the better. However, there is still some 
important work to be done on the framework itself, as Martin has pointed 
out.
Please consider also the availability of packages for the backend for 
all major platforms, as this has proved to be a serious hindrance.
All the best.

Hi Asahi,

Thanks a lot for taking your time to review. Appreciate uploading the
edited file. Helped me a lot. And the new script-runner  plugin is simply
stunning.

Thank you

Just a quick comment that might be interesting related to that topic.

I am about to release the first version of the SEXTANTE platform for
QGIS. It contains a toolbox, a graphical modeler, script creator
(creation of new algorithms from scripts), a batch processing
interface, history, and much more. It currently supports SAGA, GRASS
and R algorithm (R scripts), and I have also added some built-in QGIS
processes (the ftools ones and the mmqgis ones). Creation of new
algorithms and new providers it is rather easy.

If you are familiar with the SEXTANTE processing framework, it is
basically the same thing, with some added new things and improvements.

I wanted to wait a bit more until it is more or less stable, but since
I see some action in the QGIS processing area, I think it is worth
mentioning it now, so you can consider it.

Anyway, for those interested, source code of the QGIS SEXTANTE plugin
is available in the SEXTANTE SVN at googlecode, and as I said, a first
version will probably be released soon. A help manual is also almost
finished, with around 40 pages describing the framework

Regards

I'm already inside the GC svn to see the nice things you produced ;)

I am changing a lot of things now (plenty of small ideas!), so it
might be unstable, but as I said, I hope to have it ready soon.

The QGIS community is very active and gives a lot of feedback, much
more, in my opinion, than what you can find with gvSIG or other GISs
currently using SEXTANTE, so I am very excited about this.

The only difference is that in QGIS there will no be native SEXTANTE
algorithms, but just third party ones, so I am focusing on the
processing framework itself.

Regards

My idea was to start translating (as a free time exercise) some of the
native SEXTANTE algorithms to Qgis.
Is SEXTANTE for Qgis meant to be run under the processing framework, or it
will be kept also as an indepenent plugin?

SEXTANTE for QGIS  is itself a processing framework (with toolbox,
graphical modeler, batch processing interface, etc.) just like the one
for gvSIG. The idea is that I have migrated all the framework itself,
but not the algorithms...but of course they can be migrated as well
(in fact, it is now even easier to create new algorithms than it is in
SEXTANTE for gvSIG)

Hmm... so if I understand correctly now we have two frameworks:
ProcessingFramework (developed last year by Camilo Polymeris)
and SEXTANTE framework.

I didn't tested SEXTANTE framework yet, but seems we should
decide and leave only one framework to avoid confusing and
duplication of work

It feels like driving drunk whenever starting qgis: every functionality
is duplicated :D

Ok, that's what I supposed. We're talking about two different things: your
framework and  the "geoprocessing framework" that started some time ago. I
don't know if Camilo (or others) are still working actively on that.
I can imagine that your experience with the "abstraction level" development
for SEXTANTE will be an important plus to the development of such a
framework... And I hope the development will converge on one of the twos,
otherwise it would a waste of resources.

The main problem I see is that sextante is in java, and I believe it 
will be very difficult to introduce such an heavy dependency.
All the best.

Paolo, SEXTANTE for QGis will be completely in Python, as you can see from
the code in source.
As Victor said, the algorithms hasn't been imported. He has reproduced the
"abstraction" of SEXTANTE, and at the moment the only algorithms that have
been imported are third-party (like fTools) and the bindings to SAGA and
Grass.

If there is possibility that output parameter of the module can have any
type, how can I handle with modules' outputs? Or just raster/vector layers
are outputs?

I mean how can I keep outputs after execution of module (
processing.Framework['module'].execute() ). I am working on 'workflow
builder'. I can connect modules or set values by myself. Now I want execute
whole 'graph', so that's why I need to keep outputs.

I was looking at present modules and types of output are just raster/vector
layers or the basic type Parameter. So is there possibility that output type
could be something like string, bool, int...?

Message-ID: <CALCNqkYHcRsMn-dqMq6+1VpN_aCpJdJyCzbjprgknp3WzkRLZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

Well its been a long while (too long for some, not long enough for
others I guess) but it is time to wrap up 1.8. Some people have asked
that we do release candidates etc and generally take things a little
slower before labelling 1.8 as 'stable'. To that end, I will aim to do
one or more release candidates before the final 1.8 release. I would
like to do the first RC release during the Lyon hackfest so we need to
kick things into gear:

* if you have any outstanding features or api extensions (no breakages
please) that are not yet patched / backported into the 1.8 branch
pleased do so as before 31 March 23h59 GMT 2012 to make sure your
features make it into the release.
* string freeze will take effect from the day before the hackfest
starts i.e. 11 April 23h59 GMT2012 after which point only bug fixes
will be accepted in the 1.8 branch.
* I will put out the RC during the Lyon meetup, and we will allow
translation contributions and bug fixes to continue until the point
where we decide we are going to put out 1.8 final

Does anyone have thoughts on a nice name and logo for the 1.8 release?
Candidates might be Lisbon, Zurich, Lyon or something different?

Regards

if we follow the HF history it should be "Lisbon" ;)

cheers!

I thought you might say that! Are their any heavily trademarked
products called Lisbon out there in the GIS space? Maybe better would
be to use the local neighbourhood of the university?

There is the nearest thing with Lisbon in its name and GIS related ->

http://www.wipo.int/lisbon/en/

And there is some nice historical map which would be great (moons are 
gone, old maps are the new trend) ->

Hi Paolo,

We are investigating your issue.

Which version of the CSW plugin are you using?

I have given a look to the code. Amazing work Victor!
As soon as you stabilize it I will surely test it. Let us know ;)

This SEXTANTE plugin is pretty bloody cool.  Is it possible to currently
use the plugin to do work, I can't seem to get any of the modules to pick
up that I have a layer loaded.

Hi again.

This issue was a server upgrade problem with sqlalchemy, not pycsw.

Thanks for catching this up :)
It is now fixed.

Is SEXTANTE plugin live now?

Anyway, we can browse the python code here.

I have been able to checkout it and run it but, As Victor has said, its
code is changing rapidly, it cannot be considered stable yet.

Victor, so you have rewritten all sextante in python? Wow!
Or there is a "Save as Python" menu in Eclipse? ;)
Victor, could you please package it ad add it to http://plugins.qgis.org/ ?
In this way you'll have a much earlier and wider testing.
If you need it, we have a script to autogenerate the package.
All the best, and thanks a lot.

Hi all.
After upgrade, the plugin is still marked as upgradeable. The usual versioning
problem, I guess. It would be good to make the process more automatic, to make life
easier for developers and users.
All the best.

Confirmed, thanks.
Could we add it to sample servers, if you can add just a sample WMS and a

Great thing, thanks.
May I suggest to release the first RC *before* the HF? This way, some of the HF (and
much of the participation of users during that weekend) could be devoted to heavy
testing and bug squashing.
All the best.

Hi,

in my view any parameter type that could be specified as an input
should be allowed also for output - not just layers. For example: a
module that does statistics on a layer and returns mean and standard
deviation - these would be just two scalar output values and could be
used by some other module. In general, both inputs and outputs should
ideally be treated the same way: they are variables (parameters) of
some type and with some value.

I would suggest to store the results in the module which calculated
them - other modules that use those result would ask the module.

Cheers
Martin

Yes I love the old maps themes....+1 from me. The map you referenced
has a bug copyright on it at the bottom. Can you find one that is ok
for use to use (or get confirmation to use that one)?

Ok then I will adjust the timeline to:

* if you have any outstanding features or api extensions (no breakages
please) that are not yet patched / backported into the 1.8 branch
pleased do so as before 31 March 23h59 GMT 2012 to make sure your
features make it into the release.
* string freeze will take effect from 7 April 23h59 GMT2012 after
which point only bug fixes
will be accepted in the 1.8 branch.
* I will put out the RC 8 April 23h59 GMT2012p, and we will allow
translation contributions and bug fixes to continue until the point
where we decide we are going to put out 1.8 final

Ill send out a new notice so the above information does not get lost
in this thread.

Regards

Tim

Hi guys,

did you see another framework based on SEXTANTE [0, 1]? Maybe it is
better to concentrate on one of them to avoid duplicating work?

Sure, having two frameworks makes no sense.
Anyone had the time to check the new sextante implementation?

This could be seen as a reference to a deprecated coding language :)

Please, don't consider this a stable version. While most things are
kinda finished and work, I am still changing small thing that might
affect how it works. For instance, I tried to incorporate afew lines
of code to avoid SEXTANTE showing layers from remote services...but
ended up blocking all layers (which might explain what an user
commented before...)

As soon as I have it more or less ready to test (that means, surely
with bugs but not with unfinished stuff), i will for sure use the
plugins repository

Also, I am mostly testing things on windows, and, since it calls other
apps using the command-line, there might be big differences. However,
i hope they are easy to solve, and i prefer to concentrate on the
framework itself now.

Thanks for your support

Regards

Just a quick note for those of you that have started having a look at
SEXTANTE. I have uploaded the SEXTANTE for QGIS manual to the SVN
(LaTeX source where already available, but now there is a pdf in the
sextante folder, so you can read it or access it from QGIS selecting
"SEXTANTE Help")

Please, read the manual to know how SEXTANTE works (even if you have
used SEXTANTE for gvSIG, since there are differences) and how to
correctly set it up.

Comments and ideas are more than welcome :-)

Victor,

Thanks for giving us (QGIS users) SEXTANTE.

I think most of us are not using gvSIG,  we QGIS users :-). No need to
worry about anything. We will read the manual.

Download the manual.pdf here.

I think QGIS should make a "press release" on SEXTANTE for QGIS in QGIS website.

Call it "Lisboa".

Here's a good Picture: http://images.wikia.com/artepedia/pt/images/7/7b/Rosa-dos-Ventos-do-Padrao-dos-Descobrimentos.jpg

I am not aware of any trademark with the name of the capital...I think it's not possible to register(??)

There is the nearest thing with Lisbon in its name and GIS related ->

http://www.wipo.int/lisbon/en/

And there is some nice historical map which would be great (moons are gone, old maps are the new trend) ->

ok, thanks. please consider that we have an "experimental" tag, so normal users will

Hi!

I am sure once it is stable.. and only Victor as the Creator can decide
that - we will surely make a proud press statement everywhere in the www :)
Thanks to Victor for this great contribution ..

kind regards
Werner

P.S: as a small notice beside that .. we should really take care not to
confuse users by using a lot of different frameworks .. I vote for a
discussion in Lyon about using/creating/integrating different
frameworks. probably there is a way to use them all under one umbrella?

Nathan, thanks for proposing not to put pressure on me :-). I think
that I will have things ready soon and then I would like the community
to test everything. Honestly, I wanted to wait a bit more, but saw the
email about the processing framework and thought it was worth
advancing it...but i hope that things do not go too fast now. Better
to take it easily :-)

Can any one tell me about that Lyon meeting/event? I live in France,
so it is very easy for me to go there, and would love to meet other
developers and people from the QGIS community, and discuss whatever
with them

Thanks again

Hi Victor!

just take a look at that Webpage:

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/7_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Lyon_2012

That should give you all information you need.

Hope to see you there!
kind regards
Werner

Oddly enough, in the server world they praise duplication, redundancy
etc. :-) I think development duplication is not always bad - it lets
us evaluate different designs and approaches and pick the best of
breed. We just need to by choosy and only add one candidate for each
functional area into QGIS as it ships. Especially leading up to 2.0 we
need to declutter and unit test what we have rather than duplicate
stuff.

IMHO duplication in analysis is good, as it allows to check the validity of results.
Duplication in the interface is bad, as it confuses the user.
All the best.

Agreed. And now IMO we have duplication of interface but not analysis
algorithms.

yes, we do have it, thanks to other sw we integrate; e.g., slope and aspect are in
qgis-core, in gdaltools, in gras, and in saga.

It's not such a bad thing having all those options available but it must be
presented in a way so you know which one is coming from where. It's not so
much have the same function from 3 different 3rd party programs + QGIS more
that all the interfaces are all different.  Something like SEXTANTE
addresses this IMO, all in one place and easy to see what is where.

The purpose of a "geoprocessing framework" was exactly that, unify the way
algorithms get exposed to the user.
Victor has given a big boost to this with SEXTANTE, and it should let the
user mix the modules easily to set up processing flows from different
algorithms...

sextantegis.com is the official one. The google code one is where the
code is kept. The joinup one is our previous platform, but for some
reason they do not remove the project from there, although we have
asked that many times :-(

By the way, I also think that duplication is not bad, and some
algorithms in SEXTANTE will be repeated, but that is good as long as
the interface is clear and represents a global entry point for all
analysis task whitin QGIS (that is what I am trying to do...)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] finding custom svg from project file assumes only
 on level of directories under SvgPath
Message-ID: <CACw3ADi9q6PRiMmFQqdjU+-E6Ju0SfLG5irHC8wWbeAd=xvtQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've probably found a bug in using a custom svg for symbology.
I've tested it in 1.7.4 and master.

In order to use a custom svg file I've dropped it into
~homedir/.qgis/svg/<custom_directory>/<custom_subdirectory>

I'm able to use the svg both with 1.7.4 and with master.
I see it in the list of svgs, I can select it and it is drawn
correctly, its path is correctly saved in project file (1.7.4
version).

However reopening the project qgis 1.7.4 is not able to find the file,
resulting in

"Warning: QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified
Warning: Cannot open file '', because: No file name specified"


<custom_directory> = custom
<custom_subdirectory> = ctr

Also master code is not able to find svg, and Debug version log the
following lines

Debug: src/core/symbology-ng/qgsmarkersymbollayerv2.cpp: 798:
(symbolNameToPath) SvgPath: /usr/local/share/qgis/svg/
Debug: src/core/symbology-ng/qgsmarkersymbollayerv2.cpp: 804:
(symbolNameToPath) Alternative svg path:
/usr/local/share/qgis/svg//ctr/0706.svg
Debug: src/core/symbology-ng/qgsmarkersymbollayerv2.cpp: 827:
(symbolNameToPath) Computed alternate path but no svg there either
Debug: src/core/symbology-ng/qgsmarkersymbollayerv2.cpp: 798:
(symbolNameToPath) SvgPath: /home/monfardini/.qgis//svg/
Debug: src/core/symbology-ng/qgsmarkersymbollayerv2.cpp: 804:
(symbolNameToPath) Alternative svg path:
/home/monfardini/.qgis//svg//ctr/0706.svg <--
Debug: src/core/symbology-ng/qgsmarkersymbollayerv2.cpp: 827:
(symbolNameToPath) Computed alternate path but no svg there either

The directory "custom" has been wiped from the path (it should be
/home/monfardini/.qgis//svg/custom/ctr/0706.svg instead of
/home/monfardini/.qgis//svg//ctr/0706.svg)

so it appears that code assumes only one level of directories under SvgPath

I've opened the following bug: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5222

Gabriele

GDAL can use ecw's sdk 3.3 or 4, the standalone qgis version is built 
against 3.3 which is an outdated piece of junk but is under a licence 
that allows some kind of redistribution.

On the other side you've the free 4.x sdk which works better but is a 
really pain to get and joined by an even more painful license. Or you 
can buy it.

And then you also have to take in account that if you use their binaries 
then you are not even garanted that your Windows desktops will accept 
them without throwing up because of some dll/mvc++ mismatch.

My advice would be to ask the IGN to provide you the TIFF and then adapt 
them to your taste, that's what we are doing here.

Well, as long as you just need the decompression part of the sdk, the 3.3 
version seems to do the job. You can grab one of the builds available at 
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/ (make sure to download the package with the 
ecw pluging as well) and convert your ecw's to geotiff for example.

Hey,

should if you made it.

I was trying to change the ticket priority from normal to high! 

I can not edit MULTIPOLYGON geometries stored in postgis, 
I would understand if this is just my problem or if someone else has the
same issue!

Message-ID: <CALCNqkboLk4HfEbXdve1cB26q2zypWWWVJfTpDpkADp-A9d_WA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

@Otto - I have been rethinking the strategy we discussed in Zurich of
having translations in branches / subtrees.

Newer versions of sphinx support gettext for internationalisation[1].
Unfortunately the cookbook is translated by 'full copy' translation
which I think is going to be much more work for translators to
maintain in the future and misses out some opportunities for real
collaborative translation work. Can anyone think of a reasonable way
to move the existing translations into gettext? At the very least I
would like to ensure that we don't take this 'multiple copy' approach
when migrating the other documentation (especially the user manual).
@Paolo Corti - can you confirm if it was also your idea to use gettext
approach and if that works with the web translation platform you will
implement? By the way newer versions of QtLinguist can deal with .po
files too so there is a nice desktop gui option for doing translations
too.

Paolo, will you come to the HF in Lyon ? This would be the good place to

Hello all,

It is great that so many things are happening with regards to improving the
analytical capabilities of QGIS. But as suggested earlier, it brings a lot
of cloud over the original intent of the thread - GSOC application. With
just 3 more days for the applications to start, it would be better if
uncertainties are reduced and proposal could be written.

I second that.  We should not put strong requirements on contributions.  Neat
things could not find their way into QGIS if we require people to jump though
many hoops.

C++ code without SIP bindings is better than no code a all.  The SIP bindings
could also be added by someone else.

If people need more than there is, they can always ask for it (filing a feature
request), (learn how to) add it themselves or ultimatly hire someone to do it.

Hello,

On Windows we work with ECW a long time and work very well. (QGIS 1.7.4, GDAL 1.8). Currently it's a problem on GDAL 1.9 and trunk versions because ECW GDAL plugin  not exist.

Regards, Joze

Subject: [Qgis-developer] alsmost unusable identify and select tools
Message-ID: <4F6C2C6C.40605@gmail.com>

Hi,

Since one or two weeks, in master, I have problems with the identify and 
select tools. When identifying or selecting a single feature, I have 
around 80-95% of failed clicks (i.e. no results, or even a wrng 
feature). When I use select by rectangle, the behavior is better but not 
perfect either.

It's like the elements there was a shift on the map of the 
identification test.
I looked for a change in the settings, and did not find anything. I have 
not problem in 1.7.4

Am I the only one having problems?
Did I miss something in the settings?
Is there a tweak with snapping options?

PS: I use PostGIS 2.0. Could it be this?

Thanks a lot

Denis

It was a little bit unfair to start the popular name discussion in the middle 
of the FOSSGIS conference, which many german speaking QGIS people were 
attending... ;-)
So there was no chance to bring a nice Swiss picture into the release. Can we 
therefore make a reservation for the famous 2.0 release ?

workshops and there was also a user meeting together with the GRASS community.

Hi Tim

yes you are definitely correct, latest versions of Sphinx (from 1.1)
supports internationalization, and that is exactly the approach I have
been considering with Paolo Cavallini and Alessandro Pasotti.

The idea is to keep the set of the original documentation as *.rst
files in English (big effort will be needed here, because as far as I
can see, only the Python CB is in .rst format at this time).
At that point, via sphinx, we will generate the templates files (*.po)
for each of the language we want to translate the documentation in
(via the gettext option of sphinx-build).
We can keep the set of the original *.rst English files and all the
*.po files in git, and commit modification all along the way (so it
will also possible to generate a whole set of html/pdf documentation
for each version/release).

I can figure out two approach for managing the edit of the *.po files:

* a very basic workflow, where each translator will use her/his
favourite editor (vi/gedit/notepad whatever), modify the *.po files
and then commit to git
* put in production a web application like Pootle [1], that will
provide a very convenient user interface for translators, and provide
at the same time useful stats regarding the ongoing translations. In
this case we will have a scheduled job getting latest version of
.rst/.po files and commit them to git (note that using this approach
we will avoid to translators the git overhead as well).

Finally we could schedule a job (or a git hock to trigger the process
as soon as some new .rst/.po file is committed), getting latest doc
from git, compile the *.po files to *.mo files (with the msgfmt
command), compile the Sphinx project. Then we will have an html (and
pdf) documentation set for each language we are supporting and still
with the same job we could deploy it to the QGIS web site.

The Pootle application looks to me a bit heavy, but very handy, so it
would be a very convenient way for editors to manage their work.
And, by the way, it is a full Django project, so at this time, for
answering a previous question of you, we will not be able to integrate
it in the same project where we are keeping the plugin platform.
Unless we don't want to dig in source and adapt it for our situation,
but not sure is the best approach and how long does this take (need to
investigate more here!).

@Jean Roc, I hope we can meet in Lyon, still not sure that I will be
able to join the HF, but in the case I am not able to be in France, I
will definitely attend it remotely from Italy, and I am pretty sure we
can still get the desired results ;)

ciao

Hey all,

Good news everyone! [1]

QGIS now has a native MS SQL provider 2008.  The provider can found using
the new toolbar button (purple icon) or in the MS SQL node in the QBrowser
tree.

The work was sponsored by *Digital Mapping Solutions* (Australia)[2] and
completed by Tamas Szekeres

Any bugs can be assigned to "tamas" on hub.qgis.org.

Thanks to both *Digital Mapping Solutions and Tamas.  This addition will
open QGIS up to a whole new set of users who have to use MS SQL but love
QGIS.  *

Currently this is only in master but I will port it to 1.8 over the next
hour of two.

Hi all.
Testing the plugin. A couple of issues:
- only map units can be used for distance; would it be possible to use also pixel?
- the max length is only 3 digits; it would be good to use also larger numbers.
Thanks.

Simple answer, no, but I'm sure we can get some added.  Unit testing a
provider could be pretty tricky.

Thank you, all,
ECW/win was OK with trunk (1.9.90) until 2 days before new nightly... perhaps, since, gdal used has been 1.9???!!!
It's time to have an opensource wavelets compression!!!
1) Somebody knows Epsilon CW? Is -it possible with GDAL1.9 linux and win?
2) How to grab one of the builds available at http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/, have you a method?
Best regards

Hello,

On Windows we work with ECW a long time and work very well. (QGIS 1.7.4, GDAL 1.8). Currently it's a problem on GDAL 1.9 and trunk versions because ECW GDAL plugin  not exist.

Hi Paolo,

Thanks a lot for the feedback.

1. I don't really see the interest of using pixels for distance. In what 
case would it be needed? I think it is very unlikely we'll have measure 
in pixels. Do you have any example?

2. I suggest to set this by setting. I'll put an option to give number 
of digits for the distance. What do you think?

3. Did you had any other trouble to understand the plugin? I am not sure 
it is really easy to use, bu I don't know how to make it simpler...

Thanks again

Denis

Yes, you should perhaps open a ticket (if not already done by someone else) in
OSGeo4W trac instance to ask for the gdal-ecw plugin to be regenerated against
GDAL 1.9

> It's time to have an opensource wavelets compression!!!
> 1) Somebody knows Epsilon CW? Is -it possible with GDAL1.9 linux and win?

Yes, but the Epsilon lib won't read ECWs and you have probably to build GDAL
yourself against it because few packages will build it.

> 2) How to grab one of the builds available at

Yes, just click on the links ;-) More seriously, what stops you ? You can for
example try
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/PackageList.aspx?file=release-1500-gdal-1-9-mapserver-6-0.zip
and download both release-1500-gdal-1-9-mapserver-6-0.zip and
gdal-19-1500-ecw.msi . Note that the builds from that site won't probably
integrate well with qgis, but you can at least do offline conversions with them.

not really (see below)

too may settings tend to trouble users. I do not see a big problem having a wider space.

I did not fin it difficult to use, but frankly, it is difficult to imagine what to
use it for.
Perhaps you could provide in the help an use case?
All the best.

This discussion goes somewhat similar as it was in the "dark days of
hacking" when there was no requirement to add a unit test in new
contributions to mature projects: Of course the code works without and
it hopefully does its job for the contributor. But then, the arguments
succeeded that it's the original author - i.e. who knows the code best
- which the one who should add the unit tests too.

I would not implement a new raster format.?

I suggest you look at JPEG2000. Its wavelet based and there are several open source implementations (OpenJPEG, Jasper, etc)

Well, you might just start by testing the files produced by Epsilon before
inventing a new format ;-) As far as the ECW format itself, I don't think there
will be an opensource implementation for the decoder because the format is
non-documented, and even if it was documented, there are a few patents floating
around which might prevent implementing it in countries allowing software
patents (USA...)

You can try TIF with JPEG compression to reduce the size a bit, or use JPEG2000
that begins to have viable OpenSource implementations, like OpenJPEG, although
still significantly slower than proprietary implementations.

Fred,

Ah, ok, this is why I asked.  I would encourage you to file a ticket
against OSGeo4W.  I will aim to upgrade the gdal-ecw package to work
with the new GDAL 1.9 package (gdal).  With luck I could do this over
the weekend.

With all due respect, if you had explained the problem was
specifically with OSGeo4W to start I might have already had a plugin
built for you.

If you find a GDAL 1.9 ECW plugin build from other sources you could drop it in:

 C:/OSGeo4W/bin/gdalplugins/1.9/

This will only work safely if the plugin is built with the same version of MSVC
as GDAL 1.9 (Visual Studio 2008 in this case).

Hi, Barry,
I do not understand your answer! In the French education, when the
IGN(NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE) gives us rasters of a department for
training, they are in ECW (10 Go by department!) what makes 100 Go in TIF:
it is uncontrolled! 
But I had the other more constructive answers, in particular on OpenJpeg... 
I am not "protesting": I look for solutions for my students! :)
Is it the image that you have French?
Best regards
Fred

 Is there not a typical French solution, which is to protest? :)

 I just had a quick look at some of the things I could find on the IGN web
site and they seem to be fairly open formats, I can't find ECWs anywhere.
But of course, if there was a data set I really wanted to use, that would be
the one!

Hi Fred, as Frank said a new ecw plugin for gdal 1.9/the ecw free sdk

Dear dev.,

SR_1 opens, for example, when you do a "save as" on a layer and intend

SR_2 open doing a heatmap

You're probably also getting a compile error when building the core library.
The link errors are just aftereffects.

 Are they expecting you to use commercial GIS? Certainly over here in
education (degree level) the vast majority of use of the word 'GIS'
means ESRI.

 Perhaps because I was born in the 60's - but then everyone was protesting then!

 Perhaps protest is too strong a word. The English attitude would be
too timid. "Excuse me, but if its not too much trouble, and really I
don't want to bother you, is there perhaps the slightest chance we
could get this data in some other file format? You know, one that we
might actually be able to read?" This is best read out in the voice of
actor Hugh Grant, who is the exact likeness in appearance and manner
of all Englishmen.

Hi,
I'm working with PostGIS tables and noticed some problems, but I can not
tell if the problem is in QGIS or PostGIS!
For this reason I am writing to both the mailing list.

First issue:

Second:

If I use the SPIT plugin to import polygon features in PostGIS I get
this:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] More towgs84 for a single EPSG
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYoVGJ1-=MPpCgYDdzgYkrsXxE7N1S+d=3MepnVC_+iEvw@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to add new codes for Krovak/S-JTSK CRS (EPSG 5514,
5221...) especialy because users do not see those codes in WMS/WFS
dialogs. The problem is that those CRS are used in different countries
with different towgs84 params (EPSG 4836, 5239).

It seems that QGIS is not able to manage multiple different towgs84
params for the same EPSG. Current situation:
 - system tbl_srs has UNIQUE INDEX idx_srsauthid on tbl_srs(auth_name,auth_id)
 - GUI for user tbl_srs does not allow to set auth_name nor auth_id
(but it would be ignored anyway)
 - QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem - seems that authid
(auth_name:auth_id) is widely used as a unique identifier, it just
substituted former epsg:
     - used (a lot, also to store CRS in settings): authid(),
createFromOgcWmsCrs()
     - not used setAuthId()
     - not used and deprecated: createFromEpsg(), epsg(), setEpsg()

In theory we could add new 'EPSG' codes for them, but it is not good
solution because:
 - such codes would not be offered to user in WMS/WFS CRS change
dialog (and thus it does not solve the original problem)
 - possible conflicts with other projects

There is a similar ticket for 3003 and 3004 codes:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/2332

Any ideas how to solve this problem?

the problem is that QGis tries to insert a POLYGON even if the column
has a MULTIPOLYGON geometry type.

Since in this moment QGis does not use ST_Multi in the query to
convert single to multi*, the only way is to edit the column
constraint.

It seems the same problem of the one above, but in SPIT you can
change the geometry type of new features by editing the value in the
"Feature class" column.

Hi,
w/regard to the first issue, I updated my ticket here
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5109 and seems that the problem is in QGIS
master version!

I also tried your hint, but changing "feature class" column from
MULTIPOLYGON to POLYGON does not solve it!

All the best!

Message-ID: <CACbtZwQdM8AgW_Q-jMF-zEV9fFDaCA8dTwJXSHk7Pt1tE-dOWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

There have been prevoius discussions about this GSOC thing. Adding
analytical power to the software can be the best thing that can be done to
QGIS. Initially I was of the idea of porting fTools to C++, but then
realized the processing framework to be a better option. Now that there are
two frameworks on the prowl, its getting a bit difficult to draft the
proposal.

Which one is going to be adopted? And is the one that will be adopted ready
to take in a GSOC student and provide mentoring? While I have been  a
self-learner for the most part, its still a serious thing when we talk
about code going live into the project.

Or should I probably throw in the towel and pick up something like
Symbology improvements?

Directions please.

I would vote for the Framework. About deciding which of the two, I think sextante
should be more mature, therefore a better candidate, so:
- please Victor share your feelings about that
- what is the license of sextante?
- did anybody have a look to the code? any opinion about ease of integration of
additional backend, overall maintainability, etc?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

What do you mean by a downloadable file?
Can you clarify which plugin and version you have?

AFAIK, one can define as a resoualso an URI where the user can download a file. In
this case, the plugin shows a Download button.

Why are you building an old version?  1.7.4 is the current release.

Strange place to install OSGeo4W.

That's also not the current version. OSGeo4W has 1.9.

Anyway, the log doesn't tell us what the compilation error is.

Its the same dialog - it allows you to set a custom message at the top
to provide the user with some context.

Yes probably, but it shouldn't contain extracted files, unless it's also used
to install in - which I wouldn't recommend.

Hello!
If I understand correctly, then SEXTANTE more likely to stay than the

planned to work on the framework. in particular, add HPGL, my

I would add:
- who is available to mentor it full time?

In this case, as Arunmozhi pointed out, the project involves a number
of important decisions that can't be taken by the student alone.
Moreover, we need to ensure timely answers, to allow a steady developing
pace.

As it is a very interesting and much needed feature, I believe that the
student deserves appropriate support.

Arumozhi, I suggest you to also work on a backup idea, on other
QGIS/OSGeo projects. Let us know if you need guidance!

Best,

Anne

I havent used either framework much but I would comment that for me
the 'winning' framework should have have an API that others can
programme against. Ultimately the python programmer using the QGIS api
should be able to not only do simple data loading, visualisation and
gui manipulation, but should also be able to use the rich analytical
tools coming into QGIS in new and creative ways. In practice this
would probably mean that the processing framework should not be a
plugin, but rather become part of core and part of the analysis api.
Martin had some interesting ideas about fusing python mode closely
into the desktop app so it may be possible that an all python approach
could be followed.

Just my 2c

Regards

Tim

Fred,

Ah, ok, this is why I asked.  I would encourage you to file a ticket against OSGeo4W.  I will aim to upgrade the gdal-ecw package to work with the new GDAL 1.9 package (gdal).  With luck I could do this over the weekend.

With all due respect, if you had explained the problem was specifically with OSGeo4W to start I might have already had a plugin built for you.

If you find a GDAL 1.9 ECW plugin build from other sources you could drop it in:

 C:/OSGeo4W/bin/gdalplugins/1.9/

This will only work safely if the plugin is built with the same version of MSVC as GDAL 1.9 (Visual Studio 2008 in this case).

Best regards,

What symbology improvements would you be looking at doing?  There are quite a few tickets for improvements to the automatic labeling ;)

Ftools seems to have taken the limelight, but what about the idea of a suite of topology tools, which I also mentioned at the same time as the ftools idea?  It really came from Alexandre (http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2011-May/012060.html), but it's something that QGIS users often say they need to use another GIS for.
Would this also be tied up with the processing framework like the Ftools idea is?

I had thought of a MIT license, but I have included some GPLed code
from existing QGIS algorithms (from ftools and mmqgis plugins), so
those algorithms are released under GPL (I have added the
corresponding notices in the source code)

However, I selected MIT for the Java SEXTANTE code to allow for
integration in any kind of software. Since this Python version is just
developed to work with QGIS, GPL does not sound bad to me, in case the
MIT license is an issue.

Regarding ideas for improving SEXTANTE, here are two of them:

-Adding more algorithms: connecting with external apps or libraries,
or writing them directly; This is the easiest and most obvious way of
improving SEXTANTE. The Orfeo Toobox app is one of my priorities in
this, but I am sure there are many other interesting ones...
-Better data handling: Make it easier for algorithms, no matter if
they are 'native' or use an external app, to use any kind of input.
Now they have no problems with file-based data, but using data for a
DB connection or remote sensing is not that easy when you have to pass
it to an external app.

Any other question you might hAve qbout SEXTANTE, feel free to ask

Hi Fred,

Other than Frank's package (thanks Frank) was there anything else you needed to do?

I'm getting an unrecognized file type error in QGIS, despite gdalinfo --formats showing ecw on the list.

I was using the QGIS-server on a redhat as6.
Unforturnately the last commit ask me for the mssql driver.

It deny to compile without this driver.
Is this driver library downloadable somewhere for free ?

I'm available, even though there may be more effective mentors for this.
I do not know if he's available, but in case you choose sextante, Victor seems the
natural choice.
All the best.

Good to know. I think using qgis-python requires linking (importing) code to be GPL.

Message-ID: <4F7016B5.4000904@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
The number of plugins is constantly increasing, and it is getting increasingly
difficult for users to understand, from their title, what they are doing. Some of the
authors try to help writing longer titles, that are now difficult to read in the
Plugin manager.
I suggest therefore to allow for a short (Twitterable) title, and a long (README)
description. This should be visible both on http://plugins.qgis.org/ and on the
plugin manager, inside qgis.
This should be easy to implement, and will improve user experience a lot.
All the best.

Hi All,

I'd like to ask you for a vote, where to put it. I guess Database is better 
place, as the plugin operates on dbf files (and other attribute tables) and has 
nothing to do with vectors. On the other hand, for now that menu contains 
seroius databases only...

if it works like the one for gdal 1.8 then is just a connector, and you
will need the libraries from the erdas sdk (you'll need to go on their
site, register, login and download the free (gratis) sdk).

Thanks Paolo. As said before and on SoC list, the combination
"complex project" and "new student" requires a full time mentor with
experience in the area. I really look forward for potential
expert mentors to speak up.

Best,

Anne

I would suggest to use the description from the metadata description 
which is a few line.

So in QGIS: title, when you select the line, the description could 
appear at the bottom of the dialog, with a link to the website also in 
the metadata.

I don't think having the whole README in QGIS is a good idea.

Hi,

Imho, Table Manager should be in Vector menu. I'd prefer database menu to
only contain "serious" database tools for PostGIS/Spatialite/MSSQL ...

Some format to store attribute info (like dbf) is not a database for me.

Best wishes,
Anita

If the work to do is based on SEXTANTE, then I am definitely
available, and really willing to do it :-)

Well, the ecw bits on the gdal pages state that the libraries 4.1 or greater will work.

So, unless they need to be put somewhere different, the old ones should still work. 

I expect I'm wrong on this. 

-ramon.

Hallo,

UI design is a lot about user expectance
an average user visualising shape files would not expect it in 
"database" but probably neither in "vector" as it is about attributes, 
not geometries.
I am not at all familiar with the design discussion but if I would be 
free to choose from all menues I would put it in "layer" as (from a 
user's perspective) you want to do something with the active layer.

Hi Paolo,

Did not get it at first time, I'll add two digit in front... so it 
should lead to max 99'999m, should be enough. Intersecting greater 
distances seems very unlikely!

Yes, I put also this plugin for demo and as a tutorial (also, I have a 
good update procedure for the drawers...). Glad a few tested it!

Greetings,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Table manager - do you want it in Vector or

Hi,

I am wondering if it wouldn't be better to get rid of this plugin and
make sure that all of it's functionality is present in QGIS core by default?

Really this is all core functionality that a user would expect - so why
an optional plugin?

Much of the functionality is also already built into QGIS (the field
calculator, the ability to add and delete columns, the ability to export
to a different format) - what is missing what the plugin can do and QGIS
can't? Type conversions should also be possible with the field calculator.

Here is what is probably still missing:
* ability to clone columns (but you can add a column and populate it
with the field calculator)
* ability to move columns around (the order of columns)

So in my opinion, before investing too much time in this plugin I would
raster invest time to make this a QGIS core functionality.

Andreas

I think the GPL code is mandatory for the "bridge", eventually. Not all the
underlying code requires to be GPL. Am I wrong?

I did some research on this, and the conclusion is that import is functionally and
legally equivalent to linking during compilation, so everything that imports qgis
must be GPL.
All the best.

+1

I did some research as well, and came to the same conclusion.
Studies have been done (by the zope group among others), and this is the 
general final statement.

Then, I guess there is no discussion. As I said, in this case there is
no difference from my point of view, so GPL is a good option for
SEXTANTE

We need to capture this knowledge along with backlinks to original
articles as this is a topic that regularly arises. I will add it to
the governance docs if you folks can provide me with some definitive
references?

Victor, I look forward for your mentor registration! [0] Please join soc
@ lists.osgeo.org for wider discussion among OSGeo mentors and students,
and for important announcements. If you have any question, don't
hesitate to ask me or the list.

Arumozhi, feel free to continue discussing the idea with Victor and on
the list.

Best of luck with the Framework proposal!

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xR8Og=tYY-H_G=yFfAGo4NLAOPOUiRxurdr3DD12U0=A@mail.gmail.com>

I had to create a python plugin to obatin some interactions with the ESRI
ArcGIS Geoprocessing python framework. To do that, I need to import ESRI's
libraries in my plugin, which are clearly not GLP'd :)
Following a previous thread on this topic, I wonder if it's legal from the
side of QGis (obviously it is ok from the ArcGIS's side having a licence
for it).

Hi, Brylie, hi all,

OK, the ideal would be to have soon an Inkscape into composer (beautifull,
this composer !)

But I think, now, that we need to export TOC and layers into a professional
soft, as Inkscape : it is the way for my students

Because, professional map editors want (adobe) postscript files, and SVG is
an Adobe format

So, I work to contribute to SVG plugin of Richard Duivenvoorde

I?ve worked on transparencies, scales


We may work together?

Best regards

I thinkg that working to the improvement of the Composer would be an
important work. Anyway, like it happens with other GIS softwares, when you
need to refine cartographic output for professional layouts you often need
to use external softwares.

I think the two routes are both important, but they have different targets:

 

 - improve the composer, to create good quality layouts and automate map
books creations (there are a lot of things that could be refined, like
reference maps, multiple frames management, etc.)

 - work on the GDAL level (SVG or PDF) to have the most information out from
the GIS environment and obtain an unfinished product ready for higher level
graphics work.

 

I think they are complementary, and they depend on the scope of the needs.

Hi,

The first question that I had to ask myself in this thread: what is the
reason why one wants to move from QGIS to Inkscape? Are there ways to
improve QGIS so this extra step in a separate software isn't necessary any
more? Would it be more useful to implement missing features in QGIS rather
than spending a lot of time trying to let two separate software packages
talk to each other?

If you really want to work on improving the situation between QGIS and
Inkscape I think it would be best to either:

* work on SVG read/write support in GDAL (something along the lines of
http://www.carto.net/svg/utils/shp2svg/ - which is a bit outdated by now ->
the idea was to improve GDAL SVG support
* improve the qtSVG libraries so QGIS can output more semantically rich SVG
output (e.g. with layer names, text stays as text, include attribute data in
a foreign namespace so that it can be displayed in Inkscape, improve the
styling situation, etc.)

I would be interested/available to discuss options and support your work in
some ways if I can.

Let us know what you decide!

Andreas

Hi Brylie

A very good thing would be to improve the SVG export from the print
composer. In fact, this would mean to improve the SVG export in the Qt
libraries. And from this work, other Qt applications would
automatically benefit as well (a large number of applications).

Regards,
Marco

Hello,
My name is Brylie Oxley. I am a student at Sierra College in Nevada City,
CA. I would like to apply for the GSoC program.

I have been studying GIS at Sierra College, where the courses focus on
proprietary tools. For libre GIS tools to be viable options, we need high
quality cartographic tools. This is where I see Inkscape as an EXCELLENT
candidate.

I would like to make an extension for QGIS and/or Inkscape that would enable
us to send data from QGIS directly to Inkscape. It would also be nice to be
able to have Inkscape leverage the QGIS API to import data/layers into a
cartographic project.

I am glad to get any feedback regarding users' experiences sharing data
between these two programs. I would also like to know what some of the
components are that I can leverage to create a bridging extension/improved
cartographic interface for QGIS.

Thank you for your time and consideration,
Brylie Oxley

From my point of view, after researches about this specific issue, you can't 
legally :
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/19646/issues-with-osgeo-qgis-core-and-
arcpy-modules/19661#19661

GPL is a copyleft licence, therefore ?contamining? other libraries. All 
software piece which is linked to a GPL library must have a licence compatible 
with GPL.
An python ?import? is considered as a link.

I would advise you to change your software to adopt a loose coupling strategy 
between the qgis part and the esri part, either through web services, data 
exchange over a file or a database or something else not considered as a link 
in the GPL sense.

I personnaly consider that libraries should not be under a GPL licence but a 
LGPL one, which keeps the opensource aspect while facilitating mixing with 
other softwares. GPL is fine with end user software built on top of LGPL libs.
That said, it would require to relicence all qgis source code as LGPL with all 
contributors agreeing to the change.
And this is only my personal view, I do not want to start a licence troll 
thread.

+1 for making that a core functionality. New users get stuck regularly

Deleting columns already possible with GDAL >= 1.9.0
So missing only reordering functionality.

I don't think this will happen soon both for logistical reasons and
philosophical - many of us who have contributed code to the project
would object to the license switch.

Yes, now work also for me! Can anybody include this statement (SET GDAL_DRIVER_PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\gdalplugins\1.9) in  qgis-dev.tmpl and qgis.tmpl?

Thank you for good work, Joze.

if it works like the one for gdal 1.8 then is just a connector, and you will need the libraries from the erdas sdk (you'll need to go on their site, register, login and download the free (gratis) sdk).

Do you need to GPL all of SETANTE or just the glueware (e.g. QGIS plugin)? In otherwords, is there a way to keep the SEXTANTE core MIT or LGPL?

Then, I guess there is no discussion. As I said, in this case there is
no difference from my point of view, so GPL is a good option for
SEXTANTE

Well, it's for a customer, so it could be an issue...
I totally respect the choice of the developers to use a GPL license, but I
agree that an LGPL would cause lesser headaches to support
interoperability...

This is a solution that I have considered,  but it would require a lot of
overhead to do data structure exchange (python objects). I will consider
the way of cPickle or Google's protobuf.

code, but to use proprietary code through SEXTANTE...

you can import/link proprietary code into gpl code, provided you have a license to do it.

Have your customer pay the pills for those headaches / bills for those
requirements. Make them aware of how they are hurting themselves by relying
on proprietary software.

Hey all,

Anyone know why I can't assign Tamas to any tickets that are related to the
new MS SQL provider?

He created a ticket himself and is assigned to it but I can't see his name
in the list to assign him to other tickers.

I still have to sell it :) It was just a test for interoperability
management.
As usual, Sandro, it there was the chance to do everything with free
software I would have already suggested it :)

It's exactly the opposite of what you're saying on the other thread.
You're saying that it's illegal to import proprietary code into a qgis
python plugin. Have I misunderstood it?

Of course there is a way: develop what's missing (if anything).
May cost more, or may not.
For sure it doesn't bind you to a specific vendor.

Sergei, all,

I also support the integration with HPGL and ACCA.
Are you willing to work on SEXTANTE Python version as well? If so,
please coordinate with Arumozhi, so that you write two independent
proposals. There is enough work to do for two students!
I'd also ask Victor if he manages to mentor two students, maybe with
the help of co-mentors.

Best,

Anne

We always end with these conclusions, and it's a bit boring.

I totally agree with you, but reality is a bit different. Many agencies,
corporates, etc. are not considering to leave they're infrastructure. IT
ISN'T AN OPTION. I suggest solutions to interoperate, not to switch the
whole thing.

It would be easier, and a lot cheeper, if everybody talked one language.
But we have hundreads of languages in the world, and we have to deal with
this.

I apologize for my ignorance, could you explain me the differences?
You say that I cannot do an import in python to load ArcGIS code, but here
you say that I can import/link proprietary code in GPL code.I see a
contradiction here.
I apologize again if I cannot get to the point...

It is no interest of the free software users to make it any cheaper, IMHO.

People grow up learning the language of their mothers.
Nobody has to pay a license to _use_ that language.
And anyone can learn.
We're really not talking about the same thing.

I think you're right but watch the reality from a worldwide point of view.
I work mostly with foreign countries, not EU/USA. National offices and
agencies budgets are far beyond the license fees, so they don't care for it
very much. They pay yearly for something that already do the work they
need, without having to do contracts for development, define requirements,
etc.
This is the reality. In my courses, even those based on ESRI software, I
always introduce FOSS solutions. Sometimes it raises interest, most of
times they don't care. They want the job done, and they don't pay for the
license. That's it.

Anyway, if I wouldn't think that (most) of times a free solution could be
the best way, I wouldn't be here to talk about it ;)

Through the various considerations on this topic there are two positions
the seems contradictory to me:

"I did some research on this, and the conclusion is that import is
functionally and legally equivalent to linking during compilation, so
everything that imports qgis must be GPL." [1]

then

"you can import/link proprietary code into gpl code, provided you have a
license to do it."

They probably mean different things and they're not in contradiction. Being
an important point to me, could you help in understanding it?

thanks a lot,
Giovanni

Hi,
Well, this is not an easy topic, but everything is answered in the GNU FAQ on 
licences :
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html
To shorten a bit and in relation to what has been said before.

There is an exception to the GPL licence for system libraries. It does not 
apply here, as we are talking about application software.

Generally, you can link to a non-free library from a GPL code if  you deliver 
your GPL code with a specific exception for that non-free library. That means 
you have to be able to choose the licence for your code, Therefore you have to 
be the code author AND you have to be free to choose the licence. 

If your code is already part of a GPL program (say QGIS), you have to 
redistribute your code under the same GPL licence, and you cannot add such an 
exception, therefore you cannot link to this non-free library.

Of course in any (legally possible) case you want to be sure you have all the 
needed rights on the non-free library side.

Keep in mind that a Python ?import? is considered being a library link, and 
please do read the aforementionned FAQ, it contains all the necessary elements 
for you to fully understand the (difficult) matter.

Vincent

Thanks Vincent.
So, the statement "you can import/link proprietary code into gpl code,
provided you have a license to do it." should be extended with "if you add
an exception to the license", right?

So the problem is that QGis license should contain these exceptions on
behalf of all the plugins? I mean, can't I add the exception to my plugin?

No, it's a general statement, reread my post.

No. The problem is that you want to link to non-free software and you can't.
Just don't do it and you'll be fine.

I understand  that you can link proprietary code IF you add a specific
exception.
I cannot grasp the point, but I give up for now.
I will study it deeply, and ask more elucidations to a lawyer...

Take a look at the IPython parallel infrastructure:

  http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/parallel/index.html

Haven't used ArcPy, but if it is a simple matter of importing libraries
then you could fire up an IPcluster that makes the required imports. From
the QGIS side, generating tasks would be a matter of connecting to the
cluster and executing a function:

    from IPython.parallel import Client
    c = Client()

    c.apply_sync(<some function>)

IPython will handle all the pickling details for you.

That depends on how the contract was written then. If it's a work for
hire and you don't own the copyright to what you wrote but the customer
does than the GPL is only an issue if they distribute it beyond their
company.

I'm sure there's some other way to craft the whole setup, seems like a
gray area for the ecw, mrsid, oracle, mssql drivers being bridged by a
slightly different licensed piece sitting in between. Also see the
discussion on the processing framework with SEXTANTE that license
discussion appears different.

I admit a QGIS plugin that uses Arcpy sounds a little odd though...

Everything started from that. I understand it must me GPL, because it
depends on the QGis license. It follows that it won't be possible to
include proprietary algorithms within SEXTANTE, nor use it in non-free
software.

Yes, but it is focused on a specific interoperability task within a mixed
free-nonfree workflow.

Message-ID: <CA+TxYvM1Ud9+LOvYA3w--pzQVggGfQir7Nj1fnB3FW1WBEQzxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I have uploaded a new plugin "Loop Visible Layers" almost 2 weeks ago
and it is still awaiting approval.

This QGis plugin allows for layers or groups to be displayed in a loop.

The first version was approved almost immediately but it had an
installation bug so I removed that version completely.  I have
uploaded a number of improved versions and removed the experimental
flag, but no one has approved it yet.

Regards,
Etienne

Hi all.
I think we should streamline the process, to avoid disapponting our beloved plugin
devs. Suggestions?
All the best.

Ok, it's clear now Vincent.
The exception is only related to system libraries, while it doesn't apply
to code that executes inside a GPL application (which doesn't provide the
exception).

Increasing number of moderators for plugin validation?

Putting a flag "not validated yet" and making it downloadable with a 
warning?

Validated by default, then use users feedback (comments, ratings, bug 
report, malware report) ?

Might the plugin situation be a topic of the next hackfest?

There could be an option in the plugins installer, similar to that for
experimental plugins. This would allow for moderators and testers a
"sneak peek" after which the plugin could be approved or recommended
for approval.

So if you plan to distribute although technically possible to link to
a proprietary module, its not legall possible.

So if you have the license to ESRI etc. to use their libraries you are
welcome to make yourself a QGIS frontend to ArcSomething, but you cant
legally distribute that.

hello again :)
i still think in which direction i should work. it may be exactly
SEXTANTE or it may be some qgis plugins, for example: HPGL, Orfeo
toolbox (which already working via processingframework) , some
algirithms from grass (ACCA, TOAR and etc). and apparently they will
run via the SEXTANTE (it have more votes than processingframework). it
is necessary to define a list of plugins that you would like to see in
qgis?

please recall that a few weeks ago Martin Landa wrote to this list
asking if someone was working on a HPGL tool

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2012-March/018589.html

maybe he is already working on something about it.

If I understand correctly, ?????? is proposing integrating sextante
into the existing framework, not necessarily duplicating anything.

I was thinking of applying to this year's GSoC with a project to
polish the QGIS Processing Framework, specifically:

a) Address some long standing issues, like running modules in separate
threads & deciding how to handle output layers.

b) Completing support for tables, pointcloud, SAGA modules.

c) Overall a nicer interface.

In this process, things can be changed to be make it easier to
interface with Sextante or other tools.

Regards,

Camilo

Sure, that is the intention and is reflected as such in the processing
framework. (Every  Parameter type can be a
input/output/control/feedback)

The SAGA backend doesn't handle every possible combination, yet,
because either there is no need (not used by any modules) or because
there are outstanding issues (e.g. still don't know what to do if
running a module would overwrite a layer... ask the user? fail?
succeed, but create a backup?)

So, yes, you should be able to connect any output of compatible type
to any input in your module builder. E.g. the standard deviation in
Martin's example could be used as an input to some other module.

Perhaps we could at some point also create a control & arithmetics
module set to complement the module builder, I can imagine you'll
often want that stdev scaled by some amount, for example.

Camilo

Ah, Tim, it's getting clear. Thanks.
The key point is distribution, as always with GPL.
In my case I won't distribute the ESRI geoprocessing libraries, they're
part of the ArcGIS distribution, which is only availbale to users having it
installed on they're computers.

The import satement will success only if the user have the ArcGIS product
installed, otherwise it will fail. As a consequence I felt I could  freely
distribute my plugin as it doesn't strictly require the proprietary side to
run.

Doesn't GDAL do the same with ECW?! Ok GDAL are LGPL. Is this the key
difference?

Moreover it doesn't expose the QGis APIs to ArcGIS, and viceversa, so it
only bridges the two world to interchange the data.

SEXTANTE just needs to be a GPL compatible license, it does not need to
be GPL itself, though the copy distributed with QGIS will be treated as
GPL. (In effect it ends up being like a dual license).

See the diagram on http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html

I would recommend LGPL otherwise people writing the SEXTANTE plugin for
Arc might run into trouble. This would provide flexibility in what
applications can use the library (much the way gdal/ogr shows up
everywhere).

This is quite different than the other issue being discussed which is
the import of Arc into a QGIS plugin. To be clear yes people can do such
things, and could import proprietary applications into their plugins,
they just can't legally distribute it outside their company.

Thanks,
Alex

More specifically here's the compatibility list:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html

"MIT" -Expat or X11, most BSD, Apache 2, LGPL are all on the ok list.

^^^ This does not apply to plugins of QGIS which as a technical
necessity must import QGIS. It does apply to libraries that QGIS wishes
to include and import into QGIS.

Enjoy,
Alex

No you are wrong, as soon as your plugin is distributed and linked with 
arcgis, you have to licence everything as GPL and therefore provide sources.

Yes

Bridging with an import is a link. If you want to exchange data, do it without 
the import and separate your modules.

please re-read my post and mentionned the FSF faq. Everything is in there.

Exactly, indeed my plugin will be GPL, and will be distributed as it is.
How could someone argue that it's illegal? I don't ditribute non-GPL code
with it...

Ok, going through hyopthesis things are getting clear:
my plugin is ok until it doesn't load something proprietary in its process
space. As soon as it happens I must be able to provide the source of every
code running in the same process. Right?

Vincent o the other thread:
my plugin is ok until it doesn't load something proprietary in its process
space. As soon as it happens I must be able to provide the source of every

Yes, that's the right idea. Any code you import must be provided to the
end user. So to work around that you can make 2 programs.
1. QGIS plugin (GPL)
2. An Arcpy script (LGPL, MIT, BSD)

Then your Arcpy script prepares some data and writes them to files and
your QGIS Plugin is able to read those files and do something with them.
But you avoid direct import.

Seems quirky but legal.

Right.
Importing esri python module falls into that category.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposal: QGIS Processing Framework improvements
Message-ID: <CAA5P-m34FFpER9OZs4regZ9YPOEMELx6BYNbpobLRB8fZS_rvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
as you may know (or not), I participated in last year's GSoC with
Quantum GIS, creating a "Processing Framework", that allows the user
access to data analysis tools from the GIS UI:

http://polymeris.github.com/qgis/

The focus last year was on the general framework & SAGA support. This
was very well received, and we saw the addition of Orfeo as a backend.
There are also plans to add support to further libraries & to create a
"module workflow builder", a graphical interface to the interaction
capabilities provided by the framework.

The experience was very rewarding, so I'd like to apply again this
year, with a project to improve on last year's work, adding
multithreaded support, UI improvements & SAGA support for the
remaining modules.

The full proposal can be seen at the GSoC page:

http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/polymeris/11002

Any comments are very welcome.

Regards,
Camilo

Not everyone uses 1.9 yet. Because of its unavailability in some distros and 
because of the problems with dbf encoding. Furthermore, I use 1.9.0 and the 
delete field button is still grayed out (I have no time to investigate this 
issue now). So I believe this functionality in Table Manager may be still 
useful over next few months.

In short, it seems TableManager can stay in the Plugins menu to not confuse 
users and wait for its natural death.

Perfect. I find thinking in the terms of process space a clear criterior.
This makes dynamic and static linking equivalent...

So, going back to SEXTANTE, it can be given an LGPL license but it cannot
use non-free code when used through Qgis, while it's free to do it when
used through, e.g., ArcGIS.
Please, tell me it's right, otherwise I end the day with another doubt! :)

You've done a great work Camilo, and obviously it's always a good thing
having multiple approaches to the things, because it can be a richness. I
only wonder if those working on such frameworks could converge to a common
effort, somehow.

Probably you and Victor will desire to follow your own routes. In that case
I hope the best results to both: we will have the opportunity to chose the
best fitting solution ;)

GPL + LGPL = OK

    eg. QGIS + SEXTANTE = OK

QGIS + SEXTANTE + your code (GPL or LGPL) = OK


LGPL, MIT, BSD + Proprietory  = OK

   e.g. SEXTANTE + Arcgis = OK

       Spatialite library + iOS = OK.

GPL + Proprietory = ?

    e.g. QGIS + ArcGIS = ?

However,

QGIS + QGIS plugin (GPL) + Arcpy script (LGPL, MIT, BSD) = might be OK.

QGIS + QGIS plugin (GPL) <-> data <-> Arcpy script (LGPL, MIT, BSD)

Yes it's ok as long as they don't directly import each other.

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GSoC Ideas
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFcMP-3-PJv+cUc0OPLXZ1=NRAAeAuSzf-HVyhPCczN5Bw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

since this year's GSoC has just opened for student applications, I
have taken the liberty to add some more ideas and reorganize our page
with ideas [1]. If you have more ideas then hurry to add them ASAP,
wannabe applicants are already browsing the lists.

Some ideas still look like early drafts - I encourage the people to
add some more information/introduction there - students reading the
ideas will skip them if they do not understand the purpose. Ideas
pages of other organizations may be a good source of inspiration how
idea description should look like.

I am not sure whether to keep the processing framework ideas given the
recent news about sextante port to QGIS being in works... anyone has
an opinion on that?

Message-ID: <1332803088.2195.20.camel@sibirica>

Dear Pavol,

I recently give a qgis training course and I wanted to just let  you
know that a trainee with QGIS on OsX was not able to use your plugin on
her Mac. Selecting the plugin icon seemed to have no effect as the
previously selected tool was not unselected.

Cheers

Message-ID: <1332804199.2195.26.camel@sibirica>

Hi Stefan,

it seems that mapbook printing on Windows with easy print is not
working. Can you confirm?

Where I have no problems on Linux, with the same layer on Windows it
seems to output just the first pdf and then it hangs.

On Windows I also see sometimes pyhton error (like the one below) that I
can't see on linux.

thanks in advance

Since QGIS includes a server application now, perhaps you should consider relicensing under the *more* restrictive AGPL ;)

Does anyone know about distributing *only source code* as *public domain* for a plugin which links with proprietary software?
I think it would not be allowed, but I'm not sure.

Yes, I wonder about that too. I don't haven't really figured out how
sextante works, but it seems a very different approach: calls backends
through the commandline, which makes it much simpler to implement, of
course, but also limited in some aspects: no interaction, only batch
based jobs. I might be wrong, though.

I guess "friendly competition" has its advantages, too.

I have noticed recently that the outline for the selected polygon is
slightly shifted from the actual polygon, perhaps this is related?

Hi,

The idea "All-in-one Projects" is not the best one. The main issues:

1. Licensing of the included maps.
2. Use of the web services.
3. Huge data files.

It is up to user how he/she will handle licensing. Please note that
all-in-one projects would basically do the same thing what users
already manually do (e.g. when providing data for bug reports), the
only difference is that it would be automatic.

> 2. Use of the web services.

What particular issues do you see here? Layers from web services could
be either just linked (not included) or when it is easy to download
the data then they could be included.

> 3. Huge data files.

This is up to common sense of the users.

I premit that I've already chosen a solution to bypass these issues: one,
common library and two plugins, one for qgis and one for arcpy. The plugins
will interact through pickling, sharing a common data structure from the
common library. This is the easiest solution for me to deploy (no servers
as with iPython or RabbitMQ).

So, at the end, QGis + GPL + proprietary = illegal.

But what about QGis + GPL + LGPL + proprietary?

It's not a perversion, it's something that we already have:

fTool + GDAL python bindings + ECW

Hi Martin.
I think it is really important and urgent to analyze the issue, an take a decision.
Could anybody inspect the code, and help us taking an informed decision?
Of course, having com-mentored Camilo's work, I'm a bit partial in keeping on the 
good work on the Processing Framework, but sextante seems a more mature solution.
On the other hand, analytical tools receive typically less attention (i.e. funding) 
than other tools of more general use, so it may be dangerous to try and keep both 
approaches, as we can run short of manpower.
Camilo, would you be interested in applying for sextante, bringing your experience in?
Victor, could you add quickly your proposal for sextante?
Thanks to all.

Calling algorithms from SEXTANTE doesn't have to be done through the
command line. In fact, the idea behind SEXTANTE is to make it as easy
as possible to create your own algorithms, and that might be writing
it directly in Python, calling a 3rd party app on the console, or
doing it through a Python binding

Of course, but it would also be great to join platforms or at least
improve one based on the other. I will be at Lyon for the developers
meeting (looking forward to it!!): Any chance that you might attend
the meeting as well??

Hi Giovanni
as others suggested, you can not use arcpy for
writing a QGIS plugin, if you are willing to deploy it as open source
(ie it is not for your company internal use). QGIS plugins must be
released as GPL.
Are you considering to release your solution for the community? If not
- as I think - you do not need to bother ;)

same here, if you are willing to open your code to the community.
For the same reason GDAL packages are not built with ecw support (same
for file gdb, arcsde ecc ecc), but you must compile it for yourself if
you need it.

Paolo

I have just registered as mentor and sent a small mesage to the GSoC
OSGeo. If there is any other thing I can do, just tell me.

I am a bit busy this week, and stil wnat to work on SEXTANTE to
release is ASAP, but the idea of participating in GSoC sounds great to
me :))

QGis (GPL) + GPL + LGPL + proprietary = illegal.

Any proprietary code added to GPL is illegal. Unless they re license
the code as LGPL.

Paolo, if I'm asking the questions is not for bothering. It's something
important to me, both as a developer and a cunsoltor for my customers.
If you fell this is not the right place to ask it, I will move to the FSF
forums or the italian ASSOLI.

In osgeo4w the gdal-ecw DLLs are released binary compiled. I never needed
to compile them by myself. Are you saying that osgeo4w is doing something
incorrect?

Ops. How QGis can use GDAL which uses ECW?!

1 - GDAL is LGPL
2 - it's imported by QGis, so it doesn't use QGis but is used by...
3 - osgeo4w bundles gdal-ecw DLL

I think there are no erdas libraries in the gdal-ecw package, it is just
a "bridge" (sorry if it is not the right term) between gdal and the
erdas libraries that the user must get and copy manually in his system.

Exactly, the same would happen with an LGPL bridge to ArcPy ;)

*Forget Qgis for a moment*
I create an LGPL library on top of arcpy. Stop

Then, I release a GPL plugin for QGis that can import and use the above
LGPL library.
QGis + GPL imports an LGPL library and ONLY USE ITS CODE. The GPL doesn't
import arcpy, nor use any proprietary code.

Hi Victor,

did you register on Melange? I don't see your request for mentoring
there, and it's a mandatory step for GSoC participation. See here for

Hi Alexander

 From my side it is not planned (though I see that it can be useful).
What kind of use case do you have in mind?

Hi all,

I'm wondering why the MsSql provider cannot be disabled in cmake to
be not compiled, like instead the PostGis and SpatiaLite ones can be.

Maybe there's a good reason, but I don't get it at the moment.

I did register at Melange, following all the steps in that link that
you sent. Maybe there is a bit of delay?? If it is not working, tell
me and I will register again (if i can do it...)

Message-ID: <CAA6k8-Jw-Up3uOgCVYYxuvsVH8kavP1CpqWPNcUMtnqYv5VxyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Tim, list,

two weeks ago I made a pull request to improve context help for
actions. I added some lines to explain how expressions in actions work
and also the "search string on web" example.
I do not pushed it because I'm waiting somebody checks my (bad) english.

In addition, I think that adding a button "Default actions" (like default
servers in WMS) can help to understand how actions works, maybe
we could move examples there.

Comments are welcome.
Regards.

I think the question you have to ask here is this: does your plugin require
arcpy to function properly (whether via a bridge or not)? If it doesn't
work without it, then its a derivative work*... and since it obviously
doesn't work without pyqgis, which is gpl, it can't legally be released as
is.

Hi Marco,

I'd like to see new-symbology/SLD support in qgis-server, but I think
would be better to move the SLD code to a new class before doing it,

something like Sld2symbologyV2Conversion class or even into the
existent QgsSymbologyV2Conversion class.

Did you have a look at the code? Do you think the same or it can stay
there?

Regards.

The gdal/ecw case is particularly complex, as the ECW licence changes 
regularly and is some kind of opensource but not really.

As for YOUR specific case, I think you should have understood by now that it's 
not possible to use Arcgis inside a python plugin, whatever the energy you 
deploy to try to convince the world to the opposite.
The only exception to that would be to have a python plugin which is _not 
dependant_ on arcgis (which means arcgis is completely optional), and which 
communicate with another process. The latter can use arcgis, can be free or 
non-free, but must _not_ import any GPL code and _must_ do data exchange 
through a non contaminating method : file, database, webservice_

I think you can't do it for SQLanywhere either.

I assume it's because you don't need a library to use it.

PostgreSQL and SpatiaLite (can) have external dependencies, MSSQL apparently
doesn't (at least not directly) - same for SQL Anywhere.

So maybe it doesn't make sense to have the option to disable it then.  I'm
happy to leave it on no one has any issues with that.

I think I saw that a couple of time in this thread already. GDAL is not LGPL,
it is X/MIT.  More relaxed - you can do just about anything with it - including
using it in closed proprietary stuff like ArcGIS.

I don't want to convince anyone vincent :)
I'm just exploring the various corner cases to understand precisely what
can be done and what not.
It simply sounds strange to me that, somehow, ECW closed source code can
arrive into the QGis process space. It means there's a hole somewhere. Ok,
ECW releases the headers as open source, but the underlying SDK algorithms
and data structures aren't.
It follows that SOMEHOW some proprietary code can "infect" the purity of
the QGis process.
You can give me all the reasons, but I suppose that if it happens for ECW
it can be reproduced, SOMEHOW, for anything else.

For my plugin I already have decided what to do. This is a general question
now. If a Qgis user can leavarage a proprietary algorithm (ECW), anyway it
happens, it can happen again :)

It would be cool to also embed the GRASS toolbox in the framework.
Since GRASS is already integrated in Sextante (in a very elegant way,
the user does not need to know anything about locations, all done
automatically), it would be nice to see this also in QGIS.

+1 from me on this if it's possible.. I always see the "create Location" 
as the big "entry point problem" for GRASS.

I've seen it several times from friends that they are mostly not willing 
to read some manuals - everyone wants that it just works .. (Don't blame 
me for that - I am just telling what I have seen).
It would be nice to have GRASS tools integrated in a way that you don't 
have to deal with locations.. And there will always be the option to 
switch to GRASS if you have to dig deeper .. :)

kind regards
Werner

Cool! So this would be this chain:

QGIS <--> framework <--> sextante <--> GRASS

Well, AFAICT  it is:

QGis <-> plugin <-> SEXTANTE (this is the "framework") <-> GRASS

Markus,

GRASS is integrated in SEXTANTE for QGIS just like it is in the Java
version of SEXTANTE (with some slight improvements that I am
doing...). However, I started the integration with SAGA and R before,
and those are now available from SEXTANTE, since more or less they
work fine, but GRASS is still unfinished and I have preferred to
deactivate it by now until it is finished, so you will not see it in
the list of available algorithms (I prefer not to confuse early
testers with things that are not yet working properly...). However, I
am currently working on that and you will have it soon ready

You opinion on this is more than welcome, as it was when I was
developing the GRASS-SEXTANTE connection for the Java version

And as Giovanni said, SEXTANTE is the framework, so you will have
GRASS tools also in other elements like the graphical modeler, the
batch processing interface, the Python console, etc

Hi Giuseppe

Yes, it would be great to move QGIS server to the built-in SLD support.

>Did you have a look at the code? Do you think the same or it can stay
>there?

To use the new SLD code in QGIS server, I think it is enough to use 
QgsFeatureRendererV2::loadSld in QgsSLDParser::rendererFromUserStyle 
(without the need for rearrangements in symbologyV2). Then 
QgsSLDRenderer & co. in the server can be removed.

Regards,
Marco

Hi all.
So it seems that all the plugins are inactive by default. This makes sense, as it 
presents a cleaner interface to a newbie, but it makes difficult to find what is 
perceived as an hidden command.
Are we sure this is the best option?
All the best.

Usually we had some registry settings we applied using nsis that
enabled plugins, arranged toolbars etc. I  don't know what the
procedure is with osgeo4w.

This is also an irriation. Maybe in this case we should look for a
programmatic solution so its there by default on all platforms.

I guess with OSGeo4W you can install just GDAL (and gdal-ecw) and it will be under the MIT license.
If you install GDAL and QGIS they must be under the GPL.
So in theory you shouldn't be able to install all three?  It doesn't really seem to work... perhaps this demonstrates an inherent problem with the whole system of software licensing.

The "new" read-only ECW dlls that are distributed in the QGIS Windows installer are not at all open source.  Paolo said something not long ago about needing to talk to Erdas to clarify the situation, as apparently at one stage they granted special permission to redistribute them with QGIS.  But I'm pretty sure after this conversation that they are *not* redistributable with QGIS.  The license on the "new" dlls has changed at least once, but I don't see how it could affect this conversation, as it has never been GPL compatible.

The "old" read-write ECW libs that are typically used on linux can supposedly be distributed with GPL software, so I think it would make sense to use them also on Windows (especially since they are read-write).

I am pretty confident as well that at least distribution of the ECW dll is not 
permitted. It's probably even worst than that, as I am not sure that even 
linking QGIS-GDAL-ECW is legally doable. A clear statement would need some 
thorough investigation though.
Frank probably has some further thought on this point.

Right, but no idea of the technical difficulty there.

Hi

I have uploaded a plugin to the contributed repo but I would like to update
it.

I can't see any way to update or remove the original plugin even when I am
logged on?

Sorry if I am being an idiot.

Tom

Actually, Frank tried to address this in the following RFC :
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc34_license_policy . It went to the discussion
stage (there is a thread somewhere on gdal-dev) but not further. It is not clear
where the responsibility belongs to. Likely not at the level of each individual
project, but more at the level of the packaging system (OSGeo4W for example). In
practice, the problem can come only if one of the copyright holders of QGIS
wants to exercice his rights given by the GPL.

I believe that Tamas Szekeres in his daily builds at
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/ uses the 3.3 SDK under Windows.

Hi all

I have tried to upload my SEXTANTE plugin to the plugin repository,
but it says that it is too big (it has around 1.5 MB). Any solution to
this? Otherwise, I will just put the zip file in the SEXTANTE website,
but that is not such a good solution, I guess.

Regqards and thanks in advance

SVG is a World Wide Web Consortium standard.

Adobe and other private corporations (ESRI, Microsoft, etc.) are 
occupying our educational institutions and I refuse to support them. 
This project is intended to build on and integrate excellent tools as an 
/alternative/ to closed source tools that privatize wealth/mind share 
and are the current norm.

Inkscape is a viable tool and deserves consideration and promotion.

I would very much appreciate working with you Fred. :-) We should, 
perhaps, start a public wiki page regarding this project, on the OSGeo

Message-ID: <CACbtZwQduGW3tanRLqPAB59aSnPmqO9=NugWTe5vLX23u+og-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Alexander and Martin,

After a number of discussions about the idea to pursue for the for GSOC, I
think the analytical framework plugin would be better taken care of,
primarily since Polymeris returning this year to continue from where he
left, I think its better I move on to something else.

I have been going through the ideas in the ideas page and the feature
tickets dealing with the symbology and think I can work in that area. Since
both of you have proposed (and improved) that idea, I am writing to ask if
I can go on with the idea for the proposal.

I have already written C++ code for QGIS and hence have a general
understanding of how the code has to be written, however I must admit, I
have no experience on the symbology front, but would start reading the
code. With your mentoring I think I can accomplish what you have in mind.

Victor,

Are you talking about plugins.qgis.org? We can change that limit for
you. I'll look into it later today.

Brylie,

Please also contact the Inkscape team to let them know about the idea
and see if anyone from their team could co-mentor the project.

I'm also interested to extend Inkscape with a tag editor for SVG that
makes it easier to catalog icons made in Inkscape in the proposed tool
in QGIS.

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsPythonRunner and multiline command
Message-ID: <CAA6k8-J6THXJ1UpNYXSqHaGG-sTzCGzpd2KZST0RcE6kjtBicg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm seeing that QgsPythonRunner executes all the commands in
"single mode" (just one row at one time), instead IMHO would be
useful to have it working in "file mode" (executing multiple lines).

There are things that cannot be done in single line mode (e.g
try-catch statements). This behavior can be a strict constraint
while defining feature actions.

Is there a reason to have it working in a such manner?
Regards.

Looks like the default is set in validator.py

PLUGIN_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE= getattr(settings, 'PLUGIN_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE', 1048576)

appears override-able in the local_settings.py if I understand the 
getattr function.

Tim or other admins have an idea of the best place to make the change? 
What should we set the new limit to? 5 MB?

Thanks,
Alex

I have moderation rights, only used twice, because it is not clear what 
responsibilities are (and to be honest others did already approve it).
I do get a mail when somebody asks for approval, but NOT when it is 
approved (eg by one of the other moderators) -> feature request?

Besides this, it's often not very clear what a plugin is supposed to do, 
or how to test. I do not have time enough to do a thorough scan of the 
code for malicous stuff or find out if it is working as it suppossed to be.

What about the idea of forcing a plugin-creator to write a wiki-page 
with the information what the plugin is supposed to to AND some test 
directions (preferebly with some downloadable code).
This would make it for moderators much easier to do some small tests (eg 
I'm not so much into rasters, I need real guidance when you want me to 
test raster-analysis plugins...).

This way would also 'force' plugin devs to create some quality around it.
In my vision a plugin should not only be uploaded 'to the community' 
just because you think you solved your problem, but also because you 
want others to use it (and want to invest some time in guiding others to 
use it).

Richard Duivenvoorde

This matches my proposal to make mandatory to add some lengthy description of the 
plugin. IMHO it is better to have it inside the plugin, rather than as an external 
resource, and display it in the plugin page on http://plugins.qgis.org
Also, it would be useful to have sample data to reproduce the plugins functions, when 
appropriate.
All the best.

I agree on this.
As you write, "creating quality around the plugin" should almost be 
mandatory.

Also, right now, it is not very clear for plugin devs to know how to 
create this quality. I mean that the plugin help page leads the dev to 
the QGIS hub, and I think it is really not the right way to go. Github 
offers a better wiki, issues tracking, browsing source code.

I tried for a while to use the hub to present my plugins, but I went 
back on github as it is far more fancy to present the plugins.

I also try to do a video demo, this could also be suggested to the dev.

rst seems particularly appropriate, as we paln to mode our docs to it, and add 
multiligual support

Nice idea, Nathan ;)
we could then auto-generate an html documentation page for each plugin
(for example with rst2html), linking to this page from the plugin
page, and maybe include a plugin section in the user guide (maybe as
an appendix), including these plugins documentation pages.

+1

I suggest a higher upload limit: maybe 10-15 MB?

I just deployed and zipped the plugin I'm currently working on, and it
is close to 5 MB. I have many documentation pages to go; so, I don't
doubt my plugin will be over 5 MB when released as a ZIP archive. It
will also be an alpha version with more features being added later.

As plugin devs attempt more complex plugins, the upload size should
not be a hindrance. Also, if the size could be saved with the plugin
data on plugins.qgis.org, then it could be displayed there and
possibly in the Plugin Installer. This way a user could decide if they
want to download based on that info. In my opinion, 10-15 MB is not
that large a download these days.

Thanks to the moderator who approved my plugin today.

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/loopvisiblelayers/

However, I have 2 issues:

1) How can I register my project as a sub-project of
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins ?

There is no "New project" link on that page, but the main projects
page has one (which would create a top-level project).


2) The latest approved version (0.3.1) was accidentally uploaded as
"Experimental" (I guess I didn't pay attention), and when I removed
that flag the plugin has been flagged as unapproved - is this intended
behavior?
Can someone please re-approve it?

regards,
Etienne

local_settings.py is the way to go.

+1 for reStructedText

As a new plugin developer with many documentation pages to write, it
was fortuitous when I saw Tim's post about Sphinx's support for using
gettext to produce .po files that can be translated in Qt Linguist. I
was struggling with the idea of how to localize my documentation; but
being my plugin is Python-based, Sphinx, with eventual Linguist
support, turned out to be the clear choice. Has anyone actually tried
this approach yet?

I also use GitHub and like it's .rst support for displaying READMEs.

+1 for that type of support on hub/plugins.qgis.org as well.


On a simmilar note. What about 1-3 screen shots as 8-bit pngs,
restricted within some pixel area (like 1024 x 1024)? They could have
a standard naming convention like: screen_1.png -> screen_3.png. I
think this would also help users to 'see' plugins with GUIs, prior to
installation. Could be on hub/plugins.qgis.org, and supported in
Installer as well.

I've bumped the limit to 10Mb in settings_local.py. No idea if it works though :)

Multiline python support in actions would be nice - though as a work
around I guess you can import a module and execute a function in it
passing action params to it.

Unlikely... am too far away. :(
What I can gather from this discussion is that the framework is
redundant, sextante seems the way to go, more mature and more
straightforward design (from what I can tell). If you agree, I'll
withdraw my proposal and see if there is anything I can do to improve
on sextante. (Through GSoC or otherwise)
Pehaps some of the things (code or ideas) developed for the framework
can be reused, and if not... at least it was a learning experience.

Sure, you are welcome to pick that idea for a proposal.

Therefore I would recommend you to play a bit with QGIS new symbology
from user's point of view - with renderers, symbols, symbol layers,
styles. That should give you an idea of the current state of vector
symbology - from there you could proceed with writing a proposal,
stating more precisely what things would you like to improve.

And remember that what is in the wiki page is just a bunch of ideas -
you are free to use those or come up with different ones! As you
already mentioned, the bug tracking system is also a valuable source
of ideas. Good luck with your proposal and if you have any
questions/ideas do not hesitate to write to qgis-dev list.

Regards
Martin

That's a possible work around, but creating a new file is very
annoying when you want to write only few lines of code.
In addition a user can find difficulty in loading a module,
especially if they don't know how to correctly setup python to
find their modules.

Obviously using python in actions requires some knowledge (e.g.
to know python syntax), but users usually search and adapt a
working script.

Sometimes puts more python commands in just one line of
code can require more skills than compile QGis on Windows
w/o getting dependencies from OSGeo4W :)

Cheers!

I think, at least modular architecture and distributing backends as
separate plugins can be reused. Not SEXTANTE is one large plugin
with all interfaces included in it.

Just my 2 cents

I agree with Martin, playing a bit with symbology as user helps to understand
better current state and areas that needs improvements.

It would be really awesome to give the New symbology gui a complete
overhaul to a tree based paradigm where nodes are

symbol
  + symbol layer (simple)
  + symbol layer (complex)
    + symbol layer (simple)
    + symbol layer (simple)
   + symbol layer (complex)
    + symbol layer (simple)
    + symbol layer (simple)

With the grand aspiration of no popups, no deep diving through dialogs
to find that one symbol layer you are after.

Tim

Hi all.
Until recently, donations were relatively infrequent, so their management could be 
done by hand. For each donation, I personally added the name on the donors page, and 
sent an email to the donor, thanking him for his/her contribution.
Now things are going faster, and this approach is proving impractical. I think we 
should automatize it. A nice example (thanks Robert Nuske for pointing it out) is:
http://documentfreedom.org/donate/
Is there anybody willing to set up a similar application? I imagine Joomla should 
have modules ready for this.
All the best.

It would be nicer to add it as a wish for django since it is not clear
how long we will persist with joomla in the long run.

How about adding it here:

agreed - however, the app looks a bit complex, especially because it links to 
payment; are we sure we want to reinvent the wheel?

There is probably a django app out there that we could use that does
something similar. I'll have a look when I have a minute or maybe Ale

Hi
looks like there are plenty of payments app for django [0]
I think the question is do we want to keep only paypal or add more 
possibilities?

as well, we could have a look in just simply configure paypal to send 
out a mail and add a name to the donor list. shoud be as simple as 
adding a small php file somewhere on our server.

ciao
Marco

I would prefer to have different forms of payment, as PP is quite expensive, and 
several people do not like it.

Thanks.

that is true, but handling CreditCards is not cheap either Plus you have 
to deal with CC audits, liability and so on if you want to implement all

then maybe the idea of a donate page with all the information and the PP 
link is the best one.
But bank account transfers will be very hard to handle automatically. 
You kind of need an API or a payment notification from the bank.

Are we a IRS-certified 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations based in the 
US? or could we be one?

pretty interesting comparisons [0][1]

PP seems to me in line with pricing, even on the lower end.

I just recalled a presentation at FOSSGIS where Arnulf Christl sayd that 
even OSGeo dropped the idea of becoming one.

I'll use it, but only as a last resort. I don't have an account, and am quite suspicious about signing up given the amount of emails I get trying to tell me that an account that I don't have needs a new password/revalidating/whatever. 
 
That said, it does seem well regarded and quite popular.

Hi devs,

I have made a few pull requests over on github for nice additions and
fixes to legend and browser dock, gdal and ogr providers as well as
ftools.

Most of it is pretty straightforward (except for the .zip file support
in #109) and it would be great to see in 1.8.

Can this be looked at before the imminent feature freeze?

Regards,
Etienne

Yes I have seen your pull requests - I or others will go through all
pending requests before announcing the freeze.

The board has decided to change to pursuing a 501(c)(6) status which is
a business/trade organization. So as for donations, they are not tax
exempt in the US.

The latest discussion on the topic at the board was that it was not the
norm in GSOC amongst projects to distribute mentor funds directly to
mentors. That said the board does intend to spend the money from GSOC on
projects - meaning QGIS can make requests for some of those funds to be
spent on QGIS' behalf or transferred to a QGIS org account. They just
wanted to avoid the overhead of cutting checks and tax paperwork to many
people.

So, if we need $ for something like a code sprint OSGeo is willing to
put up some. Might be a good way to entice matching funds...

Thanks,
Alex

Thanks Alex.
So, it would be good to use some of the last year mentor funds to support the 
upcoming HF. Whom should we ask?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SEXTANTE for QGIS has been released
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7yNf-omm9N9UXJmnHhx5BCeRzfjSO6fJUL5JijiP7yDww@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am glad to announce that a first (tagged as 'experimental') version
SEXTANTE for QGIS has been released. It includes, among other things:

-Full support for SAGA algorithms
-ftool(vector processes) and mmqgis algorithms (these are not only
added to be used directly, but also as real examples of how to create
new algorithms or migrate existing ones into the SEXTANTE platform)
-Support for user-defined R scripts
-Support for user defined Python scripts
-Graphical modeler
-Batch processing interface
-History

You can download it using the QGIS plugin installer

Please, read the manual before using the plugin. You can access it
selecting the "SEXTANTE help" option in the SEXTANTE menu.

This version is still missing some functionalities, but should be
fully usable. Users should be particularly aware of the following
issues:

-External applications (SAGA and R) have been tested mostly on
Windows, but not so much in Linux, so problems might appear on that
platform. No testing has been done at all under Mac OS.
-GRASS algorithms have been deactivated, in order to have a working
version as soon as possible. We hope to have GRASS incorporated into
the set of available algorithms pretty soon
-Although most algorithms support multiple formats for their ouput
layers, these are currently limited to tiff for raster layers,
shapefiles for vector layers and dbf files for tables. This can be
changed easily and will be done in a next version
-Calling external applications might not work if using layers such as
those coming from remote services or DB connections. Please, use just
file-based data by now (we are working on improving that as well, but
it might take time... ;-) )
-Using tables (and also opening those generated by geoalgorithms) is
still a bit in development, since there is no built-in default method
of opening independent tables. By now, attribute tables of vector
layers can be used, but only if these are in shapefile format (since
we can refer to the associated dbf file). We expect to change this
soon, probably creating some plugin to improve that handling of
independent tables (or if anyone can point us to an existing one that
can be coupled with SEXTANTE, that good be even better...)

Once again, read the manual before trying it, as it will greatly help
you to understand SEXTANTE and what you can do with it.

For developers: I know a lot of documentation is needed...hope to have
that solved soon (or at least start to solve it). A SEXTANTE for QGIS
developers manual is also on its way... there is already a mechanism
to create QGIS plugins that register new algorithms in SEXTANTE
(thanks to Alexander Bruy for the suggestion!), but still has to be
documented. I am currently working on an well documented example case,
to be released soon as well

Of course, all bug reports and comments are welcome, since this is
still a beta version.

Thanks in advance for your interest.

Hi Victor.
Thanks a lot for this, now testing it.
Could you please open a project here?
http://hub.qgis.org/projects
I see the bugtracker is currently under:
http://gvsigce.sourceforge.net/mantis/main_page.php
Do you plan to move it sooner or later?
All the best.

Hi Victor.
Testing on Debian. I hope not to generate too much noise.
First issues:
- paths to SAGA etc. are not taken from the system, and must be added by hand - this 
should be made automatic
- running a command results in:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "/home/paolo/.qgis/python/plugins/sextante/gui/ParametersDialog.py", line

Similar, for R:

IOError: [Errno 2] File o directory non esistente:

In fact, the file is not there.

Please let me know how you prefer to deal with these reports (a message here, a 
ticket on the trac, silence? ;) ).

All the best.

 Hi,

 The City of Dornbirn and the Province of Vorarlberg have an interest in 
 getting an Oracle Spatial native driver developed for QGIS. They would 
 finance the bulk of the development, but they are interested in other 
 financial contributions if there are other interested commercial or 
 governmental QGIS users with an interest in the access of Oracle 
 databases.

 Please contact me if you have an interest in helping this project 
 financially. We are not interested in small donations but in more 
 substantial amounts in order not to complicate the billing process too 
 much.

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Can you give some idea of how much the funding shortfall is and what
the minimum contribution should be? There were some people here in
South Africa interested in Oracle support who I will pass the
opportunity on to.

Yes I confirm for QGIS master.
I tested with a postgres and a raster layer, and bug occurs with both.

It's not to feed the troll, but be sure to read the other threads regarding 
the GPL and linking problems. There _may_ be some legal implications 
concerning such a development, be sure to get them identified before starting 
development.

Paolo

Thanks for the report

As I mentioned, I have done very little testing on linux

When calling SAGA or R on linux, the path to the software is not
needed, since it assumes they are on PATH already. I will remove that
setting and the warning in case it is running on linux ( do not know
why I haven't done that before...)

The problem you have with saga seems to be before calling saga itself,
since the batch file cannot be created (well, it seems that it denies
per,ission to create it... but then creates it...)

The R one, instead, is after R is called, but it seems that the call
is not working properly and it is missing the R console output file.

Let me do some more linux testing and try to fix that...

Maybe it is better to add bug reports to the issue tracker in our
googlecode website

http://code.google.com/p/sextante/issues/list

We use a different one for the Java version, but I guess it is a good
idea to keep them separate, so you can put things there

Regards, and thanks again!

Victor

currently however it is necessary, because the paths are not found, can

ok, please note however that an user will go to the official sextante 
website, and from there it will be directed to the bugtracker for java, 
so this wil cause confusion.
glad you decided to open a bugtracker on hub.qgis.org, it will make 
things easier. Please let us know, I'll fill tickets there.

Thanks a lot.

Yes it would be good to research this. We may also amend the license
to make a special linking exception for this case if we decide it is
in our best interests. Or maybe there is some free oracle library like
FreeTDS for MSSSQL?

Sorry, I was wrong, the path is needed, because it is added then to
PATH in the batch file. The R call does not use one, since it passes
the batch process to R directly, and assumes R to be on the PATH...

Yes, I have to update the official website as well... This release has
been a bit rushed :)

For now, let's use the hub.qgis.org tracker that I have just created.
By the way, I created the project but it appears not within the User
Contributed Plugins group, but outside. I cannot find the way to put
it there, but I guess it should be on that level. Otherwise it might
seem more relevant than what it really is :))

Simon Greener has GeoRaptor - Oracle. It is GPL. I think this can be
use for creating the driver, if I am not mistaken.

http://www.spatialdbadvisor.com/

GeoRaptor is an extension for Oracle SQL Developer viewing and
maintaining Spatial data. It is a true Open Source project started in
2006. The name was inspired by SQL Developer's prerelease name
"Raptor" and was left unchanged after product launch of SQL Developer

That's would require all authors to agree on that, wouldn't it?

Anyway, the MSSQL provider uses QODBC and the Oracle provider could do the
same.  So we wouldn't need to directly link or ship anything from Oracle.

Hi All, 
very interested in such a feature too!

If you do it, don't forget to offer an access to attribute tables (non SDO
ones) . many users just open a geographical table and a attribute table, and
join them to map datas..

should be fixed in the next necessitas release

Hi Marco,

  Do you have any idea how I can get QGIS on Android full-screen without
  the Android Statusbar on the top? My problem is that some dialogues
  (e.g. the layers properties dialogues) are still cut off at the bottom
  and I cannot reach the OK/Cancel buttons - which means that I have to
  force-quit QGIS.

  The situation is improving constantly, but still there are some
  dialogues with such problems. If I had the extra space from the top
  Android status bar I think I'd have a chance to reach those OK/cancel
  buttons ...

  Thanks if you have any idea.

  Andreas

What about moving the founding to improve the Oracle driver inside GDAL?
The OCI driver would need some refactoring, as it was stated time ago by
Frank.

This would provide a benefit also to the other sw using GDAL/OGR, and would
solve the problem of the license (I suppose)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin snippets & cookbook
Message-ID: <4F758385.1010207@gmail.com>

Hi all,

First, I propose to add these three lines in the code snippets. It is to 
include help link in thew plugin menu:
def initGui(self):
   # This initiates the action
   self.helpAction = QAction(QIcon(":/plugins/myplugin/icons/help.png"), 
"Help", self.iface.mainWindow())
   # This will open the website url using user's defined browser
   QObject.connect(self.helpAction, SIGNAL("triggered()"), lambda: 
QDesktopServices.openUrl(QUrl("http://my.help.site/formyplugin")))
   # This will add the help link in the plugin menu, under the entry "My 
Plugin"
   self.iface.addPluginToMenu("&My plugin", self.helpAction)


What do you think?
Can someone add this or tell me how to do it?


Also, if I'd like to share a few lines of plugins for demo, what's the 
best way? A blog or code snippets in cookbook?

Thanks

Denis

I've just tested a dozen of SAGA algorithms, and they worked smooth! ;)
(ok, I admit, I'm on Windows :D)

@Gerhardus, Victor will be able to give you much more informations in the
near future. Sextante is like a toolbox, where pieces of functionalities
are kept together. It can leavarage external softwares (like SAG, R,
Grass), it can incorporate python scripts, etc., and it expose them to the
user in a uniform manner. The user will be able to chain these pieces
together, even through a graphical tool (the modeler), and he doesn't have
to worry much about where they come from, and how they are being called.
So, what is SEXTANTE good for?
 - users: for the reasons I've just said. A lot of different code are
exposed in a coherent manner
 - developers: incorporate their algorithms inside the toolbox, and don't
have to worry to manage user inputs, outpus, the GUI, etc. and they can
also use the other tools available from the toolbox...

This is just a synthetic flight on SEXTANTE ;)

That would have some advantages but probably miss out on all the
extended features you get with e.g. pg provider (ability to browse
tables, dbmanager etc).

It would be great to add it to http://snippets.qgis.org/snippets/ (you
just need a valid osgeo account for login there).

We should add a link to the snippets site in the cookbook.

The snippets is for 'random stuff' - the cookbook should cover
specific functionality in a sequential and structured way.

Hi

 >This would provide a benefit also to the other sw using GDAL/OGR, and 
would solve the problem of the license (I suppose)

Technically, I think it is better to write a native driver, because
- the OGR model is not 100% identical with the QGIS one. E.g. one table 
can contain multiple geometry types, OGR has datasource/layer model, ... 
(probably more that I don't recall now). Providing a proper mapping 
between OGR model and QGIS model requires more effort than a native driver
- more direct geometry transfer with native driver, thus better 
performance (with OGR driver, geometry is converted into OGR geometry first)

Regards,
Marco

 Hi,

 Does ODBC mean that there is no requirement that Oracle client 
 libraries are installed on the client machine (instant client or regular 
 client?) - or would this still be a requirement?

 Would users of the Oracle client need to install a system or user DSN 
 or does QODBC not require such an entry?

 Thanks and sorry about my ignorance (not knowing all the details about 
 ODBC).

Certainly. Featurrwise it should be the same as the Postgis and the other native DB provider.

Nifty snippet.

For connecting your signal to the lambda slot, how about new style instead?

self.helpAction.triggered.connect(
    lambda: QDesktopServices.openUrl(QUrl("http://my.help.site/formyplugin")))

Also, you may want to note adding the removal call to the 'def
unload(self)' method as well:

self.iface.removePluginMenu("&My plugin", self.helpAction)


btw: Your snippet seems to be appearing 3 times in the listing. Maybe
a glitch with the site?

Hi Larry,

Thanks for the tips. I corrected snippet #11.

I did not see before I had uploaded it 3 times (sic).
But how can I delete the other two???

http://snippets.qgis.org/snippets/users/3nids/ leads to a 404.
dunno why.

I'll take a look at why it is doing that.

Well, to use it you'd need an ODBC driver - but we wouldn't need to ship (and
link) one.

I think so.  Not sure there is an option to get away without a DSN.

QOCI would be another option - that would require Qt to be built with OCI
support - not sure if that'd impose a licensing problem, given that Qt is LGPL
now.

Hi Victor.
I noticed that, compared with PF, many SAGA commands are missing (but 
many of them are not functional in PF either): do you plan to add them, 
or there are good reasons not to include them?
All the best, and thanks.

I haven't added all those algorithm that are interactive, and those
that do not generate any result (algorithms to select in a vector
layer, algorithms that do something 'visual' within SAGA...) since
they do not make much sense.

However, if you are missing any algorithm, just tell me and I will add
it. It is easy to do it.

wow, I made the sudoku module long ago...had almost forgot about it :)
Glad to see that people noticed it (although it was quite useless :P)
I guess that was one of the last modules I programmed for SAGA...

By the way, why can't we actually use a file defined dsn with Qgis? Qt issue
or missing feature in qgis? 
(might be another topic.. sorry if it is)

Some of the ones I cannot fin in Sextante:
* direct neighbours (3)
* cluster analysis for point clouds
...
However, we should look for them programmatically, too boring to do it 
by eye.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7z8eDLxJ=v-647kxBC34ytWYMz=54M1o+=L69xWQ9__vQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have uploaded a small update to fix the bug reported by some of you
when running SAGA from SEXTANTE on Linux

I added also a few minor changes and improvements

You should re-install (re-download) SEXTANTE, since I uploaded it with
the same version number and the plugin manager will not tell you that
there is a new version. Sorry for this inconvenience. Now I know how
the plugin manager and the plugins system work and from now on I will
be adding new versions the correct way :))

It is not necessary now to manually setup the SAGA folder when in
Linux. SAGA, however, has to be correctly installed in the system, so
the SAGA folder is added to PATH and the SAGA_MLB variable is set. If
you can execute saga_cmd from your console, it should be ready to be
called from SEXTANTE.

Hope this helps you test and use the software.

Regards and thanks in advance for you collaboration

Hello,

For the hackfest, any plans to work on the documentation? We don't need to 
translate so I am wondering if there are other tasks that we (francophone 
community) could work on.

Jean-Roc, Otto, Vincent, others: any idea?

I would like to think a little bit about this before the hackfest as I have 
several question about this.

Thanks,

I saw Paolo Corti talking about rst on the list last week, I've 
Salvatore Larosa's work on rst for the dev-cookbook, etc.

Is there a possibility of finally making a step, even if it's one I 
don't like, adn start converting latex to rst ?

If not I'll work on the ui, the help file, etc. as I've not been able to 
work on these last month.

For the french contributors, a taskforce called "no plugin left 
untranslated" could be created :)

I've worked on a french translation of the QGIS python plugin dev workshop, 
and added some content.

There will still be some work to do on this at the hackfest to fix mistakes, 
retranslate into english the added parts, and try to get this documentation 
coherent with the rest of qgis docs. That's an RST documentation.

A whole checkup of every single field translated in the UI could be good as 
well, I've seen some strange translations popping up lately.

There is a thread on the community team ML about a new 
documentation/translation/i18n system, which would be RST-based if I read 
well, a lot of work to do in that field.

Hi,

Could the raster resampling branch be merged for 1.8 ? The public repo 
has not seen any change in the last two months so there is no added 
value of keeping it apart, maybe it's time to throw it to the crow to 
get more backup.

ok thanks. Mainly I am looking for non-developer task. So correcting, proof-
reading, moving to rst is the kind of task I was looking for.

It could be enough for 3-4 days for several people :)

Hi Yves
A couple of days ago I started a wiki page, linked from the main HF page,
with a skeleton of some of the task we could do.
I was thinking to add more details, so we could discuss here about it

Merging something that large into 1.8 this late makes me very nervous.  If
it had been in master for a couple of months then I would say cool, but if
it's in its own branch there wouldn't have been very wide user testing.

What is the performance like with large files?  If I remembered correctly
it struggled with my large ecws.

Hi devs,

forwarding this message to the qgis-dev list as it may be of interest.
I think this fixes a few CRS issues with .prj files and should be
included in 1.8.

regards,
Etienne

Berhard,

I thinks I have found a solution to your problem (in master only
though). I suspect the same can be applied to 1.7.4 , if gdal-1.9 is
used.

First, make sure that 'crssync' is executed after installing master,
this adds the necessary definitions that are missing. This is probably
why EPSG:31468 is not found.

Second, the value that is found is not EPSG:31468 but the deprecated
EPSG:31464 . I have added a patch for this in bug#4977:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4977

Please let me know if this works for you.

Etienne

I had similar issues Marco was working on that - I cant recall if it
maintains API compatibility either.  I'd also prefer to wait on it.

Yes if (when!) we move to gettext I'm afraid it will be quite a job in
the beginning for translators to migrate their content (you can do it
comfortably using QtLinguist from that point on though which is nice.

Also I would really like to see some consolidation of the various
docs, work on our own custom sphinx theme (would be a nice job for
html wizards) - I already made a simple QGIS one but there are lots of
features needed to replicate the output of the LaTeX manual as closely
as possible. Also migrating the t2t documentation to sphinx would be
nice.

I also wanted to raise the idea of moving all the context help stuff
into sphinx and away from the current 'loose files' system  - I used
this approach on a different plugin and it worked *really* nicely, its
much simpler for translators and the context help and the user docs
can be much more closely intertwined.

So heaps to do and lots of it needs no coding...

Tim

Hi

I have booked  flights to Lyon to join the Hackfest from 12th to 16th April 2012. I  will update the Wiki page when I manage to get my login working. I  wonder if anyone would like to share accomodation for the above dates  mentioned. The Adagio Access Lyon looks like a popular choice for other  attendees. I don't mind booking, but if anyone wants to share a room -  or has already booked and has a space available - please let me know.

See you there!

Hi,

I'm agree with Nathan: merging such large code when we are too close
for release may cause some problems and bugs.

Hi

 >The public repo has
 >not seen any change in the last two months

There is a raster_resampler branch in the public repo (with no change in 
the last two months) and the raster_resampler branch in the mhugent 
clone. In the second repo, I continously redesigned the raster layer 
class. At the moment, I'm splitting the writeXML / readXML code of the 
raster layer class to the renderer subclasses. My plan was to have the 
code mergeable until the developer meeting in Lyon and discussing 
pending issues there (e.g. gui design).

It would be possible for me to put some effort into it tomorrow to make 
the code mergeable. But then, it is very likely it introduces new issues 
because it changes large parts of QgsRasterLayer / 
QgsRasterLayerProperties (but it also resolves a few existing issues). 
So it probably is too risky for 1.8 (even if it does not break the API).

Regards,
Marco

My major concern with the 1.8 release is getting all the non api breaking
features from master into the 1.8 branch and keeping track of which ones
are in there.  master is so fast moving that it's hard to keep
track, especially when the order of commits (and some of the ids) are
different to the master line.

I tried to do a: git log master..release-1_8 which tells you which commits
are differing between the two branches.  I counted 589 commits using wc -l

IMHO what would be better would be to branch 1.8 from master now and revert
the commits that we know break API using: git revert {commit id}.  Dealing
with conflicts as we go.  I think the number of reverts would be less then
the number of commits that need to be cherry-picked and conflicts resolved.
 I'm not sure how many parts of QGIS are relying on the the breaking API
parts but I suspect it wouldn't be many.

Unless someone knows a better way to handle this.

I am happy to do this if we can get a handle on which specific commits
break api (or just add thin wrappers around api breakages if possible)
- though I dont know how simple it will be to do that....

Sounds like work for a special task force at the hackfest .. :)
It seems I should write some preparation mails to the translators anyway 
that they are aware that something big is coming soon :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] adding actions to my own toolbar
Message-ID: <061501cd0f4d$73e63ea0$5bb2bbe0$@gmail.com>

Hi all

 

I've just created my own toolbar and want to add some of QGIS default
commands (e.g. the FILE-OPEN command) to it.

At the moment it looks like this:  toolbar.addAction(FILEOPEN)  - What is
the correct QAction string?

Can anybody help me with the code? Looking for something like a list with
all available commands or so.

 

Many thanks in advance and kind regards from Switzerland!

Use one of the QActions that form part of the QGIS Api - see

Hello,

After working with the Symbology as a user for the past couple of days and
trying to accomplish various things, here is my idea of simplifying things:

Decouple Style management and Style application (renderer) logic at the GUI
level itself.

First let us start where it all begins, simplification of the GUI and
reducing the number of modal dialogs that keep opening as we go customizing
the symbol layers. This presumably is the best approach as it gives the
possibility to provide almost infinite customization options to the user.
But, customization of layers is not going to be my priority when I am
applying styles, or at least thats not what I intend to do. I just want to
see the styles and pick the most suitable.

If I want to be creative and design new symbols/styles, which I may now use
or may not now use, why should I be doing it in a layers properties dialog.
I would rather have a designer where I can design my styles of the liking.
I ma even get to preview a composition of all the symbol styles that I have
created.

So the idea is to create such a decoupled designer, which is something like
a "Style Manager ++ (decoupled)". I am writing the possible solution and a
couple of ideas as a proposal which might contain some over sighted goals.
Kindly go through, evaluate and comment.

Proposal:

+ Remove Symbol Creating/Editing capabilities from the "Style" tab of Layer
Properties and retain only application(renderer) customizations like, size,
color, angle etc., This will remove the iterative dialog popup situation
and also keep the clutter in the UI to minimum.
+ Create a new symbol designer, that can be summoned up from Menu rather
than from the properties
+ The designer to perform following functions
    - Create new symbols/styles
    - Grouping and management of styles through a tree structure
    - Create and manage virtual groups (or themes) that would pull symbols
from various groups and a combination of renders to create a overall
cartographic stylesheet (almost same as present save/load style).
    - Ability to save a retrieve such stylesheets (duplicates the present
save/load style)

Apart from the above solution, the GSOC proposal to include,

- Creating tree structure for managing the SVG symbols
- Creating a non-modal widget type editor to change symbols on the fly or
adding that capability to the Layers legend.

Apart from above functions, I must add that, this will be useful to handle
online symbol repositories and stylesheet repositories just like the python
Plugin manager. A spec can be developed just as it is done for the Python
plugins and online repositories can be created by anyone for easy sharing
of stylesheets and symbols, this can be handled through this interface.

I don't know how other people approach this but I experiment a lot with
different renderers and symbols, tiny changes and how the affect. If I have
to change between layer properties and a separate symbol designer all the
time, I think I'd go crazy. It's already annoying me that I cannot interact
with the map while the properties dialog is open.

Like the idea of symbol groups (aka themes). Not sure if it should be
symbol groups or style groups though. Style groups could prove too
inflexible.

Hi,

I think improving the symbology system would be very rewarding and
beneficial for many - but be sure to discuss the technical issues with
Martin and Marco. They probably know the system best.

Work on the SVG symbol repository and better management of the SVG
symbols (categories, metadata (also multilingual), ability to pick only
groups that interest the user (e.g. only geology, geomorphology), etc.)
would be great and benefitial to many. By default there should be fewer
SVG symbols but the repository should allow to easily add additional ones.

Other improvements I would like to see:

* ability to separately define opacity for stroke and for fill (e.g.
fill is transparent and stroke is not)
* ability to define separate units for each symbol component: e.g. the
size of the symbol (e.g. elliptical symbol) should be in map units, but
the stroke thickness in mm

Regarding the many nested dialogues:

I think there is a technical reason why there are so many nested
dialogues - it is because of the reuse of the dialogues in different
situations. As an example, a dialogue setting SVG symbols can be reused
for point symbols, but also for marker lines - or a color chooser can be
used in many situations. Also fill and stroke properties are reused in
different renderers.

I agree that from a usability point of the view the many nested
dialogues are not so optimal, but I remember hearing from Martin Dobias
that this way the whole system was easier to maintain and dialogues more
reusable.

Thanks,
Andreas

I could see this working it was somewhat like the Labelling(new) engine
dialog, where you could quickly change the current layer's symbol,
possibly opening it by clicking on the symbol in the legend. That way if
you have multiple symbols you can edit each quickly.

Not + for adding this direct symbol dialog opening but I would leave the
ability to reach it in the properties too.

Both, though for the initial tree I suggest groups based on folders
(symbol sets), for symbols that are not part of sets but them into
general categories (this is the current approach on the osgeo svn for
symbology).

This is what the idea I proposed a while back of embedding tags in the
svg xml is all about. It would allow a symbol to belong to multiple at
the same time. Also I would encourage you but a box in the interface
that let's people type names of symbols, eventually this will be used to
search a local tag database or query a web interface to find matches.

Yes that is the right direction. Another item on the roadmap is to
have the option to right click on a classes symbol in the layer list
and invoke the symbology editor directly.

I think if you can achieve what you lay out above it would be a huge
improvement in usability. The focus should be as much as possible on :

- simplicity (it should not be difficiult to work out how to create a
style you see on a map somewhere)
- efficiency (it should be quick to create, edit and clone styles)
- consistency (element of least surprise)
- minimising screen real estate (so it can work on devices with smaller screens

I don't want to overload your project with requirements, but at least
consider (ie not that you need to implement it but youd ui should make
allowances for this future feature to live on tge gui) in your design
the idea of 'social styling' where you can download and upload styles
into a central repostory using a well defined api. This would have two
use cases:

- uses want to obtain styles shared by others
- users want to share the styles they have created

The style repository should be user configurable, defaulting to QGIS's
official web style sharing site (which doesnt yet exist) but could be
changed to e.g. and corporate style store.

Live editing - thats what I am trying to do. The designer would also
provide a preview of what one does, let us say, we can add a functionality
of loading a sample dataset. A small map window is always there which
re-renders a sample dataset each of your tweaks. And working one the styles
until you are satisfied and you can save that settings as a theme/style.

I'm going to be a -1 one on this proposal.  I, like Antia, do a lot of
experimenting in the style dialog and I don't like the idea of having to go
somewhere else to define my custom symbols/or use them.

-1. If we have to go down the route of have a split designer it must be
easily accessible from the same place that you would pick the symbols.
 Making the user exit out of the properties dialog to define a new symbol
would be bad.

Use one of the QActions that form part of the QGIS Api - see

Hello,

After working with the Symbology as a user for the past couple of days and
trying to accomplish various things, here is my idea of simplifying things:

Decouple Style management and Style application (renderer) logic at the GUI
level itself.

First let us start where it all begins, simplification of the GUI and
reducing the number of modal dialogs that keep opening as we go customizing
the symbol layers. This presumably is the best approach as it gives the
possibility to provide almost infinite customization options to the user.
But, customization of layers is not going to be my priority when I am
applying styles, or at least thats not what I intend to do. I just want to
see the styles and pick the most suitable.

If I want to be creative and design new symbols/styles, which I may now use
or may not now use, why should I be doing it in a layers properties dialog.
I would rather have a designer where I can design my styles of the liking.
I ma even get to preview a composition of all the symbol styles that I have
created.

So the idea is to create such a decoupled designer, which is something like
a "Style Manager ++ (decoupled)". I am writing the possible solution and a
couple of ideas as a proposal which might contain some over sighted goals.
Kindly go through, evaluate and comment.

Proposal:

+ Remove Symbol Creating/Editing capabilities from the "Style" tab of Layer
Properties and retain only application(renderer) customizations like, size,
color, angle etc., This will remove the iterative dialog popup situation
and also keep the clutter in the UI to minimum.
+ Create a new symbol designer, that can be summoned up from Menu rather
than from the properties
+ The designer to perform following functions
    - Create new symbols/styles
    - Grouping and management of styles through a tree structure
    - Create and manage virtual groups (or themes) that would pull symbols
from various groups and a combination of renders to create a overall
cartographic stylesheet (almost same as present save/load style).
    - Ability to save a retrieve such stylesheets (duplicates the present
save/load style)

Apart from the above solution, the GSOC proposal to include,

- Creating tree structure for managing the SVG symbols
- Creating a non-modal widget type editor to change symbols on the fly or
adding that capability to the Layers legend.

Apart from above functions, I must add that, this will be useful to handle
online symbol repositories and stylesheet repositories just like the python
Plugin manager. A spec can be developed just as it is done for the Python
plugins and online repositories can be created by anyone for easy sharing
of stylesheets and symbols, this can be handled through this interface.

I don't know how other people approach this but I experiment a lot with
different renderers and symbols, tiny changes and how the affect. If I have
to change between layer properties and a separate symbol designer all the
time, I think I'd go crazy. It's already annoying me that I cannot interact
with the map while the properties dialog is open.

+1 for a tree structure.

Like the idea of symbol groups (aka themes). Not sure if it should be
symbol groups or style groups though. Style groups could prove too
inflexible.

Anita

Hi,

I think improving the symbology system would be very rewarding and
beneficial for many - but be sure to discuss the technical issues with
Martin and Marco. They probably know the system best.

Work on the SVG symbol repository and better management of the SVG
symbols (categories, metadata (also multilingual), ability to pick only
groups that interest the user (e.g. only geology, geomorphology), etc.)
would be great and benefitial to many. By default there should be fewer
SVG symbols but the repository should allow to easily add additional ones.

Other improvements I would like to see:

* ability to separately define opacity for stroke and for fill (e.g.
fill is transparent and stroke is not)
* ability to define separate units for each symbol component: e.g. the
size of the symbol (e.g. elliptical symbol) should be in map units, but
the stroke thickness in mm

Regarding the many nested dialogues:

I think there is a technical reason why there are so many nested
dialogues - it is because of the reuse of the dialogues in different
situations. As an example, a dialogue setting SVG symbols can be reused
for point symbols, but also for marker lines - or a color chooser can be
used in many situations. Also fill and stroke properties are reused in
different renderers.

I agree that from a usability point of the view the many nested
dialogues are not so optimal, but I remember hearing from Martin Dobias
that this way the whole system was easier to maintain and dialogues more
reusable.

Thanks,
Andreas
