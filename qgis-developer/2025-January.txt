Hi All, and happy new year!

We've just created a new QEP for enhancing UI/UX when configuring vector
layer forms.

Any feedback is welcome at:

Hello,

I've been also working on? this during a few times ago for a tutorial 
that I've never achieved: 
https://preview-pullrequest-1211--geotribu-preprod.netlify.app/articles/2024/2024-10-29_tester-qgis-4-futur-sig-open-source/#__code_1. 
The content is in French but QWT code is international ;).

Hope it helps.

Regards,
Julien

My metadata.txt file has version 1.0.
I cannot see anything "PLUGIN" anywhere in my files that would cause a
problem.
There is nothing on https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/landXMLtoDB/update/
that allows me to edit the version.
I cannot find an email for zimbogisgeek to contact.

I do not know how ro progress to fix this issue, sorry.

If you have any ideas, please let me know.

Roger

Dear Roger,

After checking the metadata.txt of the latest versions of VectorToDBLoader
and landXMLtoDB_Free, I noticed that the changelog field has defined values
but is still commented. For some reason, it confuses the workflow and the
last word `Plugin` becomes the version instead of `1.0`. I think this
should not be allowed (I will create an issue to add an additional check
for this case).

To fix the issue, I suggest uncommenting the changelog attribute like below
(or remove the values if you don't want them to show in the plugin details):

changelog=
> 1.0: After 1000+ downloads and nothing reported, I assume all is good with
> this plugin.
> 1.0: https://gismart.net/stores/spatialtapestry/ is the GoTo Store for
> more capable versions of this Plugin


Afterwards, you can upload the updated zip files for each plugin at
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/landXMLtoDB/version/Plugin/update/ and
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/vectortodbloader/version/Plugin/update/.

These processes should fix the version numbers and show the changelog on
the specific version details page.

PS: You can also find some notes about plugins publishing at
https://plugins.qgis.org/publish.

I hope this helps,

Best regards,

Lova Andriarimalala

Thanks Lova,
Made the changes, done the upload, fingers crossed.
I personally love using QGIS against PostGIS. Two amazing software products.

Hi there,

Recently whilst my colleagues and I have been using QGIS (various versions) we have been experiencing a glitch which really hinders our work.

As we are adding polygons etc, when we zoom into the project the polygons disappear, but then reappear once we zoom back out.

Have you heard of this before and please can you tell us how to fix this issue? We have tried fixed geometries and removing null geometries but none of this has helped.



Kind regards

Hi Loren,

You did not mention what kind of data you are working with.

Maybe shape files?
In that case this behaviour is possible/seen when the shape index (of your shape) is corrupt or wrong.
Can you try to ditch the shx file and create a new one via QGIS?

If not shape: provide some more details plz

Regards,
Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Spatial filtering of OAPIF layers
Message-ID: <ee86c94f-459c-4be7-bd40-63205bbe9a08@wheregroup.com>

Hi!

To potentially improve our spatial filtering plugin 
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/spatial_filter/ I am trying to figure 
out what is actually possible in QGIS in terms of spatial filtering of 
OAPIF and WFS layers via layer.setSubsetString(...).

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsVectorLayer.html#ogc-api-features-data-provider-oapif 
says

 > You can use various functions available in the QGIS Expression list, 
however the function must exist server side and have the same name and 
arguments to work.

Those filters are a complex setup around QGIS expressions, SQL queries 
and automatic OGC/FES filter conversion and I am currently too dumb to 
figure out what this actually means.

- Does "QGIS Expression list" refer to the list of QGIS expression 
functions and variables, visible e.g. in a Field Calculator dialog?

- Could someone name some example functions that one could use with a 
standard OAPIF server for server-side filtering?

Thanks!
Hannes


PS:
I have some strong suspicion that this line actually belongs to the WFS 
provider as it was originally written in the WFS section in 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/920253d17d1b109e47d3698f989a3d85a40054eb#diff-6e6383cd3adade52942c25186b2cf9985625fe338cadd3601a19467665eb455aR209 
and only got moved to the OAPIF section by Even's commit in 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/c7f29d501fde79d01776e0f891255199493ed88f#diff-6e6383cd3adade52942c25186b2cf9985625fe338cadd3601a19467665eb455a

If that is the case then I would still be interested in examples for 
WFS, instead of OAPIF, and to know what the documentation should read 
instead for server-side(!) filtering of OAPIF.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] I need a VPAT from one of the developers in order
 to use QGIS at my institution
Message-ID: <DS7PR20MB4599FDA7D2D0EC43B905BDDFC51C2@DS7PR20MB4599.namprd20.prod.outlook.com>

Hello developers!

I am hoping to get your help.

I would like to teach QGIS in my university courses, but I need permission to install it on my institution's computers. This requires a VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) to be filled out by one of the developers.

A VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) is a standardized document used to assess and report how well a product meets accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) or Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act. It provides transparency by detailing a product?s conformance to accessibility requirements, helping organizations understand if it can be used by individuals with disabilities. Government entities, including universities, often require VPATs as part of their procurement process to ensure that the technology they purchase is accessible to all users, in compliance with accessibility laws like Section 508 in the U.S. or EN 301 549 in Europe.

In the past (2013), QGIS developer David Saeger filled one out (https://web.archive.org/web/20130509053144/http://www.qgis.org/en/about-qgis/vpatm.html), but my institution requires a more recent version based on the most recent Section 508 criteria and updated for the most recent (LTR) version of QGIS.

Would any of you who are QGIS developers mind terribly filling out a VPAT and posting it?

To fill it out, you can visit: https://acreditor.section508.gov/ and then click on "start a new report."

If the information from the Saeger's original VPAT (https://web.archive.org/web/20130509053144/http://www.qgis.org/en/about-qgis/vpatm.html) is still valid, you can probably copy-and-paste much if not all of that information to the new form.

This would be invaluable to me and to anyone working for government entities and educational institutions who wishes to use QGIS instead of commercial options.

Thank you in advance for your efforts!


Sincerely,

Josh Banta

Dear Joshua,

I think you can also get in touch with the US User group, as mentioned in
the FAQ of QGIS.org at
https://qgis.org/resources/support/faq/#how-can-i-get-a-vpat--hecvat--other-us-compliance-form-or-information
.

Hi Gandalf,

You can pass variables in the command line cmake -DVAR=VALUE, or you can install ccmake and set them in the ncurses UI. ccmake also takes -D, just like cmake.
