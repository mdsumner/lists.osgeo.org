I will make all extra menu bars Mac-only so that additional menu bars do not appear for X11/Win QGIS where there are none today. Since the X11/Win bars would appear inside the window just above the toolbar, one viewpoint is that they just take up extra space and are somewhat redundant. For a Mac, however, the bar space is outside the window and not available for other uses so the lack of a menu bar makes an application look unfinished.

I don't like the idea of sharing a window for two views. This probably reveals my heritage as an early Mac user but one of the reasons I like a Mac and dislike Windows is that early Mac applications always had lots of windows while MSWindows applications tend to share a single window among multiple uses. I don't consider it an improvement that the shared window approach is displacing the multiwindow approach for recent Mac applications.

A good user interface offers more than one way to accomplish as task, however. Thus, I would favor a solution that, for example, offered a preference to reuse the main window or open extra windows for extra views so that different work styles can be accommodated.

Message-ID: <486AAB7D.2090007@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I finally did some more testing on plugins. I like very much the new
installer. One possible improvement: why not letting the user choose
whether to activate each plugin, without having to go to the plugin
manager menu? Furthermore,
I did not succeed installing the following:
- generate Voronoi polygons, LoadLayer, ManageR (This plugin seems to be
broken or have unfilled dependencies): it would be good to tell the user
what to do in these cases (install python-rpy)
- spatial operations (by tgwong, Official repo): it shows "upgradable"
but it does not upgrade (yes, I miss shapely). Moreover, there is a line
citing a readme file as a plugin (with broken dependencies).
There is a RGB composition plugin that has wrong name and icons in the
Plugins pulldown menu.
Formatting of the "about" popup for some plugins eg random point) is
wrong (lots of spaces in the center of the lines. It would be good if
the links inside would be clickable.
I strongly suggest to remove the old PostgreSQL geoprocessing tool in
favour of the much more powerful geoprocessing tools now available.
Great job, thanks a lot!

Hi Paolo,

The advanced printing branch is not yet ready to be merged. It is planned to 
merge it between the 0.11 release and the 1.0 release.

Thanks! Sorry I didn't give an account of works on Installer last weeks, but 
I'm working on it nearly every day so it's changing from day to day, as you 
can see if you have it installed. I'll write something more in the next days.

I'm not sure if there's any way for activating plugins directly from the  
Installer, however I'll try to find it when all the major features will be 
done.

> - spatial operations (by tgwong, Official repo): it shows "upgradable"

This is because the Authors often forget about updating both declarations of 
the version number: in the repository and in the plugin. In this case, the 
plugin has the internal number declared as 0.1 and in the repository it's 
declared as 0.2. So you can install it time after time and the Installer 
still sees version 0.1 installed and 0.2 available.

I'll add a workaround to the Installer for "downgrading" the available version 
from 0.2 to 0.1, as it is done with several plugins already. So you won't see 
this particular upgrade, but at least the Installer will be quiet ;) 

> Moreover, there is a line
> citing a readme file as a plugin (with broken dependencies).

It's because the readme file is outside the plugin directory. The Installer 
reports and lets to remove all such "strange" files. I'll contact the Author 
and ask for correcting it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to add a QDockWidget?
Message-ID: <20080703074441.137760@gmx.net>

Hello

somewhere between v0.10.0 and now the Legend and Overview Box was
changed from QToolBox to QDockWidgets.

Before it was possible to add my own ToolBoxItems by calling
QgisAppInterface::getToolBox() and then adding the items.

Now it should work by preparing QDockWidgets and then calling the
QgsApp member inherited from QMainWindow addDockWidget(
Qt::DockWidgetArea area, QDockWidget * dockwidget ). But I can't find
any Interface member to enable me to do this from a plugin?

Any suggestion, how to do this?

Ciao

Message-ID: <18256685.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi list
Looking the python plugins ideas on the wiki, I saw that someone wanted to
be able to see opentreetmap data within qgis.
I like the idea very much, since openstreetmap is increasing very fast the
amount of data in mainy countries around the world.

I just would like to share a link I found googling about openstreetmap :
http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/europe/

In this page, you will find daily updates of european openstreetmap data in
shapefile format.
It is so good I couldn't close my mouth for a while....
I let you have a look !!

So it is a bit different from directly accessing openstreetmap data, but for
a start...

The idea behind the plugin is to use OSM data directly, including the
editing and the upload of new traces, thus effectively replacing the
"official" josm (java, brrr) editing tool.
It shouldn't be *too* difficult: the OSM XML is well documented, it
should "only" be parsed back and forth.

Totally agree with you

This is completely different way of accessing the data from osm.

You say that the osm format is well documented. Why not creating a special
wiki page on this topic ?
We can start without any line of code : what needs, what functions, etc.

Here 's a start from scratch : functionnality needed and quick writtent
related questions :


Download :
* connect to openstreetmap server
Questions/Remarks: does it exist one, several, can anyone connect to it ?

* let the user select a geographical zone from which dowload data:
Q/R : - we need a basic world map (which projection ? WGS84 ?) 
- the user must be able to enter directly the box coordinates if he knows
them
- provide some quick access list (2 levels : continent --> countries)

* let the user select the features he wants to download (only primary road,
only footpahs..)
Q/R: - choose wich list of osm tags to propose (see osm wiki page)
- we can look at the work done in my previous link to get an idea of how to
organize data.

* transform the osm data into ogr format ?
Q/R : - in which format : gml (well documented, xml), shapefile, kml ?)
- Don't know how the geometries are managed under osm : simple and complex
ones (polygon with holes, multigeom, etc.) --> Is there a total
compatibility, or do we need to convert some geometries in others ?
- the converted data must be saved in the temp file of the os

Edition :
* here we must look at josm interface and see what functionnality to keep.


Ok I will stop here and wait for any remark /reply

Michael

Hi Markus

Firstly my apologies for the breakage of your toolbox related code -
we are busy cleaning up the UI for the 1.0 release and unfortunately
the toolbox was dropped. I'm going to change the plugin interface to
expose the addDockWidget call - can you please file a bug and I will
do this (unfortunately it will be ost 0.11.0 release since we are in
feature freeze. If this feature is really important to you and since
its scope is quite small we can put in a request for a last minute
change before 0.11.0 goes out to accommodate your needs.

Regards

Tim

Hi Michael.
I'm not that deep inside OSM: I'm forwarding your mail to our
OSMer-in-chief, Niccolo Rigacci (who is on holidays, but still mapping:
http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=38.7986&lon=20.6466&zoom=12&layers=B00FTF
). May I suggest you to forward this also to OSM mailing list?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,
I am not deep inside osm either. I have just map a little part of my city...
I think a collaboration between python/qgis coder and osm people will be
necessary to make this plugin possible.

Thanks for transferring the discussion by email to Niccolo Rigacci.
I will forward this discussion in the osm mailing list, but I still think a
page on qgis wiki will be the best way to share questions and solutions. (So
I will start one ;D)

Michael

I disagree. There is not an OSM "feature set", tags are free. You 
just download object inside the BBOX and their tags.

Just points and lines (which are collection of points) with 
attributes. The only problem I can foresee are "relations" which 
essentialy are sets of objects (point and/or lines) with 
attributes associated with the relation.

With relations we can handle several thigs, like a bounch of road 
segments which share the road name (relation's attribute) but 
have different speed limit (line's attribute), etc.

Message-ID: <20080703144234.236240@gmx.net>

Hi Tim

thanks for your answer.

I have partitially solved the problem by using this code, which works well for me:

QDockWidget *dock = new QDockWidget(tr("Hallo"), 0);
dock->setWidget(myGroupBox);
dock->setObjectName("Hallo");
dock->setAllowedAreas(Qt::LeftDockWidgetArea | Qt::RightDockWidgetArea);
qobject_cast<QgisApp *>(mQGisIface->getMainWindow())->addDockWidget(Qt::LeftDockWidgetArea, dock);

But I think this is clearly against the intention of the interface class to shield QgisApp from plugin calls, as I understand the getMainWindow() member should only be used when connecting to QMainWindow signals.

So it's not soooo urgent now, but it should certainly be done before 1.0 release.

Ciao
Markus

--> not a qgis export either, I let core developper answer this.

I google a bit and search the openstreetmap mailing list, and saw that a lot
of exporting tools has been developed, or are in developement :
http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/utils/export/

So we must reuse this tools (eg osm2kml.py) / adapt them.

Paolo, could you please create a page in qgis wiki related to that topic ? I
we go on like this, we will loose important remarks. (Sorry I did not
succeed)

Message-ID: <486D6EA2.9040307@uvic.ca>

Hello list,

This is likely a simple question, but I can't seem to be able to find a 
simple answer:
I have the following code for creating a continuous color renderer
>         render = QgsContinuousColorRenderer(QGis.Polygon)
>         render.setClassificationField(0)
>         symbol1 = QgsSymbol(QGis.Polygon, "", "", "")
>         symbol2 = QgsSymbol(QGis.Polygon, "", "", "")
>         symbol1.setFillColor(QColor(Qt.red))
>         render.setMinimumSymbol(symbol1)
>         symbol2.setFillColor(QColor(Qt.green))
>         render.setMaximumSymbol(symbol2)
and then later on I have my vector layer 'vlayer' and use:

> vlayer.setRenderer(render)
to set the renderer for this layer. Now when I add the layer to the map 
canvas, the renderer settings are set, but they are not displayed until 
I click on 'apply' after right clicking and going to the layers 
properties. So my question is what do I have to add to the above code to 
make this display properly?

Cheers,

Carson

Indeed, it's not difficult. This evening I've made a simple prototype
plugin for inspiration, check it from this repository:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/plugins-sandbox.xml

The plugin itself is very simple, doesn't take in account any tags nor
relations between objects, it just parses all nodes and ways and
creates appropriate layers. Btw. parsing big files (e.g. 50 MB xml)
takes quite a long time, there will be some inefficiencies.

You need recent SVN sources which include memory provider. To use it,
first get some file with OSM data in XML format (with current API
version = 0.5). There are some available for download on internet or
you can retreive them directly from OSM server like this by specifying
bounding box:
http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.5/map?bbox=11.54,48.14,11.543,48.145
(bounding box must have sides smaller than 0.25 degree)

I don't think I'll be continuing the development, I just hope that it
can serve as a starting point and some volunteer will take it and
improve greatly :-)
Finally, in a week I'm leaving for vacations, I'm going to be offline
for about two months so there's no time either.

Cheers
Martin

Hi Carson,

You might need to update the legend and call refresh on the mapcanvas:

QgisInterface::refreshLegend(QgsMapLayer*);
QgsMapCanvas::refresh();

Ok Paolo, thanks a lot

I will try Martin's test plugin and see if I can understand how it is
coded...

Hum hum..for the wiki page, I created an acount, but I see not link that
allows me to edit the page. Is there a hidden icon or something like that ?
When I tried to create "my page", the wiki told me "no right to modify this
page"...

thanks again

Hi:

I will try to compile the qgis api for windows mobile 5.
I have managed to compile most of dependencies:

gdal
sqlite
geos
proj

But now I found a problem, cmake does not have targets
for windows mobile platform. I have seen two possible options
one of them is generate qmake files for the api and the other
is to create the visual stuido project directly.

what could be the best option? or should I try to generate a new
platform target for cmake?

If the last is a good idea, any ideas to generate the platform
target?

Godofredo Contreras

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SoC Report: Homerange analyses in QGIS
Message-ID: <1215186243.6418.49.camel@galadriel>

Hello all, 

this week I succeeded retrieving information from R and loading
packages.
I changed the IDE, I'm feeling much better with Eric.
I modified how the combo box is filled with the point layers, because in
other plugins the list is obtained from MapCanvas, and layers present in
Legend but not shown in MapCanvas are ignored. The code of my plugin
considers all layers present in Legend and filters them to obtain only
point layers.
I also started creating the Python object that collects options from
QGis layer to be passed to R functions, and at the moment it contains
only coordinates. This will be fixed as soon as possible.
?Tests on Windows Xp are successful so far. As I'm using shell as
debugger, printing there control information, I can't make useful
testing because on Windows it's not easy to let QGis run in DOS mode.
In the future, debugging information and errors will be communicated
through MessageBoxes.

Next week I will make the plugin run a full MCP analysis. After this,
I'll implement also kernel analysis.

I'm not experiencing particular difficulties, except for Python: I'm
learning it progressively. Qt too are a bit complicated, but I'm getting
used of them.

Happy coding,

Anne

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Suggestions regarding QGIS Options
Message-ID: <8a1bc45c0807050007g5a4670bbh458b3366c244679d@mail.gmail.com>

                                 Respected QGIS developers,
                                                               Its really
nice of using your QGIS Tool. It will be more usefull if following options
are included.
1. There should be an option to merge two polygons of a shapefile. In case
of merging two polygons there should be an option to SUM the attributes of
the two polygon to form the new one.
2. It should allow Query in case of using Shapefile.(presently its not
suporting).
3. There should be an optio to represent polygon attribute with a
symbol.(this is for making multithem)
4. In case of using LINE Layer , say Railway line no option available for
representing actual railway track symbol.


Hope my suggestions will be accepted. Thanking You.

Hi Plugin/OSM guru's,

on the osm-dev list somebody made a mobile application for osm-data AND 
osm-tiles using Qt: 
http://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/dev/2008-July/010894.html
They speak about a QMapControl for easy OSM-tile display.
Would be great to have a pythonplugin for adding OSM-tiles as background 
also :-) ?

Regards,
Richard Duivenvoorde

For bigger bounding boxes you can use the OSMXAPI server:
$ wget 
http://osmxapi.hypercube.telascience.org/api/0.5/*[bbox=11.54,48.14,11.543,48.145]

Richard,

 QMapControl is a C++ class doing TMS management, 
 which is implemented in Merkaartor [1],  and it can be used 
 independent of python.

Hi Sajan

For spatial operations such as merging polygons, I suggest to look at
Horst Duster's python plugin. The other items on your wished list will
probably only be available in version 2.0 of QGIS or one of its
preview releases. Its always a good idea to add your wishes to the bug
tracker so we dont forget about them in the future.

Best regards

Tim

Hi Borys

I downloaded and tested your plugin today and its working well for me
in the basic testing I did. But since you are still working on this
and we have issues like how to distribute python plugins with QGIS
which have not been worked on, I think we are going to need to leave
integrating your plugin manager for then 1.0 release since I need to
branch for release as soon as possible now, and I would prefer your
manager gets well tested before putting it into the release.

Is this ok for everyone?

By the way well done - the user interface is very clean and neat!



Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

Me too:) In the beginning I was trying to keep the old Installer's writing 
style, but after a number of suggestions I've received and threats I've met, 
I've decided to completely rewrite it and drop its old construction. It's now 
almost done (I'm going to finish works on the planned features today or 
tomorrow), but it definitely needs a wider testing.

The main problem is that it's more vulnerable then the old one. For example, 
it has to compare the installed and the available version number, but the 
Authors often just forget to update the both declarations. Anyway, I've 
implement a number of prevent solutions for observed (and predicted) 
mistakes, anomalies, errors and troubles :) Furthermore I've replaced use of 
non-Qt modules with Qt ones and cleared the code to better meet the QGIS 
standards. I hope Perrygeo don't be offended. 

I think the best solution is to put it to the repository shortly after the 
0.11 release to have a long testing period before 1.0. 

Then we can also implement a few more python bindings to improve the 
Installer's capabilities and also discuss a dependencies control, a plugin 
classification and rules for developers. I would like to achieve a clear and 
well arranged plugin collection for QGIS 1.0... :)

> Is this ok for everyone?

and my ideas? :)

> By the way well done - the user interface is very clean and neat!

Thanks. It's also ready for switching to the list view and uniform QGISish 
look, only python bindings for the qgsdetaileditemdelegate class are needed.

B.

as promised I will try to spend some time on this idea.
Now I'm on holidays in Greece, where internet is so and so...


I will back on 11/07 and I will start to investigate the matter.

Hello List,

Can anyone give me some quick pointers on using the 
QgsContinuousColorRenderer.  No matter what I do I can't seem to get my 
layer to render according to the parameters that I'm setting. I end up 
with the right colours etc. set in the layers properties, but these 
settings are not applied to the layer?

Is there an example of how to use renderer's anywhere? I can't find 
anything on the WIKI or QGIS website....

Hi Borys

Ideas for managing versions you mean? Or for installing plugins
directly from the plugin manager? For the former I'm not sure what the
solution is and for the latter I think we can probably come up with
some way to do this.

Hi

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/branches/Release-0.10.0

I think we are missing the final tag of that branch (the tag would
match the current state of the above branch anyway so you can go ahead
and tag it if you have a need for the tag).

Regards

Try looking at src/app/qgscontinuouscolordialog.cpp. The apply method
should give you a good idea of whats needed.

Hi Tim,
thanks. No worries, I was just looking for 0.10 code and didn't know
where to end :)

It's the bigger trouble. Now the solution is a set of built-in workarounds, 
upgradeable with the whole Installer. After we move the Installer to 
the "permanent" plugin directory (and lose the upgradeability) I hope most of 
plugin authors will have it istalled and just see the possible errors. 
Furthermore, we can try to inform plugins developers, that from now proper 
plugin metadata will be much more important.

However, sometimes someone may not test it accurately, so some rapid response 
force will be required. I see 2 solutions:

1) The official repository admin(s) - a men to badger distracted authors 
and/or correct the repository entries. Maybe it's not so stupid as it sounds. 
I think we should divide the repository into two parts: open unofficial and 
moderated official. In this case some mechanism to estimate the quality of 
particular plugins and move them from the unofficial to the official 
repository will be needed anyway.

2) The installer should have a posibility to use a upgradeable plugin with 
workaround functions. I mean just a small upgradeable plugin only for use by 
the Installer (and even ignored by the Plugin Manager). This solution isn't 
too smart, so it would be reserved only for extreme and temporary cases.

If I understand the issues correctly, my envisaged scenario would be:

- QGIS ships with 1 or more python plugins which are installed to a
read only location
- if an upgrade becomes available, the upgrade is installed into the
users ~/.qgis/etc dir
- user local installed plugins should mask out read only system plugins
- we should definately have an 'official' and an 'unoficial' repo distinction
- in order for plugins to be 'official' they should be:
  * peer reviewed (or the authore at least vetted)
  * signed using pgp or similar scheme
  * use an appropriate license
- in order for a user to install an unofficial plugin there should be
a big red warning stating the potential security repurcussions of the
action they are about to take.

I think authors must be willing to demonstrate that they have paid due
dilligence before we act as an enabler for distributing their
software.

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <d368056f0807071616g38c5df8i9a712a15d54f0a90@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I think we are nearly ready for branching - Marco committed the new
srs updates that Maciej, Richard and he have been working on. The new
python plugin manager is being held off till next release. The only
thing left on my todo list is to get all the unit tests to run
successfully. I hope to resolve that tomorrow and then branch during
the course of the day. If I am not able to resolve all the issues in
the course of tomorrow (tues 8 June), I'll hold the branch until such
time as all tests run.

Peter: could you look at the raster tests? Currently 3 tests fail. The
first I fixed easily by changing the test, but I think its bad to
modify the test to make it pass. The issue seems to be that loading a
grayscale image the default histogram stretch is not correct. My
diagnostic hack was to do:

Index: ../tests/src/core/testqgsrasterlayer.cpp
===================================================================
--- ../tests/src/core/testqgsrasterlayer.cpp	(revision 8723)
+++ ../tests/src/core/testqgsrasterlayer.cpp	(working copy)
@@ -112,6 +112,10 @@
 {
   QVERIFY ( mpRasterLayer->isValid() );
   mpMapRenderer->setExtent(mpRasterLayer->extent());
+  mpRasterLayer->setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm(
+      QgsContrastEnhancement::STRETCH_TO_MINMAX, false);
+  mpRasterLayer->setMinimumValue(mpRasterLayer->getGrayBandName(),0.0, false);
+  mpRasterLayer->setMaximumValue(mpRasterLayer->getGrayBandName(),10.0);
   QVERIFY ( render("raster") );
 }


Could you confirm if it is your idea that we should mandate histogram
stretch definition explicitly now, whether it should be set to min /
max using band limits by default and this is a bug, or if something
else is afoot here that I'm missing? I'm going to look at the other
two failed raster tests tomorrow and see if I can work out why they
fail.

Marco: The renderer tests that check symbology and qgs/qml seem to be
performing much better now - there are slight differences as you will
see if you run the qgsrenderer test, but they are small enough that
I'd be happy to recreate the test control images so that the tests
pass. Is your work with rev-up fix for rendering issues complete or
should I hold before creating new control images?


All:

If anyone else has anything pending that we should wait for before
branching and calling for packaging, please let me know as soon as
possible and we can try to accommodate you.

Also please note if you would like us to mention any particular cool
new feature introduced in this release, please let the release team
know so we can include it in the press release.

Best regards

Tim

Yes, this is exactly what I mean. I would like to achieve this whole framework 
done for 1.0 release.

It's even much better than I've planned. Thanks.

Of course. I see the unofficial repo as a kind of quarantine for testing. And 
all the "quick" and underdone, but still useful plugins will just remain 
there.

First off, sorry for my total lack of contribution over the last couple 
of months it has been a hectic spring...

First test - Grayscale Image: The default contrast enhancement when the 
QSettings value was not found was incorrectly set in revision 8398 when 
I added the override functionality. As generally agreed upon, it should 
have been set to a min max enhancement for comfort of newer users. I 
have committed the change. However, this test can still fail if you have 
set a different enhancement to be your default (check the raster 
properties dialog, lower right, initial tab)

>   

I see three possible places for problems, none of which may actually be 
a bug, just a difference in rendering since the test/result  images were 
first generated
1) Again, your chosen default contrast enhancement may be causing a 
conflict (but should not be an issue with the third test because a qml 
file is being loaded)

2) The image now loads on the first pass with an estimated min max 
rather than calculated values. One band in each of these two tests does 
show differences between the estimated min max and actual min max -- 
again this should not be an issue with the third test since a qml file 
is being loaded

3) There has been a change with the how the default extent is 
determined, I recall there being some discussion of this, the default 
extent is now a little more than the datalayer. Given the regular 
banding that appears in the difference image, I am inclined to believe 
that this is the cause of the difference. I will be traveling Jul 8 and 
9th with sporadic Internet access, but can dedicate the 10th to more 
digging if it is not too late.

Message-ID: <200807080914.20828.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Hi all,

I wrote a plugin for spatial interpolation. The plugin is still in 
experimental stage. However, it already is possible to produce raster layer 
(ascii grid format by now) from a vector layer using linear triangulation or 
inverse distance weighting. The plugin code is here:

http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/interpolation_plugin.tgz

To compile, unpack in src/plugins directory and add 'interpolation' to the 
first line in src/plugins/CMakeList.txt:

 SUBDIRS (copyright_label delimited_text grid_maker north_arrow scale_bar 
interpolation)

The code for triangular interpolation originates from my phd several years 
ago. There are some capabilities that are provided by this code which are not 
accessible through the plugin GUI yet:
- cubic triangular interpolation (clough-tocher methode or coons patch)
- modify the delaunay triangulation by swapping edges
- mark input data as constrained triangle edges or breaklines


The interpolation plugin is generic enough to support other type of 
interpolation methods. If you want to see your favorite interpolation method 
in QGIS, all you have to do is to provide a subclass of QgsInterpolator and a 
subclass of QgsInterpolatorDialog that takes the parameter for the 
interpolation method. 

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco

I made a quick patch so that you can build it out of qgis source tree.
The install prefix in cmake .. will be ignored - the plugins will go
into your qgis plugins dir based on which qgis instance you are using.
I build like this:

ccmake .. -DQGIS_CORE_LIBRARY=/home/timlinux/apps/lib/libqgis_core.so

I made a quick test run using the points layer in qgis tests/testdata
and it worked great!

Hi

Ok I've assigned all other tickets (from current and previous
milestones) to milestone 1.0 and those listed by Maciej to milestone
0.11.0.

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/milestone/Version%201.0 Gives a nice
overview of what we have to achieve for version 1.0. Possible to
achieve in 2 months? Who knows we can only try to kill as many as we
can....

If you look at the break down by maintainers of the different areas of
the code base (raster, vector etc) its actually not to much of a
mountain to climb if each maintainer can chase down their bugs ....
probably we need some more maintainers too for areas of the code that
are not directly curated....

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

from tomorrow morning I'll be "on the road" again with qgis; I think I can 
surely kill almost 2 bugs in the MS-Windows (filtered) list.

Regards,

Marco

Tim and/or Marco,

Do you have any guidance on where to draw the line between a bug and a 
'new' feature? In some cases this distinction may be a little fuzzy and 
a bug fix may take the form of something that is more akin to a new 
feature or enhancement.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] technical experts for manual rewrite
Message-ID: <20080709073820.1e86b81c@nature>

Dear Developers-

When the manual team updates the manual for the v1.0 release, we hope to 
communicate the best description of what the features are and how to 
implement them. Therefore I would like to identify at least one 
technical expert for each chapter who is thoroughly familiar with those 
aspects of the software that are covered in that chapter, preferably 
someone involved in the development of the code, who is willing and 
available to answer technical questions that may arise while we write 
the manual updates. If you are willing to proofread for technical 
accuracy, that would also be good but not required.

The rewriting will begin after the v1.0 feature freeze, which I am 
guessing will occur around Aug 15, and continue for some while (say one 
week) after the GUI freeze currently scheduled for Sept 15. So the 
experts need to be available at least some of the time from Aug 15 to 
Sept 22.

*******************************************************************************
Please respond to Tara Athan tara_athan[at]alt2is.com if you are  willing to
act in this capacity for one of the chapters below. *
*******************************************************************************

The chapters are:

3. Getting Started (including GUI, Rendering, Measuring, Projects, 
Options, Spatial Bookmarks)
4. Working with Vector Data (including shapefiles, PostGIS, Vector 
Properties, Editing, Query Builder)
5. Working with Raster Data (including supported formats, loading, 
Properties dialog)
6. Working with OGC Data (including WMS, WFS)
7. Working with Projections (including supported projections, 
specifying, custom)
8. GRASS integration (including starting QGIS, loading, locations, 
vector model, digitizing and editing, region, toolbox, new layer)
9. Making Mapserver Map Files (including creating project and map file, 
testing map file)
10. Map Composer (including adding a map, adding other elements, other 
features, creating output)
11. Using Plugins (including overview and plugin manager, decorations, 
delimited, GPS, Graticule, Georeferencer, Python Plugins)
    * multiple experts needed, one for each plugin
12. Creating Applications
13. Help and Support
A. Supported Data Formats
B. Installation Guide

If you know of a feature that is not covered in any of these chapters, 
please let us know as soon as possible so we are sure to have everything 
covered in the outline.

I think it is an useful list.
Why not adding it to http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/TimSutton ?
Also, I think bugs should be reassigned to milestones
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/report/3
35 tickets are not assigned to any milestone, and only 4 are for 0.11,
while I guess there are more.
All the best.

Hi

My pleasure. In case it wasnt obvious from my last email if you are
compiling against QGIS in a 'default' location there is no need to do
anything more than

ccmake ..

to configure. Parameters I listed were for if you want to compile
against a non standard location for QGIS.

Regards

Tim

Ok I will get those 35 assigned to a milestone

>and only 4 are for 0.11,

Yes thats the 4 remaining of the ones Maciej mentioned. All other bugs
I have moved to be against 1.0.0 since since once I am done with the
0.11.0 issues I will be branching 0.11 for packaging and release.

> while I guess there are more.

I did a bunch of cleanups of the bug queue yesterday - any more issues
you notice please let me know. All new & remaining bugs should be
filed against 1.0.0 milestone (which I have set to be the default
milestone now).

Regards

Tim

Yes, if there are no objections from other devs, I'm going to commit it to 
qgis svn after the feature freeze is over.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Update map after adding new feature
Message-ID: <18363257.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi, all!
I'm newbie in Qgis and Python plugin development. I'm attempt to write
Python plugin that read some exchange format and create new polygon features
in PostGIS vector layer. For inserting features used code:

vLayer = QgsVectorLayer("D:/test",  "test",  "ogr")
ft = QgsFeature()
ft.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolygon([lstCoords]))
ft.addAttribute(0, QVariant(attr0))
ft.addAttribute(1, QVariant(attr1))
ft.addAttribute(2, QVariant(attr2))
ft.addAttribute(3, QVariant(attr3))
vLayer.addFeature(ft)

lstCoords - is list of QgsPoints; attr0...attr3 - some strings with
attributes.
My first problem is: after inserting no feature appear on the map window and
no new records in the layer attribute table. But when this layer reloading,
new features are visible and accessible. I'm try to use startEditing(),
commitChanges(), setModified() and updateExtents() methods of QgsVectorLayer
but this don't help. I'm think that I must rerender map after adding new
feature...  but I don't understand how to do this. Can anyone give little
example of updating map after adding new features to layer?

P.S.: sorry for my bad English, I'm ukrainian

Message-ID: <03B9471F-83AD-41D8-80C8-5A36518BB52F@wildnevada.org>

Barry,

I noticed the other day that the select tool does not actually make  
any selections on the Mac platform (OS X 10.5.4). I tried on polygon  
and point layers, using freehand, polygon and radius selection. (The  
latter did not provide any user feedback for choosing a radius.)  
Nothing is reported in the console, but I can try a debug build if  
that will be helpful.

I filed a bug on the qgis tracker for this before I realized it was a  
python plugin, then Tim pointed out that this was not in the code  
base. The plugin version is 0.2 from your repo.

Regards,
John

Message-ID: <EDFC4DC3-5571-4B67-8255-8744F3568FBF@wildnevada.org>

Tom,

I was wondering if you have been seeing problems with labels in qgis  
using qt-4.4.0, pyqt-4.4.2? Below is an example of how my labels are  
being truncated to rightmost characters in the map canvas. It seems to  
be something like a 50% truncation, so long labels show more  
characters than short labels, but everything is being cut short.

Someone on irc and linux with qt-4.4.0 did not have this problem, so I  
am trying to see if this is happening with other Mac users.

I have built the most current svn, am on 10.5.4, and seemed to only  
have this problem after upgrading Qt.

Regards,
John

John,

Labels work for me using current svn, Qt 4.4.0 and OS X 10.5.4. I don't use Python. Trying to match your example, all I did was select a label field in the Vector Layer Properties dialog and check Buffer Labels.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [SoC] problems with R-Python data interchange
Message-ID: <1215686868.6406.32.camel@galadriel>

Hello all,

the progress of my work is being blocked by a data interchange problem
between R and Python.
I succeeded in converting a Python dictionary (containing lists) into a
dataframe and pass it to R. (line 160 of interfaccia.py)
The next step is to apply the function that calculates homeranges.
This function is called HR_cruncher and returns a list of lists, of
class "homerange" (custom class, it is not a standard R object).
Here is the piece of code. Full code is available on the repository [1],
updated right now. pluginProva is the folder of the plugin, just copy it
in QGIS python plugin folder.

      r.require('rgdal')
      r.require('adehabitat') 
## FIXME: set more general import mode. But it runs.
      motore = '~/apps/share/qgis/python/plugins/pluginProva/motore.R'
      r.source(motore)
      exporter =
'~/apps/share/qgis/python/plugins/pluginProva/exporter.R'
      r.source(exporter)
      print "DEBUG infos about the data dataframe"
      print r.str(data) # it works also on no conversion mode. O_o ?!?
      #FIXME: not sure if line below works. Sure that the exporter line
doesn't work.
      #IDEA: if not easy to run around this problem, consider to source
an entire R script.
      set_default_mode(NO_CONVERSION)
#      homeranges = r("""HR_cruncher(data, method="mcp")""")
      print "###"
      print r.str(r("""HR_cruncher(data, method="mcp")""") )

Even if I use NO_CONVERSION mode, this is the output I obtain:

Loading required package: rgdal

###
 chr [1:3] "function" "OptionalFunction" "PossibleMethod"
<Robj object at 0xd0e470>

I guess that this kind of object has no possible conversion for Pyhton.
This is not a problem, because it has to be passed as is to the next R
function. 

Any suggestions?

regards,

Anne

Hi all,

    i?m a newbie in Qgis, after using other Gis software. I was reading about qgis plugin program and installed all stuff, but still have a problem.
I have installed Qgis 0.10, enthought python 2.5, windows python extensions for 2.5 and pyQt4. I have Qgis\python path in my PYTHONPATH variable but when i try :

from qgis.core import * ( in pythonwin)

then it says it can?t find one module or library... In Qgis python interpreter these sentence works perfectly. How can i solve this?

Thanks in advance,

Gus

Thanks for the test. I just cannot think what is causing my problems  
with labels on the canvas... Care to share your Qt configure  
arguments? Maybe there's a problem there, although I tried the binary  
installer as well as home-rolled with the same label problem in either  
situation.

Cheers,
John

Alex,

you should really update map canvas to see the change. This piece of
code should do that:
iface.getMapCanvas().refresh()

(where "iface" should be reference to QgisInterface object which is
passed to plugin on initialization)

Hi Gustavo,

I think there are two possibilities:
1. you've set PYTHONPATH variable incorrectly - check whether the path
to qgis bindings is really included:
>>> import sys
>>> print sys.path

2. windows can't find qgis_core.dll - you should add QGIS directory
containing this DLL to PATH variable.

Message-ID: <48771568.5040100@o2.pl>

I have been noticing this for couple of months now, on two amd64
machines (Ubuntu Gutsy and Debian testing). Has anybody experienced a
similar thing? What could be the culprit?

It happens once every 10 or 20 QGIS startups. There is no particular
info on the terminal when the freeze takes place. Sometimes if I leave
QGIS alone in such case for a few seconds, it finally starts. Yet
sometimes after waiting a minute I have to kill it. Then, pressing
CTRL-c does not always suffice and sometimes I have to kill -9 the qgis
process. QGIS built without debug never suffered from this issue.

Thoughts?

Message-ID: <1215777241.487749d9a59fa@mail.studenti.uninsubria.it>

Hi all,

this week I fighted a lot with how to make R and Python interact.
The problem I pointed out on qgis-dev and RPy lists [1] is now solved.
I'll put the code on SVN next week, as the machine on which I'm working won't be
connected until Tuesday. 
Now a full MCP analysis is callable through its window. I have to fix how some
options are passed to the plugin, because for the moment the path to R scripts
is peculiar of my personal installation, and the folder where output shapefiles
are written is the R working directory (r.setwd() returns an error). 
In addition, I will protect the execution from errors coming from uncorrect
data. At the moment, Python exceptions are raised but not handled.

Next week I will review the main scheme of the plugin. There will be two ways of
running the analyses: MCP or kernel alone, or a batch mode. This mode will
collect all options for MCP and kernel analyses, and then run them all in a
bunch. This means changing some signals/slots and refactor a bit.

I'm experiencing some difficulties with RPy and Python, but in overall I've got
no blocks.

regards,

Anne Ghisla

I don't think it does.   Actually I don't think it cares at all as it
only calls libraries, so I'd expect the same when you work with GRASS
directly.

Those are probably also not changing any access rights explictly, but
are just creating, deleting and removing files when editing.

In that case setting umask to 0007 might help, if you don't want
world-readable files (at least on *x).

No, the only thing I noticed on amd64 is that the default GDAL library
package makes qgis crash (when loading the north arrow plugin).  A GDAL
compiled without optimization doesn't have that problem.  I think this
was introduced with gcc 4.3.

Right, I should have checked that - indeed the problem is down to GRASS,
not QGIS.

So it seems. umask helps.

Many thanks for replies, Carson and Martin.
I'm try do add code that refresh map canvas, but this don't help.  Layer
manually added to TOC. I'll tested plugin on both types of vector layers
(PostGIS and shapefile) and have no result - features don't appears and
attribute table still empty... Only after layer reloading all becomes ok.
Maybe, I'm do something wrong? My last code is:

mc = self.iface.getMapCanvas()
vLayer = QgsVectorLayer('D:/test', 'test', 'ogr')
#vLayer = QgsVectorLayer('dbname='geobase' host=127.0.0.1 port=5432
user='postgres' table="public"."proba" (the_geom) sql=', 'test', 'postgres')
fet = QgsFeature()
fet.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolygon([lstCoords]))
fet.addAttribute(0, QVariant(attr0))
fet.addAttribute(1, QVariant(attr1))
fet.addAttribute(2, QVariant(attr2))
fet.addAttribute(3, QVariant(attr3))
vLayer.startEditing()
if vLayer.addFeature(fet, True):
	vLayer.commitChanges()
	vLayer.setModified()
        vLayer.updateExtents()
	mc.refresh()

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Avoid segmentation fault on selection when commit
Message-ID: <48776E0B.5020901@archivideo.com>

Hi all,
I develop Qgis plugin and I have a little problem with selections and 
commit.
_
Steps :_

  1. You select added features (they have negative id).
  2. You commit change (commit attribute positive id to added features)
     but your mSelectedFeatureIds haven't updated and have always
     negative Id in mSelectedFeatureIds.
  3. If the user doesn't reselect features, you have a segmentation
     fault because if you do a iteration on mSelectedFeatures there are
     wrong id.


_A possible solution :

_

   * Erase all negative ids in commitChanges
     
<http://doc.qgis.org/classQgsVectorLayer.html#fab34baf331320a8c3212993f5fccfa1> 

     ()

Advantage : easy to do
Disadvantage: user's selection change when he commit

   * Provider return new id of added feature and replace in
     mSelectedFeatureIds.

Advantage :  no change for user when he commit.
Disadvantage : more change to do in code.

Ps: I attach patch of first solution.

The only parameter I use with Qt configure is -universal. Is text being truncated in the demo and example apps that come with Qt? This would determine if the problem is in Qt or qgis.

Next I would check what string is extracted from the feature at QgsLabel::renderLabel line 106. You can work forward or backward from this point depending upon whether or not you see the full string.

I was building with several options, including nomake-demos! I'm going  
to rebuild Qt today without any configure args and then report back.  
Thanks for the suggestions.

Hi Marco,

A colleague of mine is doing a course that requires some of the features 
from the latest svn. His course is of course taught on Windows machines, 
so I'm trying to build QGIS for windows, and am having trouble setting 
up my msys environment. I was wondering if you (or anyone else on the 
list) has a copy of the msys.zip file that was once online?

Cheers,

I rebuilt, this time with demos and examples. I cannot find anything  
out of the ordinary perusing the examples and demos, but I'm not sure  
if there is anything quite like the labels used for  vector items in  
qgis. If you know of a specific example, I'll do some more testing.  
Otherwise, I'm stymied.

Regarding the string check, I'm not sure how to test that.

Thanks,
John

probably would have a better idea of which solution you propose is
better.

Message-ID: <d368056f0807120050l20bd08a3k5b7bb0ac369106ae@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I will branch tonight (SA time), there are three last things to resolve:

  - Maciej can you test my solution for #1141? I'll probably just
commit my change if I dont hear from you since I dont think it should
cause any side effects.

  - Peter Ersts any more thoughts on the unit test? We have two
options - release QGIS with the broken (but valid) test, or update the
control images with the slightly uneasy feeling of not knowing why
rendering is producing slightly different output. Can you tell me
which option you prefer?

 - Marco in order to fix the unit test for quickprint, I had to modify
src/gui/qgsquickprint.cpp like this

   229   int myOriginalDpi = mpMapRender->outputDpi();
 +230   //sensible default to prevent divide by zero
 +231   if (0==myOriginalDpi) myOriginalDpi=96;
   232   QSize myOriginalSize = mpMapRender->outputSize();
   233   int mySymbolScalingAmount = myPrintResolutionDpi / myOriginalDpi;

   The problem seems to be that mpMapRender->outputDpi() returns zero
in some or all situations which seems wrong to me. I remember you were
doing some work in this area with the rendercontext stuff. Do you have
any idea whats happening here? My change prevents the crash for now
but output is pretty wonky with very large symbols.

Many thanks all, I'll post an announcement tonight once I have branched.

Regards

It brings bug #1120 back (SRS k parameter always set to 0)!

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1120

Not having #1141 fixed is as bad too.

Thanks for all your hard work too! However, I don't think QGIS should be
relaesed in it's current state, yet, given bugs #1120 and #1141.
Regressions are the worst kind of bugs. The regression in support for
non-US characters in GRASS will repel folks from using QGIS-GRASS
integration.

There is still also an outstanding bug in map composer - removing an
item in the map composer is not saved in the project:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/924

I tested it and seems all issues mentioned in bugs #1141 and #1120 are
fixed. Great! For side effects - what could they be?

What about this remaining thing:

Any chances it would be fixed? It prevents from re-using exisiting map

If you haven't already checked, open the Attribute Table display and check the label column. If the column is ok, do the following.

In core/qgslabel.cpp, add the line

qDebug() << "Label:" << text;

after the block:

/* Text */
value = fieldValue ( Text, feature );
if ( value.isEmpty() )
{
  text = mLabelAttributes->text();
}
else
{
  text = value;
}

Also add the line "#include <QDebug>" to the top of the file.

The new debug line should be line 116.

Build and run qgis from a terminal and you will see the label text extracted from the features. It should be the same as displayed in the attribute table. If the text is complete, the problem is in the next ~300 lines and more qDebug lines can be added to find it.

I'm looking at it but sooner or later we have to say enough is enough,
we release what we have. Holding up the release for 1 bug has great
knock on effects to release plans - no devs are committing stuff
because we are in feature freeze etc. We will never get it perfect in
every release so all we can do is make sure its as good as we can make
it within the time we have and then release. This case is especially
important because delays are eating into our release window for 1.0.

Also I'm loathe to spend days tracking down composer issues when the
first thing thats going to happen after release is Marco is going to
merge in his composer work.

So tomorrow night I'm really really going to branch come hell or high water....

Regards

Tim

Labels are fine. This happens with all vector layer labeling, no

Carson,

I can't offer a copy of the msys.zip file, but I have recently built my own
MinGW/MSys building environment on Windows XP and can offer some tips. I
have generally used the latest production releases of the various 
libraries. I used Marco Pasetti's
http://www.webalice.it/marco.pasetti/qgis+grass/BuildFromSource.html as the
starting point.

My MinGW/MSys was built using the latest 'current' versions and in the
default locations.

1. be sure all import libs are named lib*.dll.a or lib*.a (the MinGW linker
prefers the lib*.dll.a form over the typical static *.a) zlib, in
particular, has an import lib named in a non-standard way - zlibdll.a

2. the pre-built binaries for PostgreSQL, for example, can be used if the
path to the includes/libs does not contain spaces. Use the short form of the
directory name, like C:/Progra~1/... instead of C:/Program Files/..

3. some libs should be built with mingw32-make from a Windows command prompt
if a makefile for MinGW is found. SIP and PyQt create mingw makefiles, so
these, as well as QGIS should be compiled from Windows command prompt.

4. be sure that CMakeSetup points library paths to the *.dll.a files rather
than *.dll  Linking directly to .dll files doesn't work in some cases.

5. if you want to use GEOS 3.0.0 QGIS needs to be compiled with
-DGEOS_INLINE  in CXX_FLAGS

If you have problems with specific areas, let me know. I have some specific
instructions for several of the libs, but haven't got them in a form ready
for sharing with the QGIS community.

Hmmmm, I changed that because it failed prior to that. Now it works,  
so it was probably an ovelooked typo on my part.

The labels show correctly in the Terminal, e.g.:
Debug: Label: "Fire Mountain"

When the labels are displayed, is truncation always between letters or do you see partial letters?

Have you tried changing font, size, style, alignment and rotation? Is the truncation different for any of these or do you see the same partial string?

Line 399 does the display:
painter->drawText ( dx, dy, text );

Try another qDebug() line just before it to see if the value of 'text' has changed. I don't anywhere it could change however.

A clipping rectangle is another possible culprit but I don't see one in use. There is a drawText variant that uses a QRect rather then two ints. When I saw your image, my suspicion was that a bad clipping rect was being computed and passed to drawText.

If changing the label properties doesn't produce any new oddities, the only other thing I can think of is to look at the source for drawText to see how it processes its parameters.

Calm down. ;)  That's fixed in r8760.  Although I need to fix the log

Partial letters will show. Placing labels in the bottom right makes them
work, top left they disappear altogether. Variations in between those
extremes, including only seeing the top half of the label, etc. My current
fix is to place labels to bottom right. It is as if there is an invisible
box being drawn that blocks the labels, but nothing else on the map canvas.

Yes, as above.

Still reporting the labels intact.

Thanks for all the suggestions. I hope this one can be figured out, and I

Message-ID: <d368056f0807131720k5afb53e0h309005f4225065c2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks (and especially package makers and release team)

Tonight I created the release branch (revision 8769) for 0.11.0 Metis:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-0_11_0

Only packaging related changes should be made against this branch. If
the kind folks who usually create packages for various platforms and
distros could set about making 0.11.0 packages we would be most
grateful. The list of normal packagers is listed at the top of:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist0.11.0

If you are not able to package this release and are listed on the page
above please let me know, If you are able to package for a new
platform / distro please let me know and I will add your name to the

Oggetto: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 0.11.0 'Metis' - Call for packaging
 
Hi Folks (and especially package makers and release team)

Tonight I created the release branch (revision 8769) for 0.11.0 Metis:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-0_11_0

Only packaging related changes should be made against this branch. If
the kind folks who usually create packages for various platforms and
distros could set about making 0.11.0 packages we would be most
grateful. The list of normal packagers is listed at the top of:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist0.11.0

If you are not able to package this release and are listed on the page
above please let me know, If you are able to package for a new
platform / distro please let me know and I will add your name to the
list.


Release team please note that I moved the date of final announcement
of release to 21 July 2008. It will be great to have all press
announcements ready for then!

Many thanks once again to all those helping to prepare this release!

Best regards

Hi, 

There is a problem compiling QGIS on OpenSUSE Version <= 10.2.

[ 9%] Building CXX object src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/qgsapplication.o
/usr/src/packages/BUILD/qgis-0.11.0/src/core/qgsapplication.cpp: In static
member function 'static QString QgsApplication::reportStyleSheet()':
/usr/src/packages/BUILD/qgis-0.11.0/src/core/qgsapplication.cpp:272: error:
'class QColor' has no member named 'lighter' make[2]: ***
[src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/qgsapplication.o] Error 1 make[1]: ***
[src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/all] Error 2 make: *** [all] Error 2
error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.4612 (%build)

opensuse 10.2 uses libqt4-4.2.1-18 and fails opensuse 10.3 uses libqt4-4.3.1-23
and works. Do I definitely need qt4 >= version 4.3 or is this another problem?

Yes.  There was a vote about dropping 4.2 support.  See

Hi Marco

Many thanks. Please could you also look at the win packaging related
issues in the bug queue against milestone 0.11.0?

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&milestone=Version+0.11.0

Also, I would like to put a new msys.zip on qgis.org (we still haven't
restored it since the server outage). When you are done packaging
could you create a msys.zip for us to put online?

Many thanks for your help!

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <d368056f0807140229r5accd583ie55008a357adaef1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks

In the ongoing effort to sort out the bug queue and simplify things
I'd like to reduce the number of ticket types from:

defect  	 	
enhancement 		
task 		
bug 		
patch

To:

enhancement 		
bug 		
patch

Since we pretty much don't have a culture of handing out tasks to each
other task seems irrelevant.  More usefully, the distinction between
defect and bug is not obvious and we should IMHO drop the defect type.
I will reassign all defects to bug type.

Any objections?

Regards

Hi, 

there are now QGIS 0.11.0 test packages available for OpenSuSE 10.3 and 11.0 via
the Application:/Geo repository. I won't package for OpenSuSE 10.2, except there
are many 10.2 users who complain and can't update their system :-).

http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Application:/Geo/

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster rendering difference tracked down
Message-ID: <487B66FE.2090205@amnh.org>

Tim and Marco,

Here is a little update. I have tracked down the difference in rendering 
behavior, which is causing the two units tests to fail, to revision 
8440. This was the merge into the trunk of the Render Context Branch. 
More specifically, I believe the difference has to do with the scale 
factors that are being computed in QgsMapRender.cpp.

As it is right now, I will say the test results for the landsat_basic 
looks like it has artifacts compared to the expected result in the area 
being marked as different. However, when you load the original raster 
data for the landsat_basic test and 'Zoom to best scale' the displayed 
result does not exhibit any artifacts. So I think the next logical place 
to start digging around is the QgsMapRender->setExtent() and looking 
more at the scale factors, unless anyone has other ideas.

Hi Peter,

Ok, looks like it is an issue introduced by me. I will investigate.

The raster scale factor for rendering should always be 1.0 in the main map canvas (it is different only for map composer).

Regards,
Marco

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Raster rendering difference tracked down
 
Tim and Marco,

Here is a little update. I have tracked down the difference in rendering 
behavior, which is causing the two units tests to fail, to revision 
8440. This was the merge into the trunk of the Render Context Branch. 
More specifically, I believe the difference has to do with the scale 
factors that are being computed in QgsMapRender.cpp.

As it is right now, I will say the test results for the landsat_basic 
looks like it has artifacts compared to the expected result in the area 
being marked as different. However, when you load the original raster 
data for the landsat_basic test and 'Zoom to best scale' the displayed 
result does not exhibit any artifacts. So I think the next logical place 
to start digging around is the QgsMapRender->setExtent() and looking 
more at the scale factors, unless anyone has other ideas.

Message-ID: <d368056f0807141629m4099e6b0n1ac472e2db1f9749@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks (esp grass users)

I'm doing a second round of cleanups to the grass toolbox usability
issues and to do away with some of the bugs in trac. I'd like to
propose to do :

 - make the modules list a dockwidget (see
http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlinux/2668750983/ and
http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlinux/2668750977/in/photostream/)
 - do away with the tree view altogether
 - give the grass console its own icon on the grass toolbar and remove
from the module list
 - make grass tools pop up in their own window
 - make the grass browser its own window with its own toolbar icon.
 - make the grass tool window scrollable when it has long lists of options

Any comments?

regards

Hi All

I'm systematically working through all open tickets in trac. In many
cases I will assign tickets to the person I think can handle the issue
best. Please dont think I'm being presumptuous and feel free to
decline any tickets I tag for you. I'm hoping having the tickets
assigned to more appropriate people will make it easier for devs to
find relevant things they can fix easily without having to wade
through the whole ticket queue.

Best regards

Make the grass console respect copy and paste.

On the bottom of each tool when open, put a box that shows the grass 
code that's going to be executed based on selections made on the page. 
Allow typing in this box to add command modifiers not available via the 
dialogs.

With the new search tool can you search the descriptions, what about the 
text the full help files in case you have no idea what you're looking for?

Can you also make the grass browser it's own dockwidget or window, it's 
a necessary tool that makes managing grass layers much easier and is a 
much faster way to view layer metadata before adding it to the map which 
can prevent you from adding the wrong gigantic layer to the map and then 
waiting 5 min to figure out it was the wrong one. (Brings up the idea of 
some tool that is similar to ArcCatalog for managing spatial data.)

I'll go read over the trac tickets before I speculate more.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Adrien,

You are right, the selection should be adapted when commiting features.
I think it would be difficult to map uncommited ids to commited ids (at least without changing the provider interface). So I'm also in favour of solution 1 and I'm going to apply your patch.

Regards,
Marco

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Avoid segmentation fault on selection when commit
 
Hi all,
I develop Qgis plugin and I have a little problem with selections and 
commit.
_
Steps :_

  1. You select added features (they have negative id).
  2. You commit change (commit attribute positive id to added features)
     but your mSelectedFeatureIds haven't updated and have always
     negative Id in mSelectedFeatureIds.
  3. If the user doesn't reselect features, you have a segmentation
     fault because if you do a iteration on mSelectedFeatures there are
     wrong id.


_A possible solution :

_

   * Erase all negative ids in commitChanges
     
<http://doc.qgis.org/classQgsVectorLayer.html#fab34baf331320a8c3212993f5fccfa1> 

     ()

Advantage : easy to do
Disadvantage: user's selection change when he commit

   * Provider return new id of added feature and replace in
     mSelectedFeatureIds.

Advantage :  no change for user when he commit.
Disadvantage : more change to do in code.

Ps: I attach patch of first solution.

Message-ID: <d8ad40b50807150303g49941bcfl4b2ef419eeb9ae27@mail.gmail.com>

I'm thinking of running a two-day short course on open-source geospatial
software here at Lancaster mainly directed at earth scientists. There's
three main strands: GIS, Programming, and The Web, all tied together with
info about open protocols and file formats and APIs and all that.

Now I could probably teach the whole lot but after two days I'd be dead. So
is there anyone who might be interested in teaching a session about QGIS and
then co-supervising a practical session? About an hour for each, maybe 20-30
people if we're lucky. I don't know when since I only thought this up last
week.

While I'm here if anyone would be interested in teaching the Web-based bit
I'd like to hear from you too. I'm thinking OpenLayers, a bit of Javascript
and CSS, some map service data (WFS, WMS), a bit about MapServer or
MapGuide, then another practical session so users can stick their data on
the web.

Lecturers would get expenses and a fee, plus a couple of days in Lancaster
where it's always sunny and bright. I don't think we could afford to get
anyone in from outside the UK though unless you waived your travel expenses.

Anyway, get back to me off-list if you are interested.

thanks,

Barry

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New MSYS Icon for GRASS Toolbox
Message-ID: <B954A8A0B00E49D7B51967FBB1036671@HPMarco>

Hi all,

I recently released WinGRASS-6.3.0-4 (even still not uploaded on the osgeo
server): in this release I added the JPEG support and other "minor" changes
(see
http://grass.osgeo.org/grass63/binary/mswindows/native/README.html#Binary%20Release%20History);
about these minor changes, there's one not mentioned in the list, but I
think that could be added also in the QGIS GRASS Toolbox: I created a new,
simple, icon for MSYS (IMHO, the original one, the ugliest icon ever seen);
you can see that here:
http://grass.osgeo.org/grass63/binary/mswindows/native/README.html#Launching%20GRASS;
yes, it's very simple, but IMHO it looks a little bit better, and it's very
"usable", also in small sizes.

Tell me what do you think about it.
Cheers,

Marco

Agreed the icon is not good

Which one is your suggested replacement? the 'M' Icon? Personally I
think its bad to use icons with letters on icons - I've been gradually
doing away with them in QGIS UI. People who use chinese etc
charactersets will get no meaning from letters. My preference would be
for something like the icon used in kde4 console (attached).

Best regards

Tim

Yes, I agree. The "console-like" icon is definetly better.
I created that icon to just replace the original MSYS icon used in msys.bat 
shortcuts and in rxvt.exe (manually hacked)
I choosed the simple "M" way, because when used as 16 px icon (as usual in 
MS Windows title bars) is definetely more readable than a more complicated 
(but better) graphic icon.
This said, I definetely agree that, for the GRASS Toolbox command "GRASS 
Shell", the attacched icon is a lot better; but when the command is 
launched, the msys.bat (and rxvt.exe) file is called, showing the "big M" 
icon, against the original MSYS one; just that :-)

Marco

Hi all,

I just built QGIS 0.11.0 on Windows using MinGW. It compiled fine, even if

Only the obvious ones:
 - does the source file exist?
 - does the dest dir exist?
 - do you have adequate perms to put things in the dest dir?

Not much help I know....

Hi Tim,

yes, it does

> - does the dest dir exist?

I guess the problem is the dot in 
"c:/msys/local/qgis-0.11.0/./themes/default/grass/grass_delete_map.png"

> - do you have adequate perms to put things in the dest dir?

yes, obviously

I think that something went wrong with the configure, placing a dot in the 
QGIS_DATA_DIR variable;
see also this screenshot that shows what happens when I launch qgis:

I doubt it.  The dot should be fine.  And why should it suddenly become
a problem for grass_delete_map.png, when it worked for all the other
PNGs above - even some to the same directory.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin Installer
Message-ID: <200807151941.32248.borys@wolf.most.org.pl>

Hello List,

Today I've rewieved and slightly polished the gui and improved the behaviour 
when installed plugin is invalid. Now the Installer displays an error log and 
suggests to uninstall the plugin immediatelly or contact the qgis-users list.
Furthermore, since now it recognizes when QGIS is offline and raises no more 
connection errors.

For few weeks I haven't observed any bad issues and haven't received any bug 
reports, so I think now it's enough resistant to connection errors and 
various syntax of metadata. For example, it should properly compare the 
version numbers, including all typycal prefixes, suffixes, dots, dashes, 
underlines etc. Further improvements will be implementing next to some SIP 
bindings.

If there is nobody opposed, we can put it to the SVN. But first I would like 
to ask you, could somebody take a look at the strings and correct language 
errors...? :) I'm not unerring in English, as you can see here ;) Here is the 
full list of the strings in plain text and html:

Spell check is pretty good. Grammar seemed fine to me.
uninstallation -> uninstall
omited -> omitted

All good suggestions - I'll see what is possible in the time I have. I
would suggest to file individual trac enhancement requests for these
so they are logged properly.

Tom,

My build on Leopard worked, but I have an error for Tiger.  I'm  
building on Leopard, using the 10.4 SDK to build for Tiger.

OSX 10.5.3
Xcode 3.1
Qt 4.3.5

I don't have handy access to a Tiger system with an older Xcode to see  
if it's a problem in the 10.4 the SDK. (I have one at work, but it's  
busy)  Do you still build on Tiger?  Any problems?  I might be able to  
try at work in a couple days.

Here is the error:

Hi Marco,

Are you planning to include support for SSL PostgreSQL connections in
this release?

Hi Maciej,

no, sorry. Unfortunately I planned to do that, but I had problems compiling
it, and not enough time to understand why and then fix it.
This is still an item in my to-do list; see:
http://grass.osgeo.org/wiki/WinGRASS_Current_Status#ToDo
I'm afraid. I hope to fix it during the summer.

Regards,

Marco

The QStyle::PE_PanelItemViewItem seems to be not implemented in my Qt

there is a question mark instead value. 

After commenting the problem line:

compilation runs successfully, but I get SegFault when attempt to run QGIS 
(maybe for another reason).

However, latest news say (thanks Frankie!) compiling with optimization
should be fine, provided both qgis and gdal are compiled with exactly
the same compiler.
AFAIK, it seems that ABI C++ is broken (again).

William,

Building on 10.4 for 10.4 works for me.

Your problem appears to be the same one Gary encountered back in April. It's caused by the FIND_LIBRARY ApplicationServices in the top level CMakeLists.txt. It adds -F/System/Library/Frameworks to the command line and this searches the real /System even though -isysroot is specified. It picks up a 10.5 header and then tries to find additional headers in the 10.4 sdk.

A hack fix is to add the prefix /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk to the path
APP_SERVICES_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework
in CMakeCache.txt.

An alternative hack is to replace 
FIND_LIBRARY( APP_SERVICES_LIBRARY ApplicationServices)
in the root CMakeLists.txt with
SET( APP_SERVICES_LIBRARY "-framework ApplicationServices")

The latter will bypass the find, not generate the -F/System/Library/Frameworks and simply add the -framework argument to the command line. This assumes that some sdk will always be specified.

You should have no problems if you wait until the Tiger system becomes available however either of these hacks may get your build done sooner.

Tom

I just noticed that CMake 2.4 generates the -F/System/Library/Frameworks but 2.6 doesn't. Upgrading Cmake may be the solution.

I can't verify that.   I recompiled gdal and qgis with optimization and
qgis crashes in libgdal1.  After recompiling and installing gdal without
optimization qgis starts fine (even without recompiling qgis).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WMS-Formats in QGIS 0.10.0 for Windows
Message-ID: <20080716091849.275bd537@keto>

Hi,

I found a strange problem when trying to access WMS-layers in other
formats than PNG. The server supports at least JPEG and PNG, but after
connecting to a WMS-Server, only PNG is available as a format.
Retreiving the GetCapabilities-document manual it states more
fileformats than only PNG.
The windows-version is 0.10.0 (8383) with both building an running
QT-4.3.4.

The linux-release 0.10.0 (exported, with QT 4.4.0) works as expected so
I assume that there is something wrong with the windows build only.

Can someone confirm or is this already known (and possibly fixed?) If
not, I would be happy to file a trac-ticket.


Best regards.

	Stephan

windows package does not have jpeg support (bug opened, now being closed
for 0.11), so this could explain. I do not know about png.

Paolo,

> perhaps better to put this and other issues on the qgis trac.

sure. That's just because I'm slightly learning how to manage such things, 
and as for the packager and installer scripts, I usually do the work for the 
GRASS community, I test it, and then I "move" all the "good things" also 
into the QGIS community :-)

I'll do that when I'll finished with the binary package.

I don't think the -F/System/Library/Frameworks should ever be needed.   
This is always in the default search path for frameworks (as well as / 
Library/Frameworks).  And whether or not you use the system or an SDK,  
-framework SomeSystemFramework will find it in the right place, and  
any internal includes in those frameworks will work.

And, those extra -L/System/Library/Frameowkrs and -L/Library/ 
Frameworks are pointless as well, whereever they are coming from.

So, Cmake 2.6 does it right.  It realizes that the system frameworks  
don't need -F.

wow, since a long time we now have "just" 100 critical (20) and serious
(80) bugs!
Of these, 42 are currently classified as Must fix for Release of 1.0
(but this will have to be revised, I guess):
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&groupdesc=1&group=must_fix&order=priority
May not seem all that good, but I think the trend is really encouraging.

Ok, now I can compile from trunk on Ubuntu 7.10 by omitting the

Should I assume that we will no longer support Ubuntu 7.10?

Message-ID: <487E2774.8040303@uvic.ca>

Hi all (and Martin),

Recently I was working on a plugin and wanted to use some of the 
functions added in the latest svn, only to find that there were no 
python bindings available for that function yet (it was QgisInferface's 
new addDockWidget function). Then it occurred to me, is there anywhere 
that I can look up what has and has not had bindings completed for it 
yet? If there is, great, where is it? If not, is this something that

Also, I would like to volunteer to help with the creation of python 
bindings etc (or some other related task that currently needs 
attention). Unfortunately, I don't have any real experience with this 
(just python mostly), so is there some recommended documentation that 
might help get me started?

Thanks! Works fine now. 

But there is still the second issue remaining - QGIS crashes when I'm trying 
to enable any python plugin. The C plugins works, but are disabled again 
after every QGIS start.

The solution for both problems is to change the version declaration in the 
first few lines of CMakeLists.txt back to 0.11.0 - I have no idea, what 
influence has it on python bindings?

Hi Carson,

I'm not a QGIS developer, but I have submitted a couple of patches now
that add new functions to the python bindings.  Here is what I know.

The bindings are generated with SIP, a Qt tool.  The best documentation
I've found for it is here:
http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/sip4/sipref.html  I've
found SIP fairly intimidating, and I've made the most progress by
copying examples from functions that already have a python interface.

SIP requires templates that tell it how to convert C++ functions and
classes to python and vice versa.  The code for all that lives in the
python subdirectory in subversion.   Most of that is just specifying
wrappers for QGIS classes.  The scariest part that I've run into so far
is conversions.sip, that provides wrappers for template-based types in
the QT container classes.

The other kind of weird thing is that only the stuff in the qgis core
and gui libraries have python equivalents, and not stuff in the
application itself.  For things like building an editor in python, I had
to write native python re-implementations of classes like
qgsmaptoolcapture to draw new objects in the UI.  This wasn't too hard,
but it was annoying.  I think some of that code should be moved to the
gui library...

Thanks for contributing!  (And thanks to all the QGIS developers for
that matter.)

Hi Carson

In fact when I changed the plugin interface to remove the deprecated
getToolBox and replace it with addDockWidget, I included sip interface
definitions for it too.

see python/gui/qgisinterface.sip lines 85 & 86

However I found that I needed to do a clean build before they built
again. Try remove your build dir, recreate it and build everything
again. I'm not a python programmer so other than adding the sip stub
there I havent tried it out with any python code yet - I'd be
interested to get some feedback if it works as expected or not.

Also in case it wasnt obvious the change is only in SVN trunk and not
in any released version yet (it also wont be in 0.11.0, only 1.0.0).
Thanks for the additional hints Stefanie. The division between gui and
app is was made really provide a minimal qtgui dependent library that
will support the creation of spatially enabled applications. We had to
choose realistic goals - what we have implemented thus far is the
product of nearly 6 years of work and trying to build a stable set of
pyhon libs around every class would have no doubt lengthened the
process considerably. Be assured we will carry out the planning and
design of version 2.0 of QGIS completely openly and these
considerations are something you should bring to the table when the
time comes.

Hi Borys

An issue like this was reported on IRC earlier today which I committed
a fix for (r8792) . I see Jurgen also submitted a fix. Could you
confirm if the issue still exists. Also check if qgis binary is linked
to the correct libraries (e.g. libgqgis 11 and not another version).

Regards

Hi Tim,

no, I'm talking about the "old" plugin installer and mapserver export plugin 
too. I have them built in /python/plugins but not enabled in qgis (nor I can 
see them in the plugin manager window). I think jef is working on it.

Right, my fault! It was due to the old 0.11 libraries. After removing them, 
everything works. But I still worry, why QGIS tried to use the 0.11 libs 
whereas there were links to the proper 1.0 libs.

Hi all.
I have seen http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/8798 : I think these
are very minor changes, with no potential fro breaking up other stuff,
but they are important for GRASS users. I know 0.11 is superfrozen now,
but may I ask to backport it to it anyway? Alternatively how about a
0.11.1 release? Even if 1.0 is planned to be released really soon, the
many bugs, plus the major branch merges (new printing is going to be in
1.0, right?) may delay it for a few months.
I noticed Marco Pasetti is not in the dev list: I think this must be
corrected for 0.11: his work is being precious for all those poor guys
having to deal with the infamous operating system.
All the best.

Hi all,

I still have troubles with mapserver export and plugin installer!
they are not shown in the plugin manager list nor anywhere in qgis.
this is a critical problem before to release it!!

I compiled qgis using:
Qt OpenSource (4.4.0)
Python (2.5.2)
SIP (4.7.6)
PyQt (4.4.2)
CMake (2.6.0)

the plugins have been built and installed in:
./python/plugins/mapserver_export
./python/plugins/plugin_installer

I don't have any kind of error messages launching qgis. all works fine 
(except those plugins, obviously)

this is a screenshot of the qgis regedit tree: 
http://www.webalice.it/marco.pasetti/qgis/QgisRegedit.png

while this is the qgis regedit resource:

I had the same problem on Ubuntu. QGIS 0.10 didn't see those plugins when 
there was also libraries of the 0.11 (also QGIS 1.0 didn't work properly due 
to these libraries). Now I have versions 0.10 and 1.0 installed and both 
works fine.

Maybe your problem is related to some old libraries, too?

Hi Borys,

mmm... old libs? I erased the build dir an rebuilt 0.11.0, so I should have 
any old lib, but only the 0.11.0 ones.

Hi All

I've created a branch for the GRASS revisions I am working on:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/grass-tidyup-branch

I plan to have it ready to merge into 1.0.0. Tom, in case you were
doing any qt3 -> qt4 stuff it may be better to wait or do it in that
branch.

Regards

Hi Peter, Tim and other devs

I found the reason of the failing unit test. 

It basically is because of the usage of the method QgsMapRender::setOutputSize(QSize, int dpi). 

Before the render context branch, the dpi was only used for scale calculation. It had nothing to do with the resolution of the output. And this is correct, because dpi is a property ot the Qt output device, not of QgsMapRender. The output device is already configured and has a painter on it at the time QgsMapRender::render starts its job.
 
With render context branch, the dpi situation is a bit different. There are paint devices where QPainter draws in pixel coordinates (QImage, QPixmap & co). But there is also QGraphicsScene where QPainter draws in logical coordinates (mm in case of print composer). On both types of output devices, QGIS outline width values should be mm and the raster resolution should respect the pixels of the output device. To achieve this, the outline width values are scaled with a factor when drawing to main QGIS canvas (this line scale factor is 1 for QGraphicsView and >1 for main QGIS canvas). On the other side, the rasters need to be scaled when drawing to QGraphicsView to prevent pixels with 1mm squares (this raster scale factor is 1 for QGIS main canvas). Because, as the logical units of QGraphicsView are mm, the dpi is from a vector point of view is 25.4. But the dpi of the output device is of course different. In render context branch, QgsMapRender considers the dpi value passed in the method setOutputSize to be the 'vector dpi' and looks in the QPaintDevice where QPainter is painting on for the 'raster dpi'. It then scales the raster to match the output device dpi.

Therefore, if it is not painted to QGraphicsScene (like print composer does), the dpi value passed to setOutputSize should equal the one of the paint device. And btw, if it is painted to a pixel based device and the value is different, the scale calculation will be wrong. Therefore, line 61 of qgsrenderchecker.cpp should be changed 

from
mpMapRenderer->setOutputSize( QSize ( myExpectedImage.width(),myExpectedImage.height() ),72 );

to 
mpMapRenderer->setOutputSize( QSize ( myImage.width(),myImage.height() ), myImage.logicalDpiX());

With this change, the unit raster tests will pass. I'm also going to add more documentation to QgsMapRender class so it is more clear for developers using this class.
I'm of course also open if someone has suggestions about this.

Regards,
Marco

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Raster rendering difference tracked down
 
Tim and Marco,

Here is a little update. I have tracked down the difference in rendering 
behavior, which is causing the two units tests to fail, to revision 
8440. This was the merge into the trunk of the Render Context Branch. 
More specifically, I believe the difference has to do with the scale 
factors that are being computed in QgsMapRender.cpp.

As it is right now, I will say the test results for the landsat_basic 
looks like it has artifacts compared to the expected result in the area 
being marked as different. However, when you load the original raster 
data for the landsat_basic test and 'Zoom to best scale' the displayed 
result does not exhibit any artifacts. So I think the next logical place 
to start digging around is the QgsMapRender->setExtent() and looking 
more at the scale factors, unless anyone has other ideas.

Hi Marco

Ah this sounds like it explains the issues (and kludgy workaround) I
had with quickprint too. In fact I think a large part of the code in
quickprint that tried to scale labels etc for the print device can
probably be dropped if I understand things correctly. If I understand
you correctly, where before I was doing:

  //
  // Remember the size and dpi of the maprender
  // so we can restore it properly
  //
  int myOriginalDpi = mpMapRender->outputDpi();
  //sensible default to prevent divide by zero
  if (0==myOriginalDpi) myOriginalDpi=96;
  QSize myOriginalSize = mpMapRender->outputSize();
  int mySymbolScalingAmount = myPrintResolutionDpi / myOriginalDpi;


Now I guess I can ditch : mySymbolScalingAmount and  just call:

    void setOutputSize(QSize size, int dpi);

on the maprender (passing it the print device resolution) in the same
way you are suggesting for render checker? And the maprender can be
reasonably expected to return 0 outputDpi if the render mode is to a
graphics scene?

Also it would be interesting to roll back the control image changes I
made for the vector rendering checks and see if they pass with your
suggested change to renderchecker (I felt I was cheating a little bit
changing the expected output to make the vector tests pass :-P ).

Regards

Tim

We should rather release 0.11.1 - changing the source after we send
out the call for packaging is a bad idea - for one thing we'll never
know what people actually had on their system when they report bugs
etc.

In my opinion we should also change the grass modules approach to be
more like qgis plugins - with an online repository that users can
dynamically update modules. Release versions can give a current set of
modules and the user can mask them with newer versions in their home
dir. This is especially in the light of the fact that modules are
dynamic and require no compilation, we may as well take advantage of
Radims great approach to GRASS tools. Something to think about for the
future....

Alternatively how about a
> 0.11.1 release?

Yes we can do this but lets get 0.11.0 out first. But it should be off
the same 0.11.0 branch and only backport selectively things to go into
it.

 Even if 1.0 is planned to be released really soon, the

Which dev list? We actually need a maintainer for the dev and sponsors
list - I think I 'volunteered you' for the SPONSORS list recently in a
mail about the release checklist, I will try to get one of our release
team folks to look after the dev and contributors lists too.

Hi Tim,

Yes, there should be no need to do scaling yourself in quickprint plugin. QgsMapRender is intended to look at the resolution and convert outline width, symbol sizes and labels automatically. But the units for all this is mm now where it was pixel before, so it will look different with the same settings. Therefore I'm not sure if reverting the control images will work.

>And the maprender can be
>reasonably expected to return 0 outputDpi if the render mode is to a
>graphics scene?

QgsMapRender just gives back the dpi value you entered in setOutputSize (via mScaleCalculator):

void QgsMapRender::setOutputSize(QSize size, int dpi)
{
  mSize = size;
  mScaleCalculator->setDpi(dpi);
  adjustExtentToSize();
}
int QgsMapRender::outputDpi()
{
  return mScaleCalculator->dpi();
}

Regards,
Marco

I've built packages for Fedora 8, 9, and 10.  I dropped the ball on the 0.10.0 
release (it's still on in Fedora 8 or 9), so I hope to get 0.11.0 in as soon 
as it comes out.

You can find my packages here:
http://www.silfreed.net/download/repo/packages/qgis/

I'm having problems building qgis for Fedora 8 and 9 on i386 (but not x86_64); 
I'm getting errors like this during the install:

/usr/lib/atlas/liblapack.so.3: undefined reference to `ATL_sspr2'

Full pastebin is here:
http://pastebin.ca/1074716

Any help here would be appreciated.

But the units for all this is mm now where it was pixel before, so it will look different with the same settings. Therefore I'm not sure if reverting the control images will work.

Ok no problem I'll leave them as is.

In the case of quickprint I was doing (in pseudocode)
mapcanvas->getMapRenderer from the screen display canvas and then
repurposing the renderer to do the printing. After printing I was
reinstating the original mapcanvas settings. I guess with the
mapcomposer stuff I wont need to use this slightly kludgy way and can
create a unique maprenderer and then discard it after printing? I'll
probably just leave the quickprint alone until your composer stuff
comes in - I'm looking forward to trying it out!

Regards

Tim

>> Hi Peter, Tim and other devs

>> I found the reason of the failing unit test.
>>
>> It basically is because of the usage of the method QgsMapRender::setOutputSize(QSize, int dpi).
>>
>> Before the render context branch, the dpi was only used for scale calculation. It had nothing to do with the resolution of the output. And this is correct, because dpi is a property ot the Qt output device, not of QgsMapRender. The output device is already configured and has a painter on it at the time QgsMapRender::render starts its job.
>>
>> With render context branch, the dpi situation is a bit different. There are paint devices where QPainter draws in pixel coordinates (QImage, QPixmap & co). But there is also QGraphicsScene where QPainter draws in logical coordinates (mm in case of print composer). On both types of output devices, QGIS outline width values should be mm and the raster resolution should respect the pixels of the output device. To achieve this, the outline width values are scaled with a factor when drawing to main QGIS canvas (this line scale factor is 1 for QGraphicsView and >1 for main QGIS canvas). On the other side, the rasters need to be scaled when drawing to QGraphicsView to prevent pixels with 1mm squares (this raster scale factor is 1 for QGIS main canvas). Because, as the logical units of QGraphicsView are mm, the dpi is from a vector point of view is 25.4. But the dpi of the output device is of course different. In render context branch, QgsMapRender considers the dpi value passed in the method setOutputSize to be the 'vector dpi' and looks in the QPaintDevice where QPainter is painting on for the 'raster dpi'. It then scales the raster to match the output device dpi.
>>
>> Therefore, if it is not painted to QGraphicsScene (like print composer does), the dpi value passed to setOutputSize should equal the one of the paint device. And btw, if it is painted to a pixel based device and the value is different, the scale calculation will be wrong. Therefore, line 61 of qgsrenderchecker.cpp should be changed

My OSX framework builds are good to go.  Just need packaging.  I'm  
operating a bit slow this week - heat, Qgis/GRASS/MapServer all busy.   
But should be ready by Monday release day.

Message-ID: <94b8ae6d0807172130r37ddc4cdq3f8b2813a0b83ba0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

                    i have compiled and installed Qgis on SUSE 10.3. i
compiled a simple QGIS application given in the following website:

http://blog.qgis.org/?q=node/10. The application got compiled,but when i
run,the map is not getting displayed. i have another system with SUSE
10.1,and also i had compiled and installed ,qgis. there teh same application
opens successfully and map is displayed. i checked the gcc version of the
two versions and found that 10.1 contains 4.1.0-25 and 10.3 contains
4.2.0.will this be the cause for the map not being displayed.

Has anyone faced this kind of problem before ? if so can you suggest me the
solution for this ?

with regards,
saravanan.

I meant the list of developers on the "About" window of the program.
Did you volunteer me? Sorry, I missed this ;)
Just let me know.

No. Most of it was achieved by moving the milestone to 1.0. Most of the
bugs in 1.0 are still the old good ones known from < 0.11.

The about box is generated from the AITHORS text file - once Marco has
been given SVN access should be added to the AUTHORS file.

Tim,

sure, thanks.

PS: John will put the last Metis installer (after final testings on GPS 
Babel) into a place where you can grab it from.

Hi

True but lets not forget the ~ 70 or so tickets tgat were closed this
release...cup half full and all that...

Once 1.0.0 goes out we will pretty much be in perpetual feature freeze
(well at the very least the public api ) and all 1.x.x releases will
be far more bug fix focused.

regards

Tim

Message-ID: <1216396403.6375.32.camel@galadriel>

Hello all, 

this week I began reorganizing the code.
I throwed out MCP interface, because it is the same of kernel interface,
except for two missing widgets.
I'm trying to do the same with other pieces of code, and so far I'm 
succeeding.

"The Art of UNIX Programming" is teaching me _a lot_.

Next week I'll going on with this work. I hope to implement also
kernel analysis.

I'm also thinking about documentation. What format is required to 
document Python plugins? Is there a template?

happy coding,

Anne Ghisla

Yes,

but I was actually referring to specific Windows still opened bugs:

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=new&status=reopened&platform=Windows&milestone=Version+1.0.0&type=bug&order=priority

the list was much longer just before 0.11.0 release :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Should QGIS use generic names for raster bands
Message-ID: <4880BBC7.7090905@amnh.org>

Howdy devs.

A comment on the recent ticket has gotten me thinking. Should QGIS use 
generic names (i.e., Band 1, Band 2 etc) rather than using the band 
names stored in the raster file itself?

Take these two geotiffs. They are the same data (Landsat band 1,2,3,4,5, 
and 7 in that order) but were created with two different applications. 
Here are the band names as reported by GDAL

GeoTiff_ENVI:
Band 1 Block=256x1 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Red
Band 2 Block=256x1 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Green
Band 3 Block=256x1 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Blue
Band 4 Block=256x1 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Alpha
Band 5 Block=256x1 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Undefined
Band 6 Block=256x1 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Undefined

GeoTiff_ERDAS
Band 1 Block=256x32 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Gray
Band 2 Block=256x32 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Undefined
Band 3 Block=256x32 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Undefined
Band 4 Block=256x32 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Undefined
Band 5 Block=256x32 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Undefined
Band 6 Block=256x32 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Undefined


So,
1) Displaying undefined in the pull down menu for a band name does not 
seem very useful to me
2) The user/application that created the raster file can change the name 
of the bands and they may not be accurate. In the GeoTiff_ENVI example, 
Band 1 is Landsat Band 1 which is actually the blue band. This could be 
confusing to newer users
3) In the GeoTiff_ERDAS example, if you wanted a true color combination, 
your pulldowns would display R= 3: Undefined G=2: Undefined B=1: Gray. 
Again, the band names from the raster file are not very useful.

If we are to go with generic band names, I will not be winning any 
popularity contests with the users because the band name is stored in 
the project file rather than just the band number. While it may seem 
trivial, I think that this is actually a very important decision as we 
move toward trying to get version 1.0 out.

Any thoughts?

Message-ID: <BAY110-W44D22BA174A2AAC0F6F903B2890@phx.gbl>

Hi developers:
 
I have successfully compiled qgis core,gui and ogr provider for 
windows mobile 5 using visual studio but I have two problems
for some reason the dlls dissapear when copied to windows mobile
emulator or device and qgis is unable to load the providers
I tried to change the extension of dlls but providers are not 
loaded. Any ideas to check why are not being loaded?
 
The other problem is with debug messages should I create
some changes to QgsLogger to allow log to a file or the 
functionality is already there? or any other idea to see
debug messages?

Marco,

I have tried and cannot get qgis to read data from my gps unit without  
cajoling the device settings into working. Basically, I have to edit  
my device and put the gpsbabel command into the device setting because  
%in and %out strings are not working correctly.

For example, to get a waypoint layer loaded from the GPS device, I  
have to click on the device settings, go to waypoint download and make  
the line look like this:
%babel -i garmin -o gpx -f com4 -F "C:\Documents and Settings\User Name 
\Desktop\test.gpx"
You have to hit "update device" to get this setting to stick.

Then I have to fill in the "Save as" box in the main GPS tools dialog  
with the path to the above test.gpx file. I tell qgis to call the new  
layer "test".

This works for loading the waypoint data from the device. You have to  
similarly create the path (hard code it in the device settings) to the  
gpx file for uploads and downloads to a gps device. This is not at all  
ideal.

I think we need a developer with GPS hardware to work out the kinks in  
the GPS Tools plugin, because there are clearly some issues. I have to  
do some hard coding of the device in OS X, but paths to files are  
working there. It is not ideal, but this is how the GPS Tool has  
functioned for me in OS X as long as I can remember. I've never tried  
in Windows before.

Possibly, this functionality can be tested with an emulator. A search  
brought up gpsgate, but not free. There is a 14-day trial. http://GpsGate.com/index.php?id=13

Let me know if this installer should be considered complete. My  
thinking is the GPS Tools is a broader issue, needs to be filed as a

Which still doesn't have to mean that so many Windows specific bugs have
been just fixed. Mind that in the recent testing of "Windows" some of
them were assigned to "All" operating systems (I have done this for
several tickets myself, when could reproduce the bug on GNU/Linux too).
So these bugs still apply to Windows *and* other OS's too. E.g.:

#1092, #1071, #584

I think generic names would be better.

Did you try to start qgis using the debugger?   That might catch the
debug output - at least it does on Windows.

Hi

Just a note on your PS, we have no policy on this list regarding top
or bottom posting - and for good reason since the issue incites debate
akin to vim vs emacs. Use which ever approach you prefer without any
expectation that others will follow suite.

regards

Hi

I agree with Maciej - users always have the option of looking in the
metadata to match generic names against metadata.

WOW!

I just booted up William's mac binary and am VERY impressed with the  
excellent user interface improvements.

Thanks to all those who thought through these advances!

Holy #$&*%

Can't help but also mention that the ability to double-click any  
shapefile on from the system finder and have it open in QGIS, well  
Rocks!.

And the improvements in the symbolizer are absolutely fantastic...  
decimal line widths, nice icons oh ya.

Cheers,

Dane

I think it's been able to do that for a while.  0.9 maybe?

AFAICT, Previously one could only open one file from the filesystem.  
Later attempts would not load as new layers. Now the application can  
be open with existing layers and double-clicking a new file will still  
open it within the application.

Qgis' own documentation (from Help... Help Contents) is just some html in
the Qgis doc folder. What we could do is standardize on something like that
for plugins - have a doc folder in each plugin with an index.html file and
then whatever other documentation can be put and linked from there.

Carson Farmer's ftools plugin has an 'About' menu option that gives a dialog
with a 'Web' button that heads off to the internet to get the documentation
for fTools. This could be easily modified to get the documentation from
$MYPLUGINDIR/doc to avoid relying on a network connection.

Hi

One thing I noticed with plugins with 'about' menu optiond is they
they tend to leave these behind as orphans if you disable the plugin
using plugin manager.

Something to consider in your homerange implementation any way....

Fine. If you think that such a practice doesn't hamper information flow 
do as you wish.

Just that you don't feel alone in this:

1. I also find it easier to follow when people properly trim their
   replies, just quote what they refer to and then put their responses
   below those references.

2. Last time I brought this up Tim also pointed me to the no policy

That's a Qt file.  dpkg -S qprinterinfo.h on Debian unstable tells me,
that it's in the libqt4-dev package:

libqt4-dev: /usr/include/qt4/QtGui/qprinterinfo.h
libqt4-dev: /usr/include/qt4/Qt/qprinterinfo.h

No idea why PyQt doesn't pick it up on your machine.

on windows mail top posting is the default; I always try to avoid top

Even worse: Some people are even forced to use Outlook, although they
would use something else otherwise.

Good move. Thanks.

Sure, I'm not blaming anyone.  I'm just saying that I appreciate
"traditional" replies - and that it's not just about the order.

Hi Peter,

I also prefer generic names.

In my opinion, technical decisions should have priority over project file 
compatibility issues.
And there is the possibility to write some code to transform project files to 
new version (see the project file transformation framework provided by Magnus 
in qgsprojectfiletransform.cpp/h). There you could write a new method 
(transform0110to1000), iterate over the raster layers and transform the band 
names to band numbers.

Regards,
Marco

It's ready to put it to the trunk! I implement some minor changes from time to 
time, while it is still "open", but they aren't necessary.

I'm going to implement two more improvements after adding the missing SIP 
bindings:
- load/reload/unload plugins directly from the Installer
- replace current table view with a Manager-like list view

but  I think we can add it later (I won't find any time for learning SIP any 
day now), whereas the whole Installer should get a longer testing period 
before 1.0 release. So it's ready for the trunk.

It is possible to let QgsLogger print to a file by redirecting to console:

I confirm: it worked.
It would be time to update the package, but possibly we can go straight
to 0.11.

Thanks Marco. There was actually an easy way to incorporate this right 
into right into the QgsRasterLayer so it will transform to the new name 
on the fly. Everyone's project files and qml files should work just fine.

Howdy devs,

All static path related calls to QgsApplication are coming back empty. 
The initial instantiation is ok, but after that something goes wrong. I 
noticed it when the icon on the raster properties window were not 
showing up, but icons are missing in a number of other areas as well 
(legend menu, theme list in the options panel etc).

I took a quick look around but nothing jumped out at me.

Hi Peter

I had this problem a little while back too. Try checking your qgis
binary is linked to the correct libs using ldd. Also try removing any
other (e.g. Apt based) installs of qgis. I have yet to discoveer the
underlying cause...though when I investigated it seemed to be
triggered inside the qgis python init code.

regards Tim

Hi list,

Hummm...
I am using the deb repository 
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/qgis/ubuntu hardy main
from which I installed 0.10.

Today, coming back to my work computer, Ubuntu proposed me to installed the
new version of Qgis.
So I did it. :D
Now, I have 0.11.0 Metis working.

I have the same probllem : 
* now none of my python plugins are loaded (no errors though)
* No plugin "plugin installer" available

Should I completely uninstall Qgis then reinstall it or should I do
something else ?

NB:
I get this message when loading qgis
Debug: 
**********************************
Debug: QgsApplication state:

Python support is optional as is GRASS.

Hi all.
Recently I noticed that when qgis (0.10 on deb) queries the db (to load
geometries) often postgres takes up a very large amount of CPU, for many
minutes. I once had even to kill the process. Does this happens to
others? We never noticed it before.
All the best.

Hi all.
AFAIK, C++ API support was recently removed by FrankW in favour of the
more stable C support. This should have removed the need of recompiling
qgis+gdal at every new version, but this does not appear the case (in
deb, for instance, qgis crashes at startup with new gdal, unless one
recompiles it without optimization). Am I missing something? Or did C++
interface crept in sometimes?
All the best.

That's just the GDAL API.  We still use the GEOS C++ API.

I don't think the GDAL issue is a ABI problem.  The ABI shouldn't change
if you compile with or without optimization.  And should also only be a
problem when you mix binaries produced by different compiler (versions).

I suspect that this is a more general GCC 4.3 optimization problem -
IIRC Debian also currently compiles mapserver w/o optimization on GCC
4.3, because of that.

BTW did you verify that on platforms other than amd64?

Thanks Tim. So it did turn out to be a library related issue.  I was not 
currently building the python bindings but there was an old symlink 
still pointing to a 0.11.0 python library. Cleaned out /usr/local/lib 
and everything is fine.

Hi all.
Further tests on a different db confirmed the problem.
Anybody confirms? If there are tests to be done, I'm willing to help.

Hi Borys

Great to hear the new plugin manager is ready! We just need to decide
how we are going to deal with shipping python plugins with QGIS. Some
issues:

 - where do we put it in svn tree
 - where do we install it to
 - assuming we install to a sys dir e.g. under /usr/... , do we plan
to mask out sys plugins if the same plugin is installes in users home
dir
 - assuming yes above, do we give version precedence to newer versions
regardless of location


Probably there are more issues we should also consider. Martin would
be the right person to manage this integration process but I'm not
sure when he will be back in hack mode.

regards

Hi

Did you have to kill the QGIS process or pg? I haven't had any similar
issues myself - but I guess a large part of this depends on your db
schema too. Is this a regression -did older QGIS versions do the same
quey without issue?

 I just hit a problem with the plugin manager - lack of http proxy support!

 The QHttp methods used will only use a proxy if explicitly told. From
campus all web traffic goes via a proxy, and most applications will
look at the http_proxy environment variable and use that, but QHttp
doesn't. You need to set it explicitly with:

    proxy = QNetworkProxy(QNetworkProxy.HttpProxy, proxyHost, proxyPort)
    qhttpObject.setProxy(proxy)

It's a bit more complicated if you have an authenticating proxy that
needs a username and password, of course.

 I wonder if it would be better dealt with in the Qgis core, so that
individual plugins didn't have to deal with it. It's also complicated
by cross-platform issues - the documentation for python's built-in
urllib web-fetcher says it can get proxy info from the Windows
registry or Mac's Internet Settings. Actually there's a lot of useful
stuff in urllib relating to proxies...

 So really it's something that ought to be in Qt... Weird that it
isn't.  Or have I totally missed something?

Hi

I added global proxy support in qgis options dialog for 0.11 - does
this not work for plugins too? In theory it should...

 The plugin installer builds its own QHttp object, so it's not using
the QgsHttpTransaction stuff in the core that I guess you are talking
about. Hence the proxy isn't set. QHttp needs the proxy set for each
QHttp object, there's no global settings (as far as I can see).

 I suppose if the QgsHttpTransaction stuff is exposed to python then
that would be the way to go for asynchronous http transfers.

 I've only got 0.10.0 at the moment so can't test it anyway :)

That is what QGIS does now. It is simple and sufficient for upgrading the 
plugins, as I think. So just replacing the old installer will be big 
advantage with low effort.

I wondered about this. I think it would be nice, but is not necessary if we 
can keep the main repo up to date. Finally, there are only two plugins in the 
sys location and a lot of other things to do for 1.0 ;)

But if you want this functionality, I've wrote a version compare function in 
Python (I haven't found nothing appropriate), so we can use this idea in 
qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp.

Unfortunatelly, he told something about two months...

Ops, I don't use proxy, so I forgot about it. Will it be sufficent if I set 
the proxy configuration with the QHttp.setProxy method? 
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qhttp.html#setProxy

I'll put the upgraded version in ten minutes.

Ok, proxy connections should now work with QGIS >= 0.11

I've just switched it from urllib to Qt... ;)) But I hope everything works 
now. Please confirm if it works for you too

Hi

In theorry you should need to make no changes since I used
QNetworkProxy::setApplicationProxy which should apply globay to all
parts of the applicatio. However I've not tested to see if this
carries accross the plugin / app boundary.

regards

Tim

You're right! My last upgrade was redundant, proxy works without that. 
Barry's problem was just due to the 0.10 version... So I'm bringing it back.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CMake configure changes for MinGW
Message-ID: <90F9C45FB1FE46A7AA8C6CE44A9AE207@HPMarco>

Hi all,

I would like to introduce some changes into the CMake default configuration 
for MinGW, to reflect the "structure" of the QGIS_MSYS_Environment.zip I 
currently provide (see: 
http://www.webalice.it/marco.pasetti/qgis+grass/BuildFromSource.html#Quantum%20GIS). I 
always used CMake with its GUI, but I would like to learn how to write the 
config files (CMakeLists, right?) to let qgis be correctly configured with 
the current provided MSYS Environment, thus without the need of further 
CMake "lines hacking". Where can I find documentation about that?

Regards,

Marco

Hi,
the Installer inserts its item to the plugin menu at second position (between 
the Manager and the separator), but then other plugins are inserted at 
positions 2-end in alphabetical order, moving the Installer and the separator 
down. It brokes the order and looks bad.

My suggestion is to insert plugins at positions 3-end instead of 2-end. The 
first two positions will be always either "manager,separator" 
or "manager,installer", and the separator will be always on the top of order, 
so it's safe and stable. Could we apply this very small change?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] grass database
Message-ID: <4885C3AC.3020309@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
While testing grass modules, I noticed some weird thing.
To connect to a pg database, the user apparently must:
- run db.connect(.schema) giving:
Driver name (pg)
Database name
"host=faunalia.it,dbname=database_name" (with comma and maybe quotes)
nameoftheschema
- run db.login giving
Database name
host=faunalia.it dbname=prova_leo (with space, no comma, no quotes)
username
password
This seems a bit more complicated than necessary. I suggest:
- to have consistent syntax
- to put each variable in a different space, separating host and db_name
- to merge the two modules into one, so user must enter Driver name,
host, dbname only once.
If everybody agrees, the change should be simple to do.
I'm filling a ticket for this.
All the best.

I think this is an excellent idea, and I have started to implement this in
all my current plugins. They will slowly be updated to reflect this menu
behavior.

Wait... What Idea? I hope you're not going to put all your plugins together at 
the second position ;) 

I was talking about changing the QgisApp::getPluginMenu (that is indirectly 
QgisApp::addPluginMenu) method only.

Message-ID: <958244340807230303l343816aakc38e66bda41fce45@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Godofredo,

A colleague of mine has just pointed me towards your email, I'm hoping
that I can persuade you to think about developing qgis for the
Openmoko platform rather than windows mobile :)

The specifications for the FreeRunner phone, the first mass market
release of an Openmoko device, are very high:

http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Freerunner

It's the screen that really wins it for me: 480x640 @ 285 dpi. Simply
put it's beautiful, and you can get a lot of GIS on there! There are
other reasons why a lot of people think it's the best mobile platform
currently available:

http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Why_Openmoko

Currently the Openmoko platform runs a GTK based stack, although QT is
installable. In the near future this will be replaced by the so-called
ASU release which runs QT by default.

SqLite is already available for Openmoko; I compiled PROJ.4 yesterday
and made some progress towards getting GEOS to work.

I work for Oxford Archaeology and we are very keen on developing
mobile GIS applications. We have already provided hardware so that
gvSIG mobile can be developed on the Openmoko platform:

http://gvsigmobileonopenmoko.wordpress.com/

My blog contains more information about our plans for this device and
why we think it's so perfect for a wide range of uses:

http://blogs.thehumanjourney.net/finds/category/OLPA

Please get in contact if you would like to discuss anything with
regard to the Openmoko platform.

All the best,

Joseph




Hi:

I will try to compile the qgis api for windows mobile 5.
I have managed to compile most of dependencies:

gdal
sqlite
geos
proj

But now I found a problem, cmake does not have targets
for windows mobile platform. I have seen two possible options
one of them is generate qmake files for the api and the other
is to create the visual stuido project directly.

what could be the best option? or should I try to generate a new
platform target for cmake?

If the last is a good idea, any ideas to generate the platform
target?

Regards

I think you really need a proper GIS to preview whether your mapfile
returns what you need, so I think the qgis approach is a winning one.
Please note that the current approach is light and fast, as it is based
on a standalone tool in python (so easy to maintain and change as
mapfile syntax changes) who takes a qgis project and converts it in a
mapfile.
I think in the long term a nicer approach would be to use a standard
description for both qgis and mapserver (possibly other projects also),
with additional tags used for desktop gis and invisible to mapserver, so
no conversions would be necessary. SLD might be a good approach in this
sense.
All the best.

Message-ID: <1216828956.13609.16.camel@galadriel>

Hi all,

first of all, sorry for delay in posting the weekly report! I noticed
only today that I missed reporting last week's update. 

I worked on refactorisation and fought against segfaults.
The two Python files have been pasted together into plugin.py, with
improved compactness. Some other changes are leading the analysis to
independence of my installation's details.
The segfault was caused by a type mismatch. The call to R in:

r.source(file)

was receiving a QString instead a Python string. I fixed it with proper
formatting of file variable before using it.

In these two days I'll go on cleaning the code. I hope to have a
full-running plugin at the end of next week. Then, testing on various
platforms will be precious (especially Mac).

Happy coding,

Anne

No high ASCII here ;)
More testing: it fails apparently with everything on Desktop
It appears rather random, as it failed once even on /home/Documenti.
Now with /home/Documenti/AAA-verificare/ qgsis freezes, and on the shell
I find:

Debug:
/home/paolo/Desktop/build/qgis-0.10.0/src/core/qgsvectorlayer.cpp: 148:

 *** caught segfault ***

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace

So it may be related to manageR?
Hope it helps.

checked in my new build.
QGIS v0.11 is able to open the file (congratulations).
But when I open it in QGIS v0.11, I see a memory hit of 1.2GB, around 
13x the size of the file.
I am pleased that I am know able to view this file in QGIS, but this 
memory usage does limit the other layers I can add.
Just thought I would mention this for information to those working on 
this aspect of QGIS - is this known behavior?

This is probably due to upgrading from Qt3 to Qt4 table classes.

I would expect at hit of at least 3x to 4x. 13x seems a bit high but not totally unexpected since we are using generic table classes.

A custom data storage class can be written for Qt4 tables. It appears that this would be worthwhile for large files.

Another possible optimization for Qt4 tables is to load only the data visible on the screen. This can only be done for formats which support random access, however. SHP files qualify but other QGIS formats do not. If we go this route, we then need to maintain two table data storage classes: one for formats which support random access and another for formats which don't.

I removed the Qt3 classes so that QGIS can be built as a 64bit Mac application. After QGIS 1.0, the QGIS community should compare and prioritize this and other optimizations and new features for QGIS.

Hi Joseph & Godofredo

Regarding this thread, I am wondering how practical it is to do an 'as
is' port to these small form factor devices. Surely it would be better
to:

 - identify which features you would require
 - create a trimmed down user interface using libqgis_core & libqgis_gui

We could support such a minimalist UI within SVN itself (e.g.
src/lite) and have a cmake directive to either compile the 'fat'
application of the 'lite' one. On the desktop platform I have already
been involved in making a few 'lite' QGIS applications that use the
core QGIS, a couple of plugins and maptools. Its not difficult to do
and would probably make using QGIS on such a device a more palatable
experience.

Is there any possibility of obtaining a development Openmoko unit
running Qt4 for the QGIS project? Perhaps there is a software only
emulator? If so I would be interested in taking a deeper look...

Regards

Tim

Hi Tom

Using qt4's 'interview (model/view)' framework is probably a good way
to go here too. I believe the provider api has the necessary methods
to allow us to implement this. Martin has made an experimental python
of this once (perhaps its used in 'BetterTable' python plugin?) and I
have a halfway implemented C++ model implemented somewhere on my hard
disk. In other applications I have found that using model / view
implementation offers a significant performance benifit aside from
memory usage considerations.

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <d368056f0807250242v5c2d2216nb5ef2bd53613f3c6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

With the release of 0.11.0 mostly behind us, here is the abridged
proposed timeline for releasing 1.0.0:

Three weeks before - feature freeze  : 25 August 2008
Two weeks before - call for translations : 1 September 2008
One week before - branch & call for packaging : 8 September 2008
Day of release : 15 September 2008

Please note that as always with a release events may cause delays in
the release program, so consider these dates a working guide, not a
contract cast in stone.

Focus for the release (that I am aware of):
 - complete port to Qt4 and remove Qt3Support dependencies (pretty
much just GRASS) - Tim (may need help for the raster calculator)
 - rewrite of labelling - Martin???
 - merge of map composer branch - Marco
 - menu overhaul - Tom
 - final checkthrough of core and gui API
 - merge of generica database access - Godofrodo (is this still on the
table for 1.0?)
 - complete update and editorial review of user manual (community team)
 - complete update of QGIS web site (community team - is this doable
to coincide with 1.0?)
 - anything else (other than obviously bug fixing)??

In between getting 1.0.0 we shall try to make a 0.11.1 bugfix release
in the coming week or two, mainly to merge in any 'missed the boat'
fixes from the 0.11.0 release.

I have set up a new release checklist for 1.0.0 here:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist1.0 - I encourage you to
subscribe to that page if you would like to keep informed on the
release program progress.

Finally please note that the above url is using the new colour coded
checklist - I've assigned various task to various people - please take
a look there and let me know if you have any issue with the things I
put your name against. This applies to  Tim Sutton, Marco Hugentobler,
Otto Dassau, Anne Ghisla, Richard Duivenvoorde, Maning, Paolo
Cavallini, Release team all


Best regards and happy hacking!

This is exactly what I was thinking; I think that we would benefit
most from using a mobile qgis application for data viewing and very
simple editing with the appropriate UI elements adjusted to fit the
screen size and layout.

This sounds great.

Supplying you with Openmoko hardware is certainly a possibility and
I'm sure we would be happy to support QGIS in this way. Software
options are also available; there's the toolchain for porting single
apps or the whole environment can be emulated:

Great I'm going to take a look at these resources. At the moment I am
focussing on getting things ready for QGIS 1.0.0 and I will do some
work on 'lite' version after that if someone hasnt beaten me to it.

Oggetto: [DebianGIS] Qgis: who's who?
Data: Fri, 25 Jul 2008 10:40:57 +0200
Da: Francesco P. Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>
A: pkg-grass-general@lists.alioth.debian.org

Still no news from people interested in supporting Qgis in Debian.
But for having a debian/ upstream tree we need basically:

 1. Reviewing of that tree in respect with comments by ftpmasters
    && 3.8.0 policy && best practices.
 2. One or more people in charge in order to follow both upstream
    development AND Debian policy and modify the debian/ tree as
    required; follow multi-arch building; providing patches;
    etc.

Even if I could perform (1) currently, I will not do it until
other people will not promote officially themselves for (2) and
work on the alioth debian tree, updating it as needed and
generally taking in charge under the eyes of the world the challenge.
Qgis had already in the past a bad mantainance history, we should
avoid a third round like that. Of course, I'm available for sponsoring
uploads when required.

What specifically does he mean by this? And what were rounds 1 and 2?

Sounds great. The only thing I find sorely missing is support for
modules with multiple map input options in the GRASS tools.
This currently prevents some good tools like v.patch from moving
into the GRASS tools GUI. I don't know how hard this would be, but
I imagine it just boils down to providing a simple widget that allows
input of more than one map.

Best,

Benjamin

Hi Benjamin

I'm in the process of revising the GRASS plugin in a separate branch
- I'll see what I can do. Have you filed a ticket for this already?

I cleaned the debian/changelog upstream and what I added is to the best
of my knowledge.  I work on unstable and try to keep the debian/ branch
uptodate as I use it to build qgis.

It would be nice to know, if there's still something wrong.

You also mentioned GRASS regressions before, but never really told us
what they were.

The upstream debian/ tree reflects the little I know about the Debian
policy.  So I'm probably not qualified to do that either.

Where can I read up on that?

I absolutely agree. In trunk there's a commit of some changes I introduced 
in the GRASS toolbox to fix the multiple layers problem... but it's only a 
workaround, we better need a consistent hack of the GRASS toolbox code to 
let GRASS modules work with multiple layers input in it.

Hi C.
I have a very long filename:
fix_uso_modello_random_tutti_anni_grass.shp
could it be a reason?

In  /home/paolo/Desktop/Lia_GRASS/ as well as in
/home/paolo/Desktop/Christopher/ it does not work, in
/home/paolo/Desktop/ it does.

I press on Browse, then up a folder, but Choose is unactivated. I have
to select the folder to be able to choose the folder.
If I remember correctly, I could select the folder I was into, without
the need to go up one level and click on the folder name (two extra
clicks required, potentially confusing). But it's obviously a very minor
thing.
If I select a subfoder respect to the one I was trying (unsuccessfully)
to split mt vector before, qgis freezes and on the shell I get:

Debug:
/home/paolo/Desktop/build/qgis-0.10.0/src/core/qgsvectorlayer.cpp: 148:
(~QgsVectorLayer) In QgsVectorLayer destructor

 *** caught segfault ***
address 0xfffffffe71531290, cause 'memory not mapped'

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace

I select 3, then qgis exits and:

Exception thread.error: 'release unlocked lock' in <class
'thread.error'> ignored

Sorry I cannot be more helpful.
All the best.

Just be aware I am making many changes to GRASS in
grass-tidyup-branch, so if you are doing any work with GRASS, you may
want to do it in that branch too.

I just submitted it as an enhancement.
Thanks a lot for looking into this.

Hi Joseph and Tim:

In the next days I will be setting up a machine to start 
building qgis dependencies. 

Tim one question, using cmake will require to create
a new target platform, do you know where I can find 
some information about?

Joseph do you know wich of the dependencies are 
already ported? the list is the following:

sqlite
geos
proj
gdal

Hi all, 

in these two days I did a little more work on reducing length of code.
The interface will soon be a unique .py file, called in different
flavors.
Next week I will freeze interface and go on activating functionalities.

happy coding!

Yes, I think it is quite likely that this is the reason. Judging from your
description above (works for shorter paths, not longer ones), it sounds
like the output names are getting too long. The plugin takes the layer
name plus the attribute name to create a new layer name: this would
produce an extremely long file name, which may be too long for the
shapefile writer. Maybe try exporting the layer to a new shapefile, giving
it a shorter name, and try again? Let me know what happens.

I thought this was always the case? I'm not sure why this would have
changed? It way be that we are stuck with this behaviour, but I'll see if
you can get it back to the way you describe it...

Hmmm, this behavior is odd, and not good. I'll try to produce the same
errors here.

No - I did a little google searching but didnt turn up much. I guess
from the openmoko side of things it would be nice to get a 'guru' who
can help with platform specific issues so we could focus more on
building the QGIS lite implementation.

Since a detached dock can't be pushed behind another window, it's size should be closer to a toolbar rather then a window. The icons and explanation box should be optional so that the dock can show just the module names; essentially it would be a text toolbar of module names.

If there is some way to detatch it as a regular window, the current layout is fine. If not, I prefer either a minimalist dock of module names or the current design where the Toolbox command crates a regular window.

>  - do away with the tree view altogether

I like hierarchy though I'm not sure I need the current tree view. Using the dots in the module names might be good enough to create a tree. I prefer the tree over the filter because I prefer to explore by mouse rather then keyboard.

This is ok. Right now the console is appearing as a dock which is not ok. The console should be in a window which can be pushed behind.

>  - make grass tools pop up in their own window
>  - make the grass browser its own window with its own toolbar icon.

ok as long as these are real windows and not docks.

> Any comments?

In general, putting things into separate windows is fine. Too many docks however feel like popup advertisements in browsers. They steal or cover map space and you have to actively work to keep them out of the way.

My preferred work style is to have a variety of windows mostly behind my main window. They stick out of all sides somewhat like tabs. I click a window to bring it forward, do something, and send it behind again.

Docks vs windows, trees vs. filters, tabs in windows vs. multiple windows. Different folk have different preferences. Rather then having to choose, we should investigate how to provide both. Perhaps I'm reacting too soon but the dock approach doesn't feel right for me.

Sounds great!

Sqlite is already provided within the Openmoko repos, I've ported proj
using the toolchain. I can send you the produced pkg file on monday,
although it really was just a 5 minute job to get it working. That
just leaves geos & gdal.

I'll try and get someone who knows more about this sort of thing than
myself to answer your questions.

Best regards,

Joseph

I've started porting QGIS to the GEOS C-API this weekend.

QgsGeometry is almost done - except for
QgsGeometry::splitPolygonGeometry(), where cut edges are queried which
is currently not supported in the C-API.  I'll propose a patch to add
that to the C-API.

The WFS provider also uses the GEOS spatial index, that also has no
C-API.  We also have QgsSpatialIndex, which we could you for that or
propose another extension.   An other solution would be to add that to
the GEOS C-API, too.   Opinions?

BTW I ran across this issue, when packaging QGIS for OSGeo4W (along with
Qt4.4, sip, PyQt4 and GSL).  On Windows the GEOS C++ API is not
supported for as DLL and you're supposed to either switch to the C-API
or link the static library.

Ok I added it to the release checklist too.

One thing I wonder about patching GEOS is that in packaging QGIS for
other platforms we are effectively going to be requiring that a very
recent GEOS is present (i.e. one that includes your patches). Is this
going to be an issue and is there an elegant solution to the issue?

Message-ID: <488DB252.4020409@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
While calling the grid points plugin I get a nasty crash (see below).
The area was taken directly from a grass raster, and the matrix was
1500x1060 points.
QGIS 0.10 from debian.gfoss.it.
All the best.

Hi J?rgen,

For the WFS provider I think it is best to use QgsSpatialIndex. The geos index has been used because QgsSpatialIndex did not exist at this time.

Marco

as I pointed out some time ago (see http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1092), 
the Map Composer is not actually very intuitive;
the bug reported in #1092 is very similar to the Tara's one, and in fact 
it's not a bug (because the Map Composer works fine), but it's due to a not 
intuitive usage of the tool; that's what I suggested replying to #1092:

The only things that we should probably add [to the Map Composer Tool] are:

1. let user resize the objects using the mouse pointer (such as in AutoCAD 
layout composer)

2. show an info label function on-mouse-over the objects, showing out their 
names (such as "Map1", and so on...); it would be very useful if you are 
creating a map layout with multiple map tiles

I don't know what Marco is doing with the new Map Composer; but I think that 
we (he) should take in mind that the usability is the firt real problem for 
the actual Map Composer Tool, and we should first fix that problem before to 
add new features to the new tool to come

Regards,

Marco

Hi Tim.
I see that we still have 53 "mustfix" bugs:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&must_fix=Yes&order=priority
I think we better not release a 1.0 without proper labelling (and of
course we must wait until new printing engine is out).
All the best.

Message-ID: <8721cb1c0807291142v79c6dc07ua6b90beb41a9e39c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am wondering if anyone has developed a plug in that allows one to select
points from a point dataset and move them to a corrected position without
having to create a new point and enter data.

My data is initially entered using a CSV file of tree locations. The GPS
unit is not very accurate and we find we have to adjust the points when
layed upon a orthorectified aerial image.

Best regards,
Sadia

 You should be able to do this with the native editing tools in QGIS. 
Simply select the point layer, click the 'Toggle Editing" button, and 
then use the "Move Feature" tool to move the existing point feature(s).

Hope this helps,

Great thanks for testing out the branch.

I think removing the icons would upset the GRASS users (just my
feeling nothing concrete to back that up), though I would also prefer
to get rid of them. I could make the description box collapse away /
expand back and that seems like a good idea to me too. I generally
prefer it when apps dont have windows that can disappear behind the
main window. Anecdotally one of the most common issues I see novice
users have is dealing with windows that disappear out of sight.

I think the way forward here would be to implement a small grass prefs
dialog where this behavior can be defined. It should be trivial to
have the toolbox as a window or a dockwidget - I'll look into it.

I'll look at experimentally creating an option to swtich between using
tree or list views. I also like your idea of using dots to determine
heirachy, once again not sure if grass users have a different opinion
on this. One argument against could be that the dot prefix e.g. 'r.'
may not be intuitive to novice users where as 'Raster' might mean more
to them. Simply addressed using a 'dot lookup table' though I guess.

Once again somehting that can be made optional window or dock -
informal feedback from others suggests they like it in dock mode.
Other applications I've used e.g. kdevelop, kate etc make use of this
same paradigm (shell in dock) and I've always found it to be a good
experience.

Yes I plan to keep the tools in their own windows but do away with the
tabbed layout (users complain when they have many tools open the tab
bar becomes too long for the window to fit on screen). Other users
have requested the mapbrowser go into a dock (though given the space
confines I dont know if its feasible).

I have pretty much opposite view to you on this - I get irritated with
popup windows and prefer everything embedded in a single workspace. I
also tend to work with each application maximised so your approach of
bits of windows sticking out the back seems to rob real estate from
the main application window, but just in a different way.

Right I agree the best way is probably to try to accommodate the two
different work styles / viewpoints we each represent. I don't believe
it will add much work to do so.

Many thanks for the feedback

Oh, you're right! I was referring to the PostGIS buffer (AKA PostgreSQL
Geoprocessing). *That* I think nobody will miss.
Anyway, I suspect a python frontend to shp2pgsql wouldn't be a difficult
thing to do, and the end result could be more robust than the present
SPIT, who occasionally crashes.
All the best.

 My old eyes didn't notice the Move Feature tool icon changing from
greyed-out to active - I think it needs a splash of colour in the
active version.

Oh, still it does? I haven't been using it much but haven't had a crash

Do not know really, never used recently (shp2pgsql is so nice... but for
most users having a GUI would be surely good).
I was saying that because of the many troubles I found months back
importing layers through SPIT; the same layers were imported smoothly
via shp2pgsl, so I thought a simple plugin acting as a frontend to
shp2pgsl could be more robust. But of course I may be wrong.
All the best.

self.actionmcp.setWhatsThis("None")
QObject.connect(self.actionmcp, SIGNAL("activated()"), lambda
method="mcp": self.showInterface(method))  

# create action for kernel href submenu

self.actionhref.setWhatsThis("None")
QObject.connect(self.actionhref, SIGNAL("activated()"),  lambda
method="href": self.showInterface(method))
[/code]

...and so on.

The code is clearly self-similar. 
I tried to write a cycle to populate the menu, but it doesn't work.

[code]
?mth = {"mcp":"MCP", "href":"Kernel h ref", "lscv":"Kernel h LSCV",
"hadj":"Kernel with adjusted h"}
[declaration of self.action* outside cycle]
for k, v in self.mth.iteritems():
 a = getattr(self,  "action" + k)
 a = QAction(QIcon(""), v , self.iface.getMainWindow())
 a.setWhatsThis("None")
 QObject.connect(a, SIGNAL("activated()"), lambda method=k:
self.showInterface(method))
[/code]

I get no errors when running QGIS from a shell, but no submenu is
displayed.
I've also tried to assign QAction(QIcon(""), v ,
self.iface.getMainWindow()) directly on getattr(), but Python didn't
allow to assign to a function.

Any suggestions?

 This code won't add anything to a submenu, it only defines actions.
Are there some lines missing that call addMenu?

 Here's how spqr does this:

self.menu = QMenu("Statistics")

 then for each menu item, something like this:

self.summary = QAction(QIcon(":/graphics/summary.png"),"Summary",self.iface.getMainWindow())
QObject.connect(self.summary, SIGNAL("triggered()"), self.doSummary)
self.histogram =
QAction(QIcon(":/graphics/histogram.png"),"Histogram",self.iface.getMainWindow())
QObject.connect(self.histogram, SIGNAL("triggered()"), self.doHistogram)
[etc]

 then:

self.menu.addActions([self.summary, self.histogram, (etc)]

 to add my menu to the menu bar I do:

 menuBar = self.iface.getMainWindow().menuBar()
 menuBar.addMenu(self.menu)

 I don't think two lines of repeated code is sufficient to warrant
putting the action item description in a list.

 What could be going wrong with your code is the assignment to a local
variable 'a'. As the variable gets overwritten each time in the loop,
the underlying Qt QAction item might get cleaned up and deleted since
there are now no references to it. I've had code crash on me because
of this in the past. Note that my actions (self.summary,
self.histogram) are stored in the object.

 If you store all your actions in a list that persists in the object
(e.g. self.actions[]) then they'll persist for the life of your
application.

 Also, I'd suggest storing your action information in a python list
rather than a dict so that you can decide on the order. But I think
this approach might get fiddly once you decide to put separators in to
your menu. My spqr code explicitly adds actions and separators to the
menu in the order of the code.

 Hope that helps.

Barry

It is in fact a mistake. But getattr(self,  "action" + k)=
QAction(QIcon(""), v , self.iface.getMainWindow()), that was closer to
the original line, is not allowed.

[...]

Yes, sorry, I missed them in previous mail:
[code]
for m in self.mth:
  self.iface.addPluginMenu("Home range analysis",  getattr(self,
"action" + m))
[/code]

this part works fine. For each method, it adds its item in menu "Home range analysis".

I'll try to use a list-like object. Many thanks for hints!

Hi Barry,

Thanks so much for your patience. Okay so that makes sense...the move vertex
is the move feature...I thought it was the wrong one because vertices are
usually created in polygons and lines and previously when I tried moving the
points with the "move vertex" another point would move rather than the point
i had selected....does this have to do something with the snap tolerance. It
seems quite strange i recall using this type of tool for cleaning up and
when digitizing polygons.

Best regards,
Sadia

I posted the proposal[1] including a patch[2]. The QGIS patch is on [3].

QGIS patch summary:
- cmake now looks for the geos_c instead of the geos library
- QgsGeometry ported to GEOS C-API (needs geos patch [1])
- QgsSpatialIndex now catches (and ignores) exceptions
- removed (previously unused?) references to the GEOS geometry factory from
  QgsOgrProvider
- QgsWfsProvider now uses QgsSpatialIndex instead of GEOS spatial index.

Should this go to a separate branch or do I simply commit it to trunk?  I'd say
it's more likely that it gets the testing it needs in trunk...

I posted a response on this eariler in this thread (28 July) :

One thing I wonder about patching GEOS is that in packaging QGIS for
other platforms we are effectively going to be requiring that a very
recent GEOS is present (i.e. one that includes your patches). Is this
going to be an issue and is there an elegant solution to the issue?


I would prefer to wait until we have a solution to this before
patching your changes into trunk. Otherwise everyone who installs
binaries via apt or whatever is going to complain.

Ways to address it:

- patch upstream geos and wait for change to get into repos (loooong time?)
- figure out a workaround to be able to use unpatched geos
- make geos c-api changes a branch until upstream geos is compatible
- something else?

Hi all,

I re-send that message, because I fear that anyone has noticed it :)

I would like to introduce some changes into the CMake default configuration 
for MinGW, to reflect the "structure" of the QGIS_MSYS_Environment.zip I 
currently provide (see: 
http://www.webalice.it/marco.pasetti/qgis+grass/BuildFromSource.html#Quantum%20GIS).
I always used CMake with its GUI, but I would like to learn how to write the 
config files (CMakeLists, right?) to let qgis be correctly configured with 
the current provided MSYS Environment, thus without the need of further 
CMake "lines hacking".
Where can I find documentation about that?

Regards,

Marco

Easiest is to look under the qgis/cmake dir and look at the examples
we have already created. Please note that I spent quite a bit of time
making a unified way to set dependencies using a $LIB_DIR environment
variable. In theory it should work for your msys environment and you
should need to do nothing more than do:

export LIB_DIR=/usr/local (or wherever you compiled all your dependencies to)
ccmake [options you fancy] ..
make install

For me it will be first prize if you can follow this paradigm of
setting a single LIB_DIR environment var to find all deps, though I
realise that may not work in all cases.

If you really cant see a way forward with that, I suggest adding msys
specific paths for your standard msys deps bundle into each
cmake/Find<foo>.cmake rule - just open a couple of files with a text
editor, the format is quite simple.

Tim

Hi Tim,

I filed a ticket about this [1].  It includes links to the GEOS ticket,
changeset and the qgis patch.

There's already a changeset, so that didn't take that loooong.  But you
are right: I don't know when the next GEOS release is and when the
distributions will pick the new release up.

> - figure out a workaround to be able to use unpatched geos

The GEOS patch only adds a C-API call to get the cut edges from the GEOS
polygonizer.  Which is only used for splitting polygons for
QgsMapToolSplitFeatures (see src/core/qgsgeometry.cpp:4689 [2]).

I must admit, that I'm not really sure if it's just a sanity check,
which we might - at least temporary - disable.  Or disable (again
temporarily) the whole split feature feature.

Hi Anne

Cool stuff I'm checking it out right now! I would suggest (maybe you
already did this) to include a sample dataset in svn so people who
dont have suitable data can still have a little play with it.

I'll give some more feedback when I have tried it out!
