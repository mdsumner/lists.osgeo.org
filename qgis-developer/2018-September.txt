Yes, confirmed. Thanks for clarifying.
All the best.

Hi Even,

I just created an issue: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19746

and assigned you - if this is ok. Feel free to remove yourself if you 
can't work on it.

I also added Richard's related issues for reference.

Thanks a lot in advance!

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] What to do about WFS test failures?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiGYbq1LHtzPDRrC0mcC_6Gv7Q3drshJ8dZE3gVhNLMTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

Just raising the question of what we should do about the constant WFS
test failures we get on Travis. I'd estimate 1 in 3 builds fails
because of WFS related tests hanging.

I'm very reluctant to disable all these tests, because:

1. WFS is super important.
2. I think there may be a real issue here - I've got at least one
customer who is having WFS issues with 3.2 and master. BUT: on the
other hand Travis has always been flaky with any test which uses
threads, regardless of which area of code it's from. So it could just
be Travis playing up again, in which case we'd need to disable these
tests like we do most of the other thread-related tests...

The current situation is basically unworkable. Sooooo.... ideas?

Sorry I do not have any solution,  the only consideration that comes up to
my mind is that if sum up all the time wasted by developers by
unrelated/random Travis failures we would probably be very badly surprised
(as I usually say Travis is basically a very slow binary entropy generator).

Talking about the tests, WFS tests, and (even for different reasons)
http-based integration tests (some auth tests, qgsfiledownloader, many
server OWS tests) are apparently more fragile than others, mainly because
they depend on (sometimes external) http services, but they have proven in
the past to be very effective in spotting out regressions on very important
feature likes WMS, WFS etc., some of them are also important because they
ensure that QGIS client can talk to its server component.

The very bad things about disabling tests are:

- their development costed a lot of time and efforts and disabling them is
not an incentive for the developers to write more tests [1]
- the tests are obviously important to prevent regressions
- before disabling a test we should make 100% sure that we are not
overlooking a real bug (or what are the tests written for in the first
place?)


So, my recommendation - not very useful in the short term I'm afraid -
would be to start exploring other more reliable options for our CI, even if
they are more expensive.

For the time being, as a temporary solution, there are no other options
than disabling though.

Maybe a good idea would be to allocate some money specifically for the
tests (a dedicated grant, a dedicated hackfest?) just an idea...

[1] of course sometimes it would just mean to write "better" and more
robust tests, but I suspect that this is not generally the case.

To add: QGIS recently has some issues and list messages concerning wfs
too. I searched some:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19702

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2018-August/043237.html

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2018-August/043241.html

And myself I also have the feeling that WFS is less stable/usable then
in 2.18 (I release a list of national WFS/WMS/WCS's in one of my plugins).

So I think it is not only CI that has problems, it looks like changes in
WFS made it more tricky to use?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Richard, please let's focus on Travis in this thread.

WFS UX issues on 3.x are a complete different topic.

Ok, sorry. What I just wanted to add: it looks like that 'default'-wfs
behaviour has changed, raising wfs problems .

I just wanted to raise awareness of this, thinking the CI failures could
have the same cause.

Just discovered similar unexpected rounding behavior, but a bit 
different I think:


My expression is this one, to show lengths of tracks on my map, in km:

"etappe" || '\n (' || 
round((length(transform($geometry,'epsg:4326','epsg:31466'))/1000), 1) 
|| ' km)'


The rounding does actually work fine, but it seems the conversion from 
my rounded value to a string is the problem.

Here some examples (qgis 3.3):

round(0.99, 1) --> 1
round(1.00, 1) --> 1
round(1.01, 1) --> 1
round(1.02, 1) --> 1
round(1.03, 1) --> 1
round(1.04, 1) --> 1
round(1.05, 1) --> 1.1000000000000001
round(1.06, 1) --> 1.1000000000000001
round(1.07, 1) --> 1.1000000000000001
round(1.08, 1) --> 1.1000000000000001
round(1.09, 1) --> 1.1000000000000001
round(1.10, 1) --> 1.1000000000000001
round(1.11, 1) --> 1.1000000000000001
round(1.12, 1) --> 1.1000000000000001
round(1.13, 1) --> 1.1000000000000001
round(1.14, 1) --> 1.1000000000000001
round(1.15, 1) --> 1.2
round(1.16, 1) --> 1.2
round(1.17, 1) --> 1.2
round(1.18, 1) --> 1.2
round(1.19, 1) --> 1.2
round(1.20, 1) --> 1.2
round(1.19, 1) --> 1.2


The same works fine in 2.18.16.

Should I file a bug?

Kind regards,
Raymond

Which Qt version is this with? Looks like bugs which we experienced with 5.6...

Can these failures be reproduced locally if one repeatedly tests those
cases?

Yes, 5.5.1

Will it be solved with a newer version? I'm going to test it this week.

Yes - Qt fixed this bug in 5.7.

It caused us endless headaches during the 3.0 development cycle, but
in the end we couldn't solve it and the only fix is upgrading Qt. I'd
suggest you really want at least 5.9 now.

I can't offer any helpful suggestions, but just to let you know I finally had
to disable all my plugin WFS tests. I used to cope, by rerunning failed
Travis runs, but by about three months ago, it seemed no longer usable -
failure after failure.

I was using a third-party WFS, and perhaps I could have got round this by
adding a WFS provider to the test docker image, but in this plugin's case, I
didn't think it worth the significant effort to do so. The WM(T)S tests also
use third-party sources and seem stable, so perhaps this wasn't the
underlying issue anyway.

If an improvement or solution could be found, it would be great to reinstate
these tests.

Thanks

Tom

Hi all,
I very much think that the WFS client is an really bad state, and is not
really reliable, especially in WFS-T context.
The good news is that we just have been funded to refactor it !
The work should start in september and land in 3.6. I will let our dev's
come here with more technical details about the goals. I hope we will also
be able to take benefit of this to this the OGC compliancy of the client
here.
Best regards,
Régis

Nyall,

I have been working on an alternative KML/KMZ importing tool and a tool to
expand HTML tables within the description field containing tag/value
elements into fields in the table.  The reason for another importer is that
the GDAL implementation is in some sense too smart. The situation is that
if there are many folders in a KML, QGIS imports each as a layer and is
very slow at importing or crashes during the import if there happens to be
hundreds of layers. This also happens using ArcGIS. I am assuming that both
use GDAL and in some respects GDAL tries to do too much. Consequently, I
wrote this KML plugin to import KML/KMZ files in the way we wanted them.
The following is the capability prior to processing.

https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/qgis-kmltools-plugin

The biggest difference between the native import and this one is that
rather than create multiple layers for each folder of KMLs, I create one
point layer, one line layer and one polygon layer if required. I add an
additional field that contains the folder structure for each feature.This
makes the import very quick.

I have already converted this importer to processing. The second function
that expands HTML tables in the description field does a first pass to see
if there are any tables and makes note of the tags/fields to be created. It
then pops up a dialog box to allow the user to select what fields they want
expanded. They only way you could do this in processing, since I can't pop
up a selection box, is to expand all potential tags/fields, but the users
don't want to do this. They want to select which fields they want added and
they may not know which tags they want until they look at the list. This is
why I wont be able to do it in processing.

I have debated whether I should make this a separate plugin in or add the
functionality to Lat Lon Tools. I already have conversion routines such as
MGRS conversion and "Plus Codes" in Lat Lon Tools. What are your thoughts?
Should this be added to Lat Lon Tools or a separate plugin?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing Script addLayerToLoadOnCompletion
Message-ID: <536303d5-1404-54dd-fec9-b2cc59b0e005@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was thinking to add a small example of addLayerToLoadOnCompletion
function to the ScriptTemplate of Processing. The code is the following:

    buffered_layer = processing.run("native:buffer", parameters={
        'INPUT': dest_id,
        'DISTANCE': 10000,
        'SEGMENTS': 5,
        'END_CAP_STYLE': 0,
        'JOIN_STYLE': 0,
        'MITER_LIMIT': 2,
        'DISSOLVE': False,
        'OUTPUT': 'memory:'
    }, context=context, feedback=feedback)['OUTPUT']

    feedback.pushDebugInfo(str(dest_id))

    context.addLayerToLoadOnCompletion(buffered_layer.source(),
context.LayerDetails(
        name='new_layer',
        project=context.project()
    ))

but Processing always throws this error:

The following layers were not correctly
generated.<ul><li>Polygon?crs=EPSG:3003&field=ID:long(10)&field=fk:string(254)&field=ROTAZ:long(10)&field=DIMENS:long(10)&field=ETICHETTA:string(254)&field=VALORE:long(10)&field=T_MIN:double(20,5)&field=T_MAX:double(20,5)&field=PIOGGIA:double(20,5)&field=LARGH:double(20,5)&field=LUNG:double(20,5)&field=assex:string(254)&field=assey:string(254)&field=colore:string(38)&field=xlab:double(10,2)&field=ylab:double(10,2)&field=raster:double(23,15)&field=raster_1:double(23,15)&field=raster_2:double(23,15)&uid={685540af-711d-462b-a9d0-9b00af4c2f6a}</li></ul>You
can check the 'Log Messages Panel' in QGIS main window to find more
information about the execution of the algorithm.


Am I missing something?

Thanks for any suggestion

Matteo

Hi Håvard,

I knew that param has been replaced with parameters..

Anyway, removing parameters is not solving the problem

Thanks

Hello,

my question was answered at the QGIS hackfest by Matteo Ghetta with a
DataPlotly code snippet. (-: You can add your own entries into the
"Processing Settings" menu under the "Providers" section by following the
example below in your own Provider class.

from processing.core.ProcessingConfig import Setting, ProcessingConfig

class LAStoolsProvider(QgsProcessingProvider):

    def __init__(self):
        QgsProcessingProvider.__init__(self)

    def load(self):
        ProcessingConfig.settingIcons[self.name()] = self.icon()
        ProcessingConfig.addSetting(Setting(self.name(),
'LASTOOLS_ACTIVATED', 'Activate', True))
        ProcessingConfig.addSetting(Setting(self.name(), 'LASTOOLS_FOLDER',
'LAStools folder', "C:\LAStools", valuetype=Setting.FOLDER))
        ProcessingConfig.addSetting(Setting(self.name(), 'WINE_FOLDER',
'Wine folder', "", valuetype=Setting.FOLDER))
        ProcessingConfig.readSettings()
        self.refreshAlgorithms()
        return True

    def unload(self):
        ProcessingConfig.removeSetting('LASTOOLS_ACTIVATED')
        ProcessingConfig.removeSetting('LASTOOLS_FOLDER')
        ProcessingConfig.removeSetting('WINE_FOLDER')
        pass

    def isActive(self):
        return ProcessingConfig.getSetting('LASTOOLS_ACTIVATED')

    def setActive(self, active):
        ProcessingConfig.setSettingValue('LASTOOLS_ACTIVATED', active)


    def loadAlgorithms(self):
       [...]

and you can always query those settings with code snippets such as

from processing.core.ProcessingConfig import ProcessingConfig
from processing.tools.system import isWindows

    @staticmethod
    def hasWine():
        wine_folder = ProcessingConfig.getSetting("WINE_FOLDER")
        return (wine_folder is not None) and (wine_folder != "")

    @staticmethod
    def LAStoolsPath():
        lastools_folder = ProcessingConfig.getSetting("LASTOOLS_FOLDER")
        if isWindows():
            wine_folder = ""
        else:
            wine_folder = ProcessingConfig.getSetting("WINE_FOLDER")
        if (wine_folder is None) or (wine_folder == ""):
            folder = lastools_folder
        else:
            folder = wine_folder + "/wine " + lastools_folder
        return folder

Regards,

Martin

Message-ID: <CABSWR-E11G7PZm+nfeZbKs=SxZarwK3q2+h9cQva0dqfcwvvaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

as soon as I run any of my LAStools plugin scripts I get the WARNING
"ResourceWarning" about an "unclosed file" shown below in the Python
warning window. I use the call "output = subprocess.Popen(....)" to get the
stderr output from the process so I can push it to the console once the
subprocess is complete with
the feedback.pushConsoleInfo(output.decode("utf-8")). Is it bad? Can I fix
it? Should I ignore it?

Régis,

Not that I'm against improvements, all the contrary, but just wanted to 
underline that the provider was seriously refactored already in 2.16. Clearly 
the lack of WFS-T support for 1.1 and 2.0 in the scope of those enhancements 
can be a source of confusion currently for users. What do you have in mind as 
refactoring exactly ?

Hi Even, thanks for pointing that, I missed that history.
I'll ask the dev's for the detailed improvements planned, I dont' have any

Can I also add that the refactoring that was funded in 2.16 added tests,
paging support, filter query builder and dynamic caching. There is now a
lot of complexity in the driver due to the complexity of WFS server
implementations and the standard, plus the multi-threading code. If a
refactor is proposed I would be against anything that doesn't deal current
use cases and edge cases which have already been implemented. Maybe some
analysis of the failed tests is the first place to start. WFS-T is a side
issue to that.

Cheers,
Jeremy

What about starting with/focusing on WFS 3? The new version is really
cleaner and seems much more efficient.
The current WFS implementation in QGIS is much better than previous
versions, even if sometimes making a virtual OGR file il the only way to
use some services. There are really bad server implementations out there,
additionally an automated solution struggles against misleading and lazy
XML informations. This is a broken idea or at least one that asks for close
cooperation between server and client.
Just my remaining cent.

I agree WFS 3.0 is a much better implementation and it would be great if a
implementation is started soon to track the current standards development.
However, we still have (and will have for a long time) a user need to
support WFS 1.0 and 2.0 - so this still needs to be deal with.

I think you need a:

output.wait()

after this line. See

The reason for another importer is that the GDAL implementation is in some sense too smart. The situation is that if there are many folders in a KML, QGIS imports each as a layer and is very slow at importing or crashes during the import if there happens to be hundreds of layers. This also happens using ArcGIS. I am assuming that both use GDAL and in some respects GDAL tries to do too much. Consequently, I wrote this KML plugin to import KML/KMZ files in the way we wanted them. The following is the capability prior to processing.

Sounds handy -- I've hit this in the past too. Those HTML tables
inside KML really annoy me a lot.

> I have already converted this importer to processing. The second function that expands HTML tables in the description field does a first pass to see if there are any tables and makes note of the tags/fields to be created. It then pops up a dialog box to allow the user to select what fields they want expanded. They only way you could do this in processing, since I can't pop up a selection box, is to expand all potential tags/fields, but the users don't want to do this.

Ok, so in this case I'd suggest:
- Make sure your code is nicely partitioned, separating out the core
functionality from the gui component
- Add a "callback" type argument within your converter, which is used
to select which fields to import
- Make your plugin add both a processing algorithm AND the
non-processing, interactive action
- The processing algorithm sets a callback which returns ALL fields
always, with no user interaction. The Interactive action passes a
callback which shows the field selection dialog.

This gives approach gains you:
- A single unified code base, with clear gui/logic separation (so also
easy to write unit tests for)
- Makes the users who want an interactive choice happy
- Still exposes your functionality from within Processing for users
who want everything, or want to use this function within a model OR
from another plugin/Python script.

That's the "canonical" approach to take here.

Nyall

> I have debated whether I should make this a separate plugin in or add the functionality to Lat Lon Tools. I already have conversion routines such as MGRS conversion and "Plus Codes" in Lat Lon Tools. What are your thoughts? Should this be added to Lat Lon Tools or a separate plugin?

Separate plugin -- they are very different functionalities, and
plugins work best when they expose "atomic" functions.

I'm with Even here... please, proceed with extreme caution.

We may be seeing issues with the WFS provider since 3.2, but I do not
think a full rewrite is needed/wanted here, and potentially will cause
many regressions given how finicky WFS servers are and how many
server-specific fixes have been required in the current
implementation.

I'd suggest based on Tom's post that the work should include some sort 
of reliable way of testing the WFS client (and of course full test 
coverage) - I don't know if GeoServer is Docker-happy these days, but 
the default install in a VM should be sufficient for the task (it comes 
with test layers) - although GeoServer doesn't support WFS-T for writing.

Cheers,
Jonathan

"GeoServer doesn't support WFS-T for writing" ... what??? :-)

The default data directory disables writes for any user but the
administrator, you can change it, or just authenticate
as the admin to run WFS-T

Hi,
I just checked the goals of the work on the WFS provider. It is not a
refactor in fat, sorry for having used that word. The work consists in
having a closer look to the WFS and snapping cache interactions because
they cause lots of problems when the distant database has triggers that
would require WFS cache reloading and then snapping cache reloading.
Maybe Vincent can tell more about that, but it's not a major change then. I
should'nt have raised the hand here, sorry for the noise.
Regards,
Régis

are you reloading processing plugin? the temporary path of processing are
statically set once (c++ static var in QgsProcessingUtils) for qgis session
=> if you reload the processing plugin without exitig processing (e.g. to
update the list of scripts), the oldtemp folder is no more available but
still referenced => generating strange errors at the end of any process.
Just rerun qgis to check if this is the problem.

There is no easy fix other that avoid static variable end method (e.g.
refactoring) of QgsProcessignUtils, bts is not a common use case errors,
but only happens to script developers => no fix is necessary.

Hi Ginetto,

well actually this is a simple script and not Processing plugin, so I
think no reloading is needed

Message-ID: <CA+T_MsKAdto_KbLBPJr5ZSYFnmwk0Q+sOaeQkU6MGk5yZ2yf1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

As a (happy) Linux user, I switched to Mac (High Sierra 10.13.6) for some
QGIS development and I see that
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL still suggests qt4 and
python 2.6 for Mac. Does anyone has a suggestion what to use/read to
facilitate the building of current master and get quickly up-to-speed?

Also, can you please point me to the scripts/repositories that are used for
official Mac releases?

I have found https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac, but I am not sure
if that can be used for development?

Thanks a lot for any ideas!
Peter

Hi Peter,

You can look at current Homebrew formula:
https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/blob/master/Formula/qgis3.rb

You'll find a very good doc from Larry (althugh might be a bit outdated)
https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/tree/master/development

Otherwise, there is blog post from David on how to build using Mac ports
https://www.3liz.com/blog/rldhont/index.php?post/2017/06/01/How-to-build-qgis-on-OSX-with-MacPort

If while using one or the other, you feel like updating the readme, do not
hesitate to do so ;)

Cheers,
Denis

Hi Peter,

Warning, if you are using macport: qt5.11 is installed by default and you may (or may not)  experience some display problems, instead you may choose to stick to qt5.9 by installing

the 'qt59' port

Is that the infamous "small canvas" issue?

Hello.

thanks for the suggestion. I tried this instead:

        output = subprocess.Popen(commandline, shell=True,
stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=open(os.devnull), stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
universal_newlines=False)
        output.wait()
        feedback.pushConsoleInfo(output.communicate()[0].decode("utf-8"))

but as soon as the subprocess is started (long before it completes) this
WARNING is output to the console.

2018-09-04T13:05:31     WARNING
warning:C:/Users/isenburg/AppData/Roaming/QGIS/QGIS3\profiles\default/python/plugins\LAStools\LAStoolsUtils.py:60:

how do others grab the stderr output off their subprocesses for display in
the console?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Some initial OpenCL feedback
Message-ID: <04b10f9a32a8a865f8ed9c3b8b00e7d3@carto.net>

Hi Alessandro, 

I just tested if the hardware acceleration (OpenCL) helps in the live
hillshade renderer. 

The good news is that it works stable so far and substantially improves
rendering time of the live hillshade renderer. My notebook on my
workplace is rather slow. Without hardware acceleration it renders the
hillshade in approx 8 seconds (large window on two screens). With OpenCL
acceleration set to on, it renders in about 1 second or even less. I
assume quite some time is also spent on reading the file. This with
resampling on (average for zooming out and bilinear for zooming in
beyond native resolution). 

Hardware is an Intel HD Graphics 4600. The CPU is also listed as
supported. 

Visually, with or without HW accelation on, there still are some
rectangular artefacts in both versions. 

Tested on Windows. 

-------------- 

One more thing: on my machine there is no restart of QGIS necessary for
the changes (HW acceleration on of off) to be applied. This is contrary
to the statement in the settings dialogue, which says, that a restart of
QGIS is necessary. 

--------------- 

Thanks a lot for your work! 

Andreas

Hi, 

Thanks for all info. That qt bug looks scary :O

Qgis 3.4 for other platforms (linux, windows) will be released with which version of Qt ? 

Cheers
Peter

Hi Andreas,

thanks a lot for your feedback, I honestly am a little worried about the
possible problems on different platforms, graphic cards and driver
versions, I choose to stay on the safe side and there is a safeguard that
disables the OpenCL support at the first issue in the renderer.

The processing algs looks generally more stable (never got a single crash
myself).


The good news is that it works stable so far and substantially improves

Yes some time is spent on reading the file and some time is spend on I/O
tranferring data to/from the graphic card, this means that the performance
gain is usually higher on larger images than on smaller images.

Hardware is an Intel HD Graphics 4600. The CPU is also listed as supported.

Yes: that does not change, the algorithm is pretty much the same in both
implementations.

The text can probably be improved: what needs a restart is if you change
the device, enabling and disabling OpenCL support does not require a
restart.

Hi Alessandro, 

Thanks for the clarification that only the change of the OpenCL-device
needs a restart. 

I tried both - acceleration in CPU and in GPU. I had the impression that
the acceleration in the CPU was slightly faster than in the CPU - but
not a lot faster. Maybe the GPU (Intel HD Graphics 4600) is not too
powerful. It is a ThinkPad notebook, not a desktop. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Thanks for the info!

Yes, maybe that the lower I/O (there is no need to transfer data to/from
the graphic card) compensates the slower processing on the CPU

Yeah, I haven't updated the build instructions for QGIS 3.  It took me a while to get going on figuring out all the new stuff (I've had a lot of distraction the past year or so).

I don't have any published scripts for the official build.  Mostly it's just following the build instructions (what they would be when I update them), plus a bundling script for the extras bundled in the app (not necessary for anyone installing from source).

Thanks for the reminder that the instructions need updating.

Last I heard, homebrew wasn't quite ready with a 3.x build.

I don't know about that, I use Qt 5.9 in my official build, and it has the small canvas problem.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Feature freeze / exemptions
Message-ID: <13560adb-e36c-da81-2420-aebc4c23d9c7@opengis.ch>

Feature freeze is coming end of next week with a freeze window of 6
weeks. In the past, we have regularly granted freeze exemptions to some
features upon request.

I think it would be good to know, what we can expect this time to decide
on what is granted and then send them over to Loomio for review.

Myself, I would like to include Geometry Validation
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/131). I
estimate will require about 1 to maximum 2 more week to get it into a
mergeable state, which will still leave us with 4-5 weeks of bugfixing
time for this code. One part of it is, it will revisit some of the
geometry checker code which is corrected for threading and other issues,
so that can already be seen as "bugfixing of existing code" that will
land as part of it.

Thanks a lot and best regards

thanks for this request - this is indeed a gray area that has caused
some discomfort in the past, so it will be good to have more clear
guidelines. I think it will be difficult to carve them in stone however;
some ad hoc evaluation will be necessary.
Maybe we can ask three questions:
* should we set a hard limit for freeze (e.g. no exemption in the last X
weeks), or we can decide anytime based on the merit of the code submitted?
* whom should decide on this? I personally think core developers should
have a much heavier weight in this decision than PSC
* based on which (more or less objective) criteria? This could include
isolation of code,  i.e. likelihood that it will break other parts,
importance of the new feature for the majority of users, quality of the
code, commitment to promptly fix bugs.
All the best.

I would also like to pre-emptively apply for a freeze exemption for
the work detailed in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/114 and
currently the target of the crowd funding campaign at
https://north-road.com/edit-features-in-place-using-qgis-spatial-operations-campaign/

The fund raising is proceeding nicely and I believe this work will be
successfully funded, and I'd love to get it in for 3.4. I'd estimate
1-2 weeks post freeze for merge.

In that case, would it be possible to postpone the feature freeze by 2
weeks and set it as a hard(ish) deadline?

I think the approach to let voting members decide as we did last time
(https://www.loomio.org/d/38Aiya0q/3-0-soft-freeze-exemptions) works fine.

 * This committee includes several technical members
 * Everyone is free to vote or not, based on self-evaluation of knowledge
 * Particular questions concerning the mentioned gray area can be
formulated on a case-by-case basis

For those following at home -- I think the underlying issue (a bug)

it makes sense to me - perhaps this should be particularly stressed in
the voting question, otherwise people will feel obliged to vote (which
often means +1) even when they cannot grasp the implication.
All the best.

Yes, we can state that explicitly.

In the past, e.g. here
https://www.loomio.org/p/BPc3Wj6l/duplicate-feature-redigitized we had
33% participation. Not sure what the reason for abstaining was, one
assumption would be that many did not feel comfortable enough to make a
decision. Or pure lazyness or disinterest ;P

Message-ID: <CAMtsY+bP0fJOJHWXBVOPj9aNgsCMo6TW+34MeJ4Yc7fzVR87BA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

There is a persistent issue of slowness of QGIS on Mac.
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19546

The last comments led to think that this comes from high resolution.
Starting from 2560x1440, it starts to be less and less usable. And
completly unsuable at 5120x2880.

I'd like to know if someone is using such resolution on another OS to be
sure that this is Mac specific (and if I need a 5K screen ;) ).

Thanks a lot,

Denis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Handle Bad Layers
Message-ID: <06dcddb9-edd0-7272-d09a-f8cebbb1ec2e@mindspring.com>

Hi Devs,

I have a question about the "Handle Bad Layers" dialog. My scenario is 
working offline and loading a project with WMS layers defined. As the 
WMS is unreachable, the layers are marked as "bad". Since the layers are 
not fixable while offline, they get deleted from the project.

I would like to continue to edit the layers locally stored on my laptop 
and not lose the definitions of the WMS layers when saving the project.

I would like to see the "bad" layers marked as "disabled because bad" 
and not deleted from the project. This would keep the stored information 
about the layer in the project. When the project is next opened while 
connected to the internet these layers would be available without having 
to enter them again.

Is there currently a way to do this?  Or should I add an enhancement 
request issue for this idea?

I think this is a widely desired feature, and something I'd very much
like to see available "out of the box".

For 2.x there is a plugin "changeDataSource" which allows this
behavior. I don't think that plugin is available for 3.x yet.

3840x2160 here, on Linux/Win, and perfectly usable. That's the highest
res I've got available to test with.

Message-ID: <CAExk7p3m5C6uYur8455L=19ntBOPC5mk_ABgDrg2TiZf157_NQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

(I took the liberty to CC in some of you that I thought may be interested
by this)

I'm dreaming of using the QGIS graphical modeler to output PDFs using print
composers. This would allow to build very interesting report generators
using our favorite tool. As far as I understand, currently, it is not
possible.

I'd be interested in working to implement it, to start with as a plugin
(prototype), and once this works see if we can integrate into core.

What I thought of so far is to be able to specify as inputs :
- a QGIS project [file] (using the current project if empty - esp. useful
in conjunction with the great new embedded models feature)
- a composer name [string] (use the first one if empty)
- N layers [layer] (I don't think we can support variable inputs count, so
could be 5)
- N layer ids [string] (id of the layer in the project to be replaced by
corresponding input)

The algorithm would replace the datasources from the file, and then export
the pdf somehow (yet to be determined how, but there seem some good
resources <https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/289228> around this).

I'm not sure it's the best way... I especially don't really like the use of
layer ids (as they are not easy to find). Maybe layer name would be better
(even if there may be duplicates, but the user has control on the QGIS
project so that may be acceptable).

Has anyone done any work that goes in that direction ?

Do you have some ideas about implementation ?

Cheers,

Olivier

Me too: I've been using a 4k 3840x2160 screen on Linux for 3 years now
without any slowness problem.
MacBook Pro 15'' retina with Ubuntu Xenial also works very well.

Hi devs,

About the changeDataSource plugin, there is a testing working version (it can be downloaded and installed from zip) for Qgis 3.x on https://github.com/enricofer/changeDataSource/tree/qgis3-migration-test still not on oficial repository.

Regards,

Jorge Almerio

I think this is a widely desired feature, and something I'd very much
like to see available "out of the box".

For 2.x there is a plugin "changeDataSource" which allows this
behavior. I don't think that plugin is available for 3.x yet.

Bad layer handling is not currently supported under QGIS3. for now.

Just to second this statement: any contribution that works towards this
goal (especially for QGIS core) gets my full support! (for a long time
already ;)

Alessandro, on Mac, how did you installed/compiled QGIS? Homebrew, MacPorts
or KyngChaos ?

Hi Denis,

Sorry if I wasn't clear: I wiped out the hard disk completely, put a QGIS
sticker on the Apple logo and I'm happily running Ubuntu on my MacBook Pro
15'' :)

Hi all,
maybe from a voter point of view, this is uncomfortable to vote for last
minute exemptions, as this does not have such sense from a democratic
perspective.
Voting is essential on strategic issues, but voting on "do you want this
now, or within 4 months" may not appear so important - except if you funded
the feature yourself.

As a user, I'd really want the two mentioned features for the next LTR,
I've wanted them for so long. But in the other hand, I think we should
really not end into a systematic feature freeze exemption process.

I know QGIS is a do-ocraty, and we owe so much to our top contributors that
we can't refuse them anything, hum... professionally speaking I mean:-)

However having work still going on while in feature freeze does not help in
dedicating fully to bugfixing and testing.

Last point, some teams have been rescheduling hard and sometimes canceling
deserved vacations to respect feature freeze deadline. Just to be clear,
this doesn't concern Oslandia this time, but this happened in the past.
Seen from this perspective, I'd like we don't repeat this at every release.
Customer usually can wait for 4 months more.

Regards,
Régis

Hi Regis,
so in short your proposal is no exemption?
All the best.

Well, my point is that in exceptional cases, that could be of course
discussed, but not at every release.

Hi All,

I have created QGIS Feature request #19790, "Handle Bad Layers - DISABLE 
instead of DELETE" about this problem.  Change it to a BUG if it should 
be classified that way.

I've summarized my ideas there. Please add your suggestions so this can 
be solved in the best way possible.

Thanks,

*Worth Lutz*

Count me in too -- I'm very interested here, given my history with
both Print Layout and Processing work!

I've got (Python) code which allows Print Layout parameter choices
(exposed as a combo box showing layouts within the current project),
and a layout "map item" parameter (links to the print layout
parameter, and shows a nice combo box of map items in the selected
layout). I can clean this up and share, but honestly my preference
would be to get this in to master as c++ code.

I think ideally the "print layout" parameter would expose both layouts
in the current project + a "..." file selector allowing choice of a
Print Layout template file (.qpt) (this should be relatively
straightforward -- basically a new temporary layout would be created
using the selected qpt). Possibly we could/should have an option in
that drop down to allow selection of a layout from a different project
file too, but this would add considerable complexity, and I'm unsure
if there's a concrete use case for this which couldn't be handled by
qpt template files alone.

> - N layers [layer] (I don't think we can support variable inputs count, so could be 5)

There's already multi layer parameters available for algorithms (which
also support layer order), so these could be reused here.

> Do you have some ideas about implementation ?

I'd see a number of ways we could expose print layouts/atlas to
Processing. Some potential algorithms could be:

Exporting algorithms
---------------------------
- Export layout. Just does a direct export of the selected layout to a
specified file. Nice and easy! [1]
- Export atlas. As above, but for a pre-existing atlas and selected
folder/file destination.
- Something like "export layout as atlas", where users select and
existing layout/qpt, map item, and "coverage layer", and the algorithm
iterates over the features in that layer just like an atlas, but using
a map layer generated elsewhere in the model as the coverage layer.

Utility algorithms
----------------------
- Create layer from layout map item extent. Creates a new polygon
layer with a polygon feature of the are currently visible within a
selected layout map item. Handy for quickly creating a polygon layer
with the exact coverage of a map item for styling or atlas creation
purposes. (I've implemented this one already as a PyQGIS alg)
- Create atlas feature template: After selecting a layout map item and
specifying a desired "scale" and "origin point", the algorithm creates
a new polygon layer with a single feature of the required size which
makes the map item match the given scale [2]. The use case here is to
create the feature, then "copy and move" it multiple times over the
area of interest for an atlas.
- Some equivalent of the ESRI "Create strip map index"  tool/QGIS
PolyStrip plugin. Select a map item, desired scale, and line feature
layer and the algorithm creates rotated template features along the
lines to allow an atlas following the line. Options for overlap
margins, max map rotation, etc.

Layout creation algorithms
-----------------------------------

We could also have algorithms for assisting with editing/creating
layouts themselves, e.g. algorithms which created grids of guides,
grided layouts, etc. I'd LOVE LOVE LOVE a layout "spell check" tool!

Anyway, count me in here. I'm interested in helping in whatever way
desired - I can either mentor someone else to code this, or would be
interested in doing it directly if there's a sponsor available.
Alternatively we could write up all the desired specs and run a crowd
funding campaign to raise funds!

Nyall

[1] Would work super-well with a potential "QGIS variable" parameter,
which displays as the QGIS variable editor and which would allow
tweaking of expression variables to inflence the map render
[2] I'd also like to see a proper parameter widget for "scale"
parameters, which uses the nice QGIS scale widget instead of just
direct number entry.

Hi Régis,

I see the point, thanks for raising this. The source of the freeze
exemption is that last-minute pull requests were merged without much
review just to get it in. In the end, this often resulted in worse code
quality because no in-depth review had been done and only issues that
surfaced and were connected to a given PR would actually be fixed. This
mostly affects the small number of developers who do the job of
reviewing pull requests, just before the release they have the double
burden of finalizing their own pull requests and reviewing other pull
requests which tend to land also just a couple of days/hours before
freeze. The exemption on request for a selection of PRs with good
reasoning is an approach to tackle this dilemma, which so far (to my
knowledge) was not under a broader discussion which I interpreted as
silent agreement.

Alternatives to this approach exist, so if this is deemed a problem and
different approaches are on the table, I would propose to raise a motion
after the release of 3.4 so we can review and discuss them with enough
time for everyone to raise their voice. Does that work for you?

Best regards
Matthias

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New KML Tools Plugin
Message-ID: <CABPxTTrVpqmRKnpjz3VJwomkPgGpat2ZWs6s_2f5Ry2pWoL8zg@mail.gmail.com>

I just released a new KML Tools plugin that includes a fast KML importing
tool and one to expand the KML description field, containing HTML tables
with name/value pairs into fields in the output layer.

Why have another KML import tool? We have had issues with importing KMLs
into QGIS. The situation is that if there are many folders in a KML, QGIS
imports each as a layer and is very slow at importing or crashes during the
import and it can generate hundreds of layers. This also happens using
ArcGIS. I am assuming they both use GDAL and in some respects GDAL tries to
do too much.

With the KML Tools importer rather than create multiple layers for each
folder in the KML, I create one point layer, one line layer and one polygon
layer as needed. I add an additional field that contains the folder
structure for each feature. This way you can still filter on the KML
folders.

The second tool is to expand an HTML table in a layer's field (presumably
from a KML although it could be any layer) into separate attribute fields.
For example if a layer has a description field containing the following, it
would create two new attribute fields named 'City' and 'State' and will
populate the contents appropriately.

<table>
     <tr><td>City</td><td>Provo</td></tr>
     <tr><td>State</td><td>Utah</td></tr>
</table>

This is a first release and I realize that it will not handle all cases,
but it works for our needs. The KML importer is not a complete KML
implementation so I am looking for your input as to what you would like to
see. As I get additional examples I can make the import better and the
'description' expansion better.

Because KMLs are so unstructured, it is impossible to handle all cases of
expansion and even within the same KML different formats may be used in the
description field that may contradict each other. The only ones that can
really be handled are the most structured cases.

Here is the new plugin:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/kmltools/

Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi

Is there a setting anywhere to disable the warning when closing a project with temporary layers (This layer contains one or more temporary scratch layers.  These layers are not saved to disk ....)

Thanks

Chris,

There is:

QgsSettings().value( QStringLiteral( "askToSaveMemoryLayers" ), true,
QgsSettings::App )

Switch that to false, that'll disable the warning.

I was wondering how long it'd take for the memory layer saver plugin to
switch that off ;)

That is, have your plugin set that setting to false upon loading. I wasn't
suggesting to switch the overall default to false.

Thanks Nyall for you very interesting ideas.

Initially, I thought of using layouts from QGIS projects rather than
templates, as it makes it quite simple. You just create a normal QGIS
project, setup styles, layout, enable or not atlas. The processing alg
would just allows you to swap the datasource of one (or several) layers. It
would make it very straightforward when using processing models embedded in
the project file, and still relatively simple when using an external QGIS
project.

But looking at it again, it seems like it would be possible to achieve
exactly the same thing with .qpt with "lock layers" and "lock styles" is
ticked, as styles, layers and atlas settings are all saved in the .qpt.

Remains the questions of the UI on how one would match input layers to
existing layers in the qpt...

About the utility algorithms, am I right understanding there are not
directly linked to the PDF exporting algorithm (but just general helpers) ?

The way forward I see is me trying to do a prototype as a python plugin (of
course if you can help by reviewing, that would be awesome), and once
stabilized, we can see how to move this to core (I personally am more at
ease with python, but could probably try to move it to C++ if we think it's
worth it and if you can mentor a little bit). That also allows to move
forward without being too stressed by release dates / feature freezes (as
there would be the python plugin).

So it would be nice if you could share the python code you were talking
about.

Cheers,

Olivier

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] On precision in qgsRound() (3.3.0 master)
Message-ID: <1536573879528-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

qgsround is defined in qgis.h (since 3.0) as

 inline double qgsRound( double number, double places )
   {
    int scaleFactor = std::pow( 10, places );
    return static_cast<double>( static_cast<qlonglong>( number * scaleFactor
+ 0.5 ) ) / scaleFactor;
   }

and it seems only used by QgsUnitTypes:: scaledDistance and scaledArea which
are used in turn by QgsUnitTypes/QgsDistanceArea formatDistance/formatArea
and then by the homonymous ones of QgsMeasureDialog and QgsMapToolIdentify.

It seems to me that there is a flaw in qgsRound which leads to inconsistent
results of the Measure Tool in QGIS 3. (See the difference underlined in red
in the screenshot at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7836#issuecomment-419718554 between
segment length and total length values respectively rounded by
QLocale().toString() and by formatDistance through qgsRound()).

In fact, 'scaleFactor' is declared as Int and thus it can store up to the
9th power of 10, consequently the rounding provides incorrect results from
the 9th decimal place onwards.

Since it is allowed to set up to 12 as the number of decimal places in
Setting->Options->Map Tools (and moreover in Project Properties->General
there is no upper limit to the decimal places allowed to be set!), I think
'scaleFactor' should be qlonglong in order to correctly store at least the
12th power of 10 (while 'places' could be Int or less; and the
static_cast<qlonglong> could be <qulonglong>, provided that qgsRound() is
only used to round measurements, as it seems to be now).

In QGIS 2.18 this problem is not present, since both formatDistance and
formatArea rely on QString().arg(), which works similarly to
QLocale().toString(), to round measurements, instead of on qgsRound() (which
is also defined differently in 2.18 API).

I don't know if there could be a better approach to round numbers or how to
fix this flaw in a better way avoiding any overflow.

Hope this can help to improve QGIS 3.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Should we disable Processing modeler for the next
	3.4?
Message-ID: <CAFO80_poa8yAZqromNQao0j30f401YjjSNOtv=1-mbG9bH8g7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I'm having really unreliable experience with processing modeler and grass
commands in master. Other have the same experience?

some problems has been already reported:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19700

IMHO there are two big problems
1) lack of test for algs in modeler... kind of integration tests whilst
other part of processing are well covered.
2) There are not so many users moving models to 3.x => many use cases are
not covered yet.

probably mine is a narrow vision based in my little experience with
modeler, and I would be happy to discover that the problem is mostly mine.

opinions?

Luigi Pirelli

p.s. my experience is mostly with compiled qgis on linux env

Hell no! (no wait, that's not strong enough...! #$%#$% no!!!) ;)

> I'm having really unreliable experience with processing modeler and grass commands in master. Other have the same experience?

I don't have any direct experience with models using grass, so would
be keen to hear other's feedback here. My experience is generally with
using native and Python provider algorithms alone, in which case
modeler works well.*

* (Using modeler in QGIS has always been a balancing act of
frustration... I find that I'm always getting 95% of my model
implemented, before hitting some missing feature in modeler which
would allow me to do that final 5%. Maybe over time this has increased
from 80% to 95%, but we're still not at 100% yet! When all parameter
widgets are ported to the new modeler widget api this will get my
models to maybe 96%, with another 3% bump when full expression
contexts are available to modeler parameters in the "precalculated
expression" mode. But that's all feature requests anyway, not
bugs/regressions!).

> some problems has been already reported: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19700

I do expect some short-term fallout from
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7761, but we should easily be able
to get this in shape for 3.4 final. And the benefit of #7761 is that
each parameter which is ported is gaining 100% unit test coverage,
something widget wrappers have never had in the past. Parameters
ported so far are string, boolean and CRS parameters (the rest will
need to wait for 3.6).

> IMHO there are two big problems
> 1) lack of test for algs in modeler... kind of integration tests whilst other part of processing are well covered.

That's a good point, but conceptually there shouldn't be any
difference to an algorithm running in modeler vs outside of it. I
think the issue with grass is more to do with "running more than one
GRASS algorithm in a single qgis session".

> 2) There are not so many users moving models to 3.x => many use cases are not covered yet.

Yes, many use cases are definitely not covered yet. But I don't think
these are regressions, just missing features/functionality  (let me
know if they are regressions).

Yes, that looks correct! Can you open a PR with a test case fixing this?

Hi,
It's been a day or two since upgrading the latest packages for Debian testing (buster) and I couldn't add new WMS/WMTS layers (or use any already added in the project).The bug is reported here #907774 - [libqt5network5] Requires openssl >= 1.1.1 - Debian Bug report logs  and the error message in QGIS when trying to add a new layer is: 
"Download of capabilities failed: Error while setting the maximum protocol version". As it's written in the report, the temporary workaround is to install libqt5network5_5.11.1+dfsg-6_amd64.deb over the latest libqt5network5_5.11.1+dfsg-7_amd64.deb .
I know there's some of you that are also using it, just letting you know.

All the best,
Tudor

that's could be a problem... but probably not in my use case.

I tried to avoid completely to use 2.18 version also to face all possible
issue and trying to fix them, so I can't say if it's a regression.

I cannot download the list of plugins from qgis - could it be the same
issue?

thanks Tudor

Apparently it is different:

Error while setting the maximum protocol version

Anyone has the same issue?

Thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Update an intermediate table with selected
 features (many-to-many relationship)
Message-ID: <845f7d2d-f550-559b-c840-e440581c6cd8@tigeo.fr>

Hello,

I'm a QGIS user and I need information about a QGIS functionnality which 
doesn't exist yet to my knowledge. Here's my problem :

I have a PostgreSQL database with two tables :

- The first one contains geometry data defining hiking sections
- The second one contains a list of trails
One section can be linked to several trails, and a trail can be linked 
to several sections : it's a many-to-many relationship.

I then create an intermediate table to link trails with sections and use 
a QGIS project I've created to update it. I've set appropriate 
relationships in project's features. From there, when I click on a 
section with the "Identify Features" tool or in the attribute table's 
section, I can easily indicate which trail(s) is(are) linked.

However, I need to do this section by section : I can't select several 
sections at once and indicate in a few clicks which trail(s) are linked 
to the sections I've selected. Is it possible to do that with QGIS ? I 
couldn't find anything about it.

If such a feature isn't available, do you know if its under development 
or if there's a way to help to create this tool? Please let me know.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards,

Alice Martin

Hi Alice

Many-to-many functionality is available in QGIS, see here:

https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/233944/9839

usability-wise it's sometimes still a bit tricky though.

Matthias

The underlaying issue is the removal of TLS < 1.2 support by default in
openssl 1.1.1, see: Debian Bug #875423 [0].

TLS 1.0 and/or 1.1 support needs to be enabled explicitly using
SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version() or SSL_set_min_proto_version() as
mentioned in Message #70 [1].

There is a separate issue for Qt5 which has a workaround in the mean
time. [2]

I have had problems QGIS 2.x.x versions with Processing time ago. Now
I hope to have time to test 3.4 these days.

Speaking about GRASS: It's a long time wish from me that there would
be a QGIS delivery (via Installers) where GRASS and SAGA are optional.
I've had so many experiences in teaching QGIS and I've seen so many
use cases where I wished to have a more slim QGIS without Java and
without such big sized libraries. Having said this, pls. let me add
that I'm using GRASS myself sometimes for certain analyses, and that I
appreciate GRASS and SAGA very much.

I'm chiming in with this wish because I think that this could be
related to separating adding and separating unit tests.

I'm not sure if this simple fix could completely solve the problem in the
right way, avoiding any overflow.

Taking better account of any side effects:

now in QGIS 3.3.0 master, as said,
'scaleFactor' defined as Int overflows when 'places' > 9, leading to
incorrect rounding,
while static_cast<qlonglong>((number * scaleFactor) + 0.5) and the whole
'result' already overflow when 'number', the measure to round, is at least
about:

places = 8     -> 92'233'720'369 units
places = 9     ->  9'223'372'037 units (see overflow in action [1])
places >= 10 ->  4'294'967'296 units (see [2])


instead, with the "fix" [3],
'scaleFactor' defined as qlonglong doesn't overflow at all for 'places' <=
12 (actually <=19)
but then static_cast<qulonglong>((number * scaleFactor) + 0.5) overflows
when 'number' is at least about:

places = 8     -> 184'467'440'738 units (better then now)
places = 9     ->   18'446'744'074 units (better)
places = 10   ->     1'844'674'408 units (worse)
places = 11   ->       184'467'441 units (worse)
places = 12   ->         18'446'745 units (worse)


I can not fully understand the reasons [4,5] that led to rewrite qgsRound(),
introduce scaledDistance/scaledArea and modify formatDistance/formatArea,
anywayI think now it could be better to:

- completely avoid to use qgsRound() in scaledDistance/scaledArea and rely
only on QStringLiteral().arg() in formatDistance/formatArea to correctly
round the measurements value [6]
or
- reduce to 9 (or less) the maximum precision value allowed to be set in
Setting->Options->Map Tools and in Project Properties->General [7]
or
- introduce some kind of logic in qgsRound() to handle and prevent overflows
or
- (?)

Some tests are needed, but I can not do them all by myself for now.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Can I automatically style a layer generated with a
	Processing Sink?
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqzD6C8vPTeC+3GNyL0O-5C_T6=aZSGZeMzjcPgjbqmPw@mail.gmail.com>

In a processing routine I create an output vector layer.

        self.addParameter(
            QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSink(
                self.PrmOutputLayer,
                tr('Output layer'))
            )

        (sink, dest_id) = self.parameterAsSink(parameters,
            self.PrmOutputLayer, context, fields, QgsWkbTypes.LineString,
srcCRS)

I would like to style the output layer by enabling a label based off of one
of the fields. Can I do this in Processing? I guess what I would like to
get is the actual vector layer that is created. Is that possible?

Thanks,

Calvin

Mmm, Debian testing user here... :-)

Anything I can do to make (self compiled) QGIS work again? It is now
more or less unusable to me as webservices and plugins are unavailable :(
Can I do anything to fix it in my local version? Do I need to enable
SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version() or SSL_set_min_proto_version() somewhere?

We do not have power to fix apache on public services, but can I enable
ssl protocol versions on plugins.qgis.org to make that work again?

Any other option?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

In python you may check the `processing.core.Processing.RenderingStyles` that enable you to associate a style (as a qml file) to a pair (alg, output). It is also possible to 
do that from the Qgis GUI  ( but I do not remember the details ).

AFAIK this is in done in libqt5network5 and the OpenSSL API is not
exposed through Qt to allow users to select the protocol version.

> We do not have power to fix apache on public services, but can I enable

It's a client side issue, all code that uses the OpenSSL API needs to
account for the TLS 1.3 changes in OpenSSL 1.1.1, which is unlikely to
migrate to testing any time soon due to the massive breakage it cause in
unstable.

If I understand the issue correctly, TLS_MAX_VERSION was changed to TLS
1.3 in OpenSSL 1.1.1, but TLS 1.3 is not available in OpenSSL 1.1.0
which is still in testing.

Applications using the OpenSSL API also need to enable the older TLS
versions (< 1.3) explicitly using the *_set_min_proto_version()
functions or they will use TLS 1.3 by default when built with OpenSSL 1.1.1.

> Any other option?

Wait for libqt5network5 (5.11.1+dfsg-8) to migrate to testing [0]. It
contains a change to not require openssl 1.1.1 in testing to fix #907774
[1].

Mmm, ok. Thanks Bas for this info!

I hope and wait then; glad I have also a 2.18 build here, which still
seems to work... and some VM's in case I really need 3.x :-)

Hi Calvin,

I think the way to proceed is to use the processing set style for vector
layer algorithm within the script.

You can have a look also at this thread:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2018-May/053513.html

Hope this helps

Actually the best approach is to use a layer post processor. This is
flexible and totally thread-safe :)

I don't think there's any Python examples in QGIS yet, but see

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/analysis/processing/qgsalgorithmcategorizeusingstyle.cpp#L104

and

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/analysis/processing/qgsalgorithmimportphotos.cpp#L227

for some c++ examples.

Here's a possible Python example:

Hi Tudor,

well, because I'm afraid to mess up my system... I do not find myself a
hardcore Debian admin. But maybe I'll try it.

Ok, I tried...

$ wget
http://http.kali.org/pool/main/q/qtbase-opensource-src/libqt5network5_5.11.1+dfsg-6_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i libqt5network5_5.11.1+dfsg-6_amd64.deb

works \o/

Thanks Tudor for the push :-)

There's the possibility to set styles to the output of a saved model by
right-clicking on it (I think it's the GUI David was mentionning).

I'm not sure but this as well as Matteo's methods rely on external .qml
files, which is not ideal for models portability. It would be a great
addition to be able to embed the styles (actually, other files as well) in
the processing models themselves.

Cheers,

Olivier

Nyall,

Thank you so much for your help. That was exactly what I needed and I don't
think I would have figured that one out.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Discussing default snapping and node editing
	settings
Message-ID: <23695504f4b35d8c443a20501c522c98@carto.net>

Hi, 

I noticed that by default QGIS is set to edit ALL layers and also snaps
to ALL layer by default. I do think that this is a bad default setting,
esp. with larger projects. 

We had issues because users had WFS layers in their project (read only,
as reference) and QGIS tries to index these WFS layers and to get their
vertices in order to snap to them. Then QGIS hangs and freezes and there
are network time outs. Apparently one has to kill QGIS using the task
manager. 

I think the better default is to edit and snap only in the active layer
by default. 

Opinions? 

Andreas

Hi,
+1 !
However, I see lots of customers switching to the "Snap all layer"
settings, "because it is simpler". And then they face very slow snapping
index creation issues.
In the QWAT project, we have been thinking of exposing the indexing
strategies in the UI of the advanced snapping.

see here:
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsSnappingUtils.html#a2ea7577667b94657e14f63ba7dd0bf07
----------------------------
IndexAlwaysFull

For all layers build index of full extent. Uses more memory, but queries
are faster.
IndexNeverFull

For all layers only create temporary indexes of small extent. Low memory
usage, slower queries.
IndexHybrid

For "big" layers using IndexNeverFull, for the rest IndexAlwaysFull.
Compromise between speed and memory usage.
IndexExtent

For all layer build index of extent given in map settings.
--------------



And for WFS and any other cached provider, we may probably add some
exceptions to the global strategy to avoid fetching the remote datasource
by default. Using the local cache is better. However, when doing WFS
editing, this start to look like a can of worms.

Hi all,

Another idea would be to add a new mode 'All layers but the remote ones'.

Anyway, I agree that default mode should be 'current layer'.
Actually, we just miss a new option in main settings to define the default
mode (there is already the default type).

Hi,

Editing the active layer is appropriate, but you may need to snap to 
another layer even if it is for reference.
The best would be for the user to be able to tell which layers to use as 
a snap.

Hi Aurelio,

That's what the advanced digitizing mode is made for, you can define per
layer settings.

If the most frequent case is snapping to the same or to one or two other
layers, is not a good idea to ask the user to resort to advanced settings.
The proposed idea to put the choice of  layers in the basic snapping
options seems a reasonable solution IMHO.
About WFS - but this is true for remote geodatabases with slow connections
- indexing should happen on the current canvas with a clear limit on zoom
level: snapping to at little scale is dangerous, you will never understand
if you snapped to the right now or to something that is hidden behind a
simplification artefact.
A possible solution is viewing an enlarged area about three or four times
the confidence circle and indexing inside it in real time.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Export PDFs from the processing modeler

Hi,

I've setup together a quick prototype :
https://github.com/olivierdalang/processingpdf

It's a plugin that adds an "Export as PDF" algorithm.

You can have a look at the readme which provides a little bit more info.

There's a sample project including a processing model that uses the Export
to PDF algorithm to showcase what's possible (requires QGIS 3.3 + PR #7864)


So far, I sticked to my first intuition which was to use a project as the
starting point (rather than just a layout). The algorithm just allows to
"override" the datasource from layers in that project. The rationale is
that the project may contain relatively complex logic (atlas configuration,
table joins, etc...), and that this way, everything would (hopefully)
continue to work if it worked in the initial project.

If taking a layout as a starting point, we'd almost have to recreate
projects in the processing model, which would quickly be limiting or
over-complex. With "lock layers" and "lock styles", we could at least use
some predefined layers, but then it's much less practical to work with and
still isn't as flexible as using a whole project.


There's a few bugs in QGIS master that are a bit annoying (esp.
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19836 that prevents the sample model to work
in batch mode), I'll try to see if I can figure out what's happening but
C++ isn't my cup of tea...

But besides this, no major technical limitation I think ! I've written down
a few ideas for next steps in the readme (short&longer term).

Let me know what you think !

Olivier

Hi,
CCing to qgis-dev as nobody in community seems... inspired by the question
and I'd like to close that old PR and rebase other changes.

Thanks for any hint.

Hi,

thank you for your suggestions and pointing me the to right places in
documentations.  After some struggle and frustration, I managed to setup my
MacOS environment to be able to do some productive work on QGIS. I ended up
with homebrew approach and especially
qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/development/README.md was helpful. The QGIS build
with qt 5.11.1 looks usable too.

Unfortunately I had some issues with tap qgis/homebrew-qgisdev. It is not
possible to even tap it from master and qgis3 formulae is not working. The
QGIS3 formulae in OSGeo4mac homebrew repository is updated and working. I
am wondering if qgis/homebrew-qgisdev is actively maintained and used?
Also, what is the benefit to maintain this formula over osgeo4mac/qgis3
formulae (they are very similar)?

Prepared https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/pull/72 with changes I
made to be able to build QGIS3 (I used the scripts, development/README.md
and followed the QT Creator path in the document). We should update
qgis/QGIS/INSTALL for OSX (that was the first doc I checked). I am happy to
help with docs and homebrew-qgisdev, but first I need to clarify the status
of qgis/homebrew-qgisdev.

Thanks,
Peter

Hi,

How complicated would it be to implement (or sponsor) a Ribbon-like UI to
QGIS?
(i.e. MS-office 2007+)
Do you think people would like that kind of UI for QGIS?

Regards,
Idan.

Hi Idan

Sourcepole already did a very nice ribbon implementation for QGIS for their fork of QGIS for the Swiss military. It was on GitHub somewhere

https://github.com/sourcepole?utf8=✓&q=qgis&type=&language= <https://github.com/sourcepole?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=qgis&type=&language=>

But I can’t see where in their repos it is any more. There are no active plans to port this work to the official QGIS builds though.


Regards

Tim

Hi Peter,

At this point homebrew-qgisdev tap is not maintained anymore.
The effort is concentrated on osgeo4mac tap, you can use --HEAD to install
current master
see
https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/blob/master/Formula/qgis3.rb#L42

I think the most valuable things in the qgis one are the READMEs.
We should move them to the QGIS repo and we could remove homebrew-qgisdev.

I might maybe spend a bit of time cleaning this during the bugfixing.

Denis

sounds good, +1 for moving READMEs to qgis/QGIS and removal/deprecation of
homebrew-qgisdev.

I do not have that much experience yet with development on the platform to
write full docs, but I can help with review/test of the new docs once
ported.

In the meantime, could someone with merge rights in homebrew-qgisdev just
add big note at the beginning that this is not maintained anymore and
osgeo4mac should be used instead?
thanks
P.

Hi,

Thanks you all!

Marco,
I see that kadas-albireo <https://github.com/sourcepole/kadas-albireo> it
is based on QGIS 2.8.
Are there any plans to rebase to QGIS 3 or to send changes upstream to the
official QGIS build ?

Kind regards,
Idan.

Tim,

Can you grant one of with admin rights (not only commit rights) on
homebrew-qgisdev ?

Cheers,

Unfortunately I don't think that's even possible now -- the
differences between the two codebases is just too extreme, given the
HUGE amount of changes made for QGIS 3.0. I suspect the effort of
re-writing the changes made in the fork would be less than the effort
required to port them now.

Just iterate directly over the features from the source. The things
which processing.features used to do is taken care of transparently
for you now.

I.e.

    source = self.parameterAsSource(parameters, 'INPUT', context)
    for f in source.getFeatures():
       # do something with f

As much as possible, Processing-specific methods were removed in QGIS
3.0 in favour of the standard PyQGIS calls. This was done to reduce
code duplication, and make the API more consistent (i.e. easier to
move code between Processing algorithms -> standalone scripts/plugins
and vice versa).

Nyall,
Thank you for the input!
Do you think it would be relatively easy to rebase on the latest 2.18 from
2.8?

No, I don't think that would be an easy task at all! Even between 2.8
-> 2.18 there's been thousands, maybe 100's thousands of lines of code
changed.

You'd probably have more luck cherry-picking individual commits
between the kadas branch and QGIS 2.18.

Message-ID: <AA22C0C3-7FF2-4813-BB54-960A30B5DE22@phased.co.uk>

I want to build a very basic desktop map application using the QGIS API. 

My development environment is currently Mac OSX High Sierra and Qt5. 

I’m struggling to find any developer documentation to get me started and the GitHub repo suggests OSX builds of QGIS need Qt4.

Can my objective be achieved? If so can anyone point me to some docs to get me started

Hi,

Qgis 3 use Qt5  and Python 3.5+ , if you use Qgis 2 api then you have to use Qt4.

You have the Qgis API  documentation here: https://qgis.org/api/

How do you install qgis ? homebrew, macport, custom build or from https://www.qgis.org/fr/site/forusers/download.html ? the exact version of Qt Qgis depends on may vary with the distribution.

Message-ID: <CABPxTTr8Y0wp2av7-MPvX_PjKFSTr1Uhcy+u-0sOGkcgXsHH8Q@mail.gmail.com>

If I try to rotate an EPSG:4326 vector object, I get the nice outline while
rotating, but when I click to complete it, the shape is badly misshapen


If am guessing it is because of being in 4326, but the problem is what you
see while rotating is not what you get as the final result. If I do the
same with something like a UTM projection then it works correctly.

What is the intended operation of the tool? It shouldn't show one thing
while rotating and then deliver a different result. I am guessing that the
move tool may also be distorting shapes, but I have not really looked at it.

Do I need to write a geodesic move and rotate tool as part of the Shape
Tools plugin?

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi,

Thanks Nyall. If it uses the same getFeatures method (already shown
multiple times) then I'll remove that example.

Message-ID: <f7d31e18-1a12-514d-d513-8422bae7388f@faunalia.it>

Hi all,

yesterday I completed a PostGIS course, and I realized that the PostGIS
raster support in QGIS 3.2 has become much worse, to the point of being
essentially unusable. I can provide samples to check. I think the
current situation should be corrected; if we cannot realistically
support them, perhaps better (I hate saying this) drop the support at
least for 3.4.

Is anybody interested in checking?

All the best.

Hi all,

on Debian Sid the qgis2web plugin refuses to install because it cannot
import name QtWebKit.

In fact, apparently only python-pyqt5.qtwebkit is available, not pyqt4
(although libqtwebkit4 is available).

Anyone knows a workaround or a proper solution?

Thanks.

Yes, see:

 https://bugs.debian.org/828031

 https://bugs.debian.org/882663

Qt4 is EOL upstream, and its WebKit module is a security nightmare
because of that. Hence the removal from python-qt4.

> Anyone knows a workaround or a proper solution?

The proper solution is to port the plugin to QtWebEngine with Qt5.
That's what Qt upstream recommends over QtWebKit.

The workaround is to use the 2.x packages from qgis.org which still
build and install the QtWebKit libraries that were removed from
python-qt4 in Debian.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Install our packages.  The security nightmare should be libqtwebkit4, not the
bindings - but only the latter removed.  Our packages contain them.

Apprently an issue with the UTF-8 characters in the new expression help files -
I also see that in the nightlies of master on Linux - but not on local builds.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Using embedded widgets in the layer tree on a
	python plugin
Message-ID: <CAFcNcQYZbxoxayoR=dmnmBugrFikgodu_paZJJ0Sp6PNdqBehg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all (specially Martin Dobias)

I'm working on a plugin that will use embedded widgets in the layer tree. I
am using the following as reference:

-  Martin's PR that brought this feature into existence (thanks for that
BTW):
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3170/files#diff-3b9be845f2ea37602ca451f18acceab4

-  This QGIS dev thread where Martin provides some more detail on how to
refresh the legend:
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QgsLayerTreeViewMenuProvider-and-default-values-tt5296424.html#a5296695

-  This stackexchange thread where the transparency slider is discussed:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/232367/showing-transparency-slider-by-default-in-layers-panel-of-qgis

-  The master branch of QGIS' repo

I'm starting out by just showing a simple QLabel in the layer's legend,
just as a proof of concept. I want my plugin to work with OGC services
layers (WMS, WFS, etc), meaning it shall only try to add widgets to layers
that are of these types.

I have roughly the following python code:

```
logger = partial(qgis.utils.QgsMessageLog.logMessage, tag=__name__)

class MyWidgetProvider(
        qgis.gui.QgsLayerTreeEmbeddedWidgetProvider):

    SUPPORTED_DATA_PROVIDERS = [
        "wms",
    ]

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        logger("Instantiating provider...")
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.creation_timestamp = int(time.time())

    def id(self):
        logger("id called")
        return "{}_{}".format(self.__class__.__name__,
self.creation_timestamp)

    def name(self):
        logger("name called")
        return "My Widgetss"

    def createWidget(self, map_layer, widget_index):
        logger("createWidget called")
        widget = widgets.QLabel("hi world!")
        widget.setAutoFillBackground(True)
        return widget

    def supportsLayer(self, map_layer):
        logger("supportsLayer called")
        provider = map_layer.dataProvider()
        name = provider.name()
        result = True if name in self.SUPPORTED_DATA_PROVIDERS else False
        logger("supportsLayer: {}".format(result),
level=qgis.core.Qgis.Debug)
        return result
```


This code kind of works, but I'm facing two problems at the moment:

1. The `MyWidgetProvider.supportsLayer()` method is never called. The
logging call does not show up on the console and I also see that my
provider is offered on WMS layers, but also on some local vector layers
(which is not what I intend). grep'ping around the QGIS' source code I
could not find some place where this method would be called and used, so
I'm wondering if this is implemented. I would expect this method to be
called when the layer properties dialog is opened, so that my provider
would get filtered out for layers that were of the wrong type;

2. This code does not update the legend for the layer, UNLESS it is a
vector layer. If I try to add this provider to a WMS layer, the legend is
not updated. If I add it to a shapefile, it works as expected. In order to
get my QLabel to show up on WMS layers, I have to manually run this in the
QGIS python shell:

```
view = iface.layerTreeView()
view.model().refreshLayerLegend(view.currentNode())
```

However, I am not seeing where in my plugin's code can I add this snippet.
I only want the layer tree to be updated AFTER my provider creates the
widget, but this moment seems to be out of my control. Also, I am puzzled
by the fact that vector layers work just fine while my raster (WMS) does
not.


Thanks in advance for your help :)


Best regards

Thanks. Where can I find the package?

cat /etc/apt/sources.list | grep qgis
#qgis
deb    https://qgis.org/debian-ltr buster main

aptitude search qtwebkit | grep 4
i A libqtwebkit4 - libreria per motore di contenuti web per Qt
p  libqtwebkit4-dbg - libreria per motore di contenuti web per Qt -
simboli di debug

Cheers.

Thanks. The problem stemmed out from the fact that I am using 3.2 from
package, and 2.18 from self compiled.
All the best.

Now I get a previously unseen error:

CMake Error at python/CMakeLists.txt:345 (INSTALL):
  INSTALL FILES given no DESTINATION!

but I do not find the corresponding option in cmake.
Thanks.

Hello all


Sebastiaan Couwenberg wrote

The QtWebkit issue has caused problems with qgis2web many times:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+qtwebkit+

I've never done any work toward removing QtWebkit from qgis2web, for three
main reasons:

- as a Windows user, I don't fully understand the underlying issues (eg is
it QtWebkit itself or its Python bindings?)

- my belief was that QGIS itself depended on QtWebkit (possibly for HTML
support in labels or some such)

- QtWebEngine has lagged behind QtWebkit in functionality (I don't know if
that is still the case)

I guess my questions arising are:

- is the problem only with Qt4, and hence QGIS 2? If so, with 3.4 becoming
LTR next spring, my strong inclination is not to bother attempting to
migrate to WebEngine

- does QGIS core still use Webkit?

- are there any other reasons that migrating from Webkit is required under
Qt5?

Thanks for any pointers

Tom

Qt upstream stopped developing QtWebKit and switched its focus to 
QtWebEngine, the former will most likely be removed from Qt5 at some 
point, see:

  http://blog.qt.io/blog/2013/09/12/introducing-the-qt-webengine/

For the affected versions of Debian (and Ubuntu) the QGIS package includes the
bindings for the still existing library.

So it's not an issue for plugins if our packages are used.

Hi all,

as you know, next LTR (3.4) is coming soon. Its documentation is lagging
behind, so the PSC decided to invest in updating it. Those of you who
are interested in writing it please reply to this message stating;

* which part of documentation you are interested in updating

* if you can take the responsibility for completing it, or if it's just
for a part of it

* for how many hours (approx) you are available.

This will allow us to correctly budget this task. We welcome anyone, and
will give priority to those who already wrote substantial parts of the
current docs.

All the best, and thanks.

Correct. Layout HTML items, HTML annotations and Resource Widget with
integrated viewer all depend on QtWebkit, and will not be ported to
QtWebEngine for the foreseeable future. (It's just not possible --
QtWebEngine is missing required functionality.)

Very much so. QtWebEngine seems targeted at the simple use case of an
integrated web page viewer, vs QtWebkit which has a much more powerful
API. Specifically, the big blocker is that QtWebkit allows rendering
of webpages AS VECTORS onto a QPainter. Last I checked (maybe ~6
months ago) discussion at Qt channels was that this was
non-trivial/impossible to implement in QtWebEngine and was not being
actively worked on.

sure, I'm working on it, with the help of other users. Not easy because
of different versions of many libs. Main objective of this mail was to
check if it's a local issue, and there are tons of happy PGRaster users
around. My impression is that they are not widely used.
All the best.

Thanks for all the info and clarification, both. OK, so it's not worth
looking at QWE yet. Seems like a suboptimal situation, to say the least.

Hi all,
My nightly packages updates just fell broken today because of a missing
dependency for qml-module-qtcharts .
I suppose this is related to https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7801
It seems it is not packaged in Ubuntu 16.04. Does that mean that QGIS won't
support anymore ubuntu xenial for 3.4 ?

The next build will not have that dependency (see cab5fe02d).  I suppose that
only affects bar and pie charts in forms.

Hi list,

I'm working on my plugin (IOGeopaparazzi) in order to make it available 
also for QGIS 3.

I have troubles converting this function 
"iface.legendInterface().isLayerVisible(layer)" that checks the layer 
visibility in a loop of all loaded layers in the map.

What I want to do is to make a list of only visible layers loaded in the 
map.

legendInterface was completely deleted from the QGSI 3 API. How can I 
reproduce the same function in QGIS 3? Any suggestions?

Thanks,

enrico

Hi Enrico

You can use the Layer Tree API. Something like:

project.layerTreeRoot().findLayer(layer.id()).isVisible()

Thanks Tom!

for those who need, this is a working snippet for processing alghorithm:

         layermap = iface.mapCanvas().layers()
         layers = []
         # add only visible layers
         layTreeRoot = QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot()
         for layer in layermap:
             if layTreeRoot.findLayer(layer.id()).isVisible():
                 layers.append(layer)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New Features in Shape Tools 3.2.0
Message-ID: <CABPxTTrsS7HyvxB4+xPDG6=x5DowW2BJXb6kNaFnn-E99KStWQ@mail.gmail.com>

The latest version of Shape Tools has several nice new features.

1) *Geodesic Measurement Layer *will take a line or polygon layer and for
each of the geometries calculate the geodesic distances of each feature.
The user can choose whether each line segment is measured and output as a
line measurement or whether the entire line/polygon geometry is measured.
It outputs a new layer of styled lines that display the measured distances.
Here is an example of the results processing a polygon layer.

 measure-polygon.jpg
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lr1HsPPRs_sSR6Hz93f06xfsv0T2Z5Dk/view?usp=drive_web>

2) *Azimuth Distance Sequence Digitizer* - This provides the ability to
click on the map as a starting point and then give a series of bearings and
distances in the order of 'bearing 1, distance 1, bearing 2, distance 2,
... bearing N, distance N' and it will create a path.

3) All shape creation has been ported to the processing toolbox.

4) Additional ellipsoids are now supported.

*So what is next?*

Here are some possible next steps.

1. *Interactive drawing *of the shapes that are not already a part of the
QGIS interface. If a polygon or line layer is selected and editable then
the user would select a shape, parameters, and then click on the map and
draw, rotate, and size the shape.

2. *Geodesic Move and Rotate tools*. It appears that the QGIS vector move
and rotate tools work using the layer's projection so if it happens to be
in degrees you get some strange results especially when rotating. There is
a need for true rotate and move tools that preserves the area and size of
the object.

If you have any suggestions I would welcome them.

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi,

I've been reported some missing translations we have in the French
interface of QGIS: there are some strings that are translated in Transifex
(for weeks, months now) that do not appear in localized QGIS.
See for example the attached screenshots where some strings are still in
English though no untranslated occurrences is available on Transifex, as
shown with the "Print Layout..." example.

Are these issues only french ones? And could that be fixed to improve our
translators experience and expect a full translation of the next LTR,
please?

Thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Unable to get QGIS interface in another laguage
 than the system's - broken feature?
Message-ID: <CAECJsSq4rM56xMMQeBpfX+2v29NK5WAQA4-Vq=wzWUrPpspA0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I don't know if it's a local issue nor how I can get it sorted but I'm
unable to change the language in which QGIS interface is displayed. I can
get access to the Options --> General but whatever language I choose,
reopening QGIS results in the same French interface. Creating new profile,
changing the language and reopening QGIS changes nothing. All my profiles
use the same language. The menu "User Interface Translation" still shows
the language I select in the combobox but that language is applied nowhere.

Regards,
Harrissou

See https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19879

I didn't have time yet to look into it but I've been able to reproduce on
Windows, it looks more like a CMake/installation issue, maybe Juergen would
be the best candidate for a quick fix.

Um, I started, but rolled back my work once I noticed that you already assigned
it to you - and just linked #19853 with which's fix I probably introduced the
problem.

The problem was that the translation was initialized too late and now it's
probably an issue with the two QgsSettings (settings & mySettings) in main.cpp
("Should be cleaned up in future to make this cleaner." - I agree ;))…

Thanks Jürgen! I'm more than happy to leave it to you :)

I thought it might be related with my recent changes with QLocale, that's
why I started looking at that bug but I run out of time yesterday and I was
just able to confirm it on windows.

If it was "Print Layout..." there wouldn't be a problem - but it's "Print
Layout…" and that's apparently an issue on Windows (at least with Qt 5.9).
On Linux it works and I hope that it will solve itself with a Qt update.

Oh yes, that's it. Thanks Jürgen. Browsing the dialogs/menus, I agree that
the use of ellipsis instead of 3 dots is the problem: whenever the original
label is with ellipsis, the translation is not used. And given how spread
those characters are used in the application, I'm afraid this is a big
issue for Windows non-English users (would be a pity for a LTR release).

I see similar problems problems in Italian version of QGIS 2.18.x.
There are some strings that appear in english but they are not present in
original .qm file.
these strings are not translated in other languages, for example in Spanish.

Some of these strings are (thx Totò Fiandaca for the picture):

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/t378656/traduzione.png

I think that Transifex should be contain all version of QGIS that are still
supported and not only the Master version.
For example, during this period of coexistence between the QGIS 2.18.x LTR
version and the 3.x versions, the two transifex projects should remain
active for the master and for the 2.18 that is still released with updates.

ciao

Currently we only have master in transifex.  For the release branches it's
handled like it's used to (ie. scripts/update_ts.sh and linguist).

Hi,

it is the same for the Hungarian translation.
In QGIS 3.2.x some menu options are shown in English, but those are 
translated from the very beginnig (version 0.9).

Regards,
Zoltan

As far as I remember, when I've built the .qm file in Linux and installed 
manually in Windows, it worked fine. So looks like a build issue. 

It doesn't help to solve the issue, but at least it's a workaround for power 
users / support providers...

I didn't try that.  Good catch.  The qm from the linux nightly works fine with
the windows nightly.  So it's apparently just something about lrelease on
Windows…

Message-ID: <1537365967626-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

I've never managed to get tests of Processing GDAL algorithms to run under
Travis for qgis2web. It returns:

Processing(2): Error: Algorithm gdal:warpreproject not found

(eg https://travis-ci.org/tomchadwin/qgis2web/jobs/430529787#L874)

Someone (possibly Nyall?) must have realized this was an issue some time
ago, and added the following to some tests:

@unittest.skipIf(int(gdal.VersionInfo('VERSION_NUM')) >=
GDAL_COMPUTE_VERSION(2, 0, 0), 'Test requires updating for GDAL 2.0')

These ones are indeed skipped (eg
https://travis-ci.org/tomchadwin/qgis2web/jobs/430529787#L1021)

Can I get this working? I'm only testing against release and dev (not LTR).

Thanks

Tom

I can't help you too much. But maybe have a look to what has been done by
Nyall in InaSAFE:
https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe/blob/develop/safe/gis/processing_tools.py#L21
There is one GDAL algorithm, running on travis.

Ouch.  Actually it was neither a windows nor a Qt issue - just the old Qt4
lrelease was used…

	parameter?
Message-ID: <CA+qEb=0JW4bAejr=+zP9GyL8Z3VQ_CcaO+Nyn5Ov_Tm-M84MOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
is it expected behaviour for QGIS Server 2.18 to ignore MAP parameter in
URL when QGIS_PROJECT_FILE environment variable is set?

I have QGIS_PROJECT_FILE set, so my endpoint "/wms" serves default project,
but I'd like to access another project from the same endpoint - I'm trying
here with just specifying MAP parameter, but changing it's value does not
affect response in any way. In fact, I can do "&MAP=asdfasdf" and still get
default project, while changing other parameters works normally.

I though Environment Variable works as default option that you can
override, but it seems it doesn't?

Best regards
Adam Borczyk

Yes, because I want to publish only one project, we don't want that a user
can build a request to access to an other project...

I think this could be written more explicitly in the documentation that it
is the purpose of setting environment variable and that it cannot be
overriden. Anyway, thanks for your help, thing is clear now.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Edit widget browse button crashes QGIS (hub:#19118)
Message-ID: <1537453468526-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

Has anyone been able to make any progress with
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19118? It seems severe to me, but perhaps the
fact that ?only Windows users have reproduced the issue means it hasn't had
much attention? If I can help with debugging or testing, let me know.

I'm specifically interested, as that edit widget is what allows images in
info popups in qgis2web exports, so I've been unable to investigate and
solve issues such as https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/issues/661.

Thanks

Tom

Shape Tools is fantastic, and plugs a much needed gap in QGIS core
functionality. Lovely work!

Can I strongly encourage you to investigate porting some of these
features/fixes over to QGIS core? You've obviously got the talent and
knowledge to do so, and it'd be great to offer this functionality
out-of-the-box. I'm available for mentoring if you need assistance
with QGIS core development/build setup/general c++ help!

Hi all,

I have been noticing some delays on mail sending from our bug tracker.
It seems to be a bit random, I have been receiving mail about 1 or 3 hours
later, but I just received one 23h after the modification [0] (I have
received others in between).

Is it getting tired ? ;)

Great work!

I've uploaded my layout widgets & utility algorithms. Might be worth
pulling these in too:

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Best way to run external command line tools
 because of overwritten system path
Message-ID: <CAExk7p2GA9hf-y_nYsvdvMhxzbveayUnhRZ-pZtnH2QNqaJgzg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

In a python plugin, I need to call an external command line tool (docker)
through subprocess.

However, it seems this is not as easy as it seem, as at least on Windows,
the system path is reset on startup. I think this happens in o4w_env.bat :

REM start with clean path
set path=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin;%WINDIR%\system32;%WINDIR%;%WINDIR%
\system32\WBem


I understand the idea behind this, as it probably avoids some complicated
issues of conflicting tools. But it also makes it hard to use external
tools.

What is the recommend way to do it ?

I found that old thread :
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/107204/system-variable-path-overwritten-in-qgis
where there's a suggestion to retrieve the path from the registry. But that
looks a bit fragile (and windows only).

Another one could be to add a setting in the plugin to specify the path of
the executable, but this is relatively technical (you need to explain to
the user where to find the executable, which will be hard especially if
it's not in a standard place).

Would it be an option to keep a copy of the original path env var, that
could be used when needed in the code ?

Thanks !!

Olivier

Yes, we missed the window.  The "nightly" was ongoing when the build was still
busy with a version predating the fix.  And in the next iteration the "final"
sip problem was interoduced, which broke builds on xenial and stretch (ie. with
sip <4.19).

That's fixed now too and this iteration should now work again - actually 
i386 for xenial-ubuntugis is "already" finished and it's currently building
amd64.

No, there was someone else on qgis-user with the same problem (but I responded
to soon there - as I hadn't noticed the "final" issue yet).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Has QgsLayout.itemById() changed?
Message-ID: <8766b38d-47fb-5be1-a670-623aab3c6e25@terglobo.nl>

Running this python script (in qgis 3.3):

p = QgsProject.instance()
lom = p.layoutManager()
lo = lom.layoutByName('a4')
item = lo.itemById('label_title')
print(item)


a few weeks ago, it outputed this:
<qgis._core.QgsLayoutItemLabel object at 0x7fe90b6d0318>


but today it outputs:
<qgis._core.QgsLayoutItem object at 0x7fe90b6d0318>



My next line is:

item.setText('hello')

which doesn't work anymore, because there is no setText() function on a 
QgsLayoutItem. Has anything changed recently? Does any one know a solution?

Regards,
Raymond

Hi Raymond,

confirmed, there is probably something broken in the bindings, please file
a ticket.

Hi Raymond,

You know what? I've just rebased and rebuilt current master and I cannot
reproduce it anymore :(
I checked the bindings code and it looks fine, can you check latest master?

I wonder why there are so few plugins installed with the 2.18.24 version of QGIS. Where is Congedo's SCP?

Hi,

Plugins are to be installed by yourself via the Plugin Manager.

You should see the 'SCP' plugin there and install it.
There is also an online list of plugins:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/

where you can search there too? Installing should be doen vai QGIS though.

Searching for scp I find:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/scpplugin/

IF it does not show up in your list in QGIS, then apparently QGIS cannot
load the plugins.xml? Maybe you are behind a proxy (which you can give
in the network properties?)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Just to clarify, Arne meant that one:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/SemiAutomaticClassificationPlugin/

As Richard said, if your QGIS can access the network, you should see ~800 
available plugins in the Plugins -> Manage and Install Plugins menu.

There is a few preinstalled plugins only, as in general plugins are meant to 
be user (or admin) installed.

Borys

I just downloaded QGis 3.2.3-Bonn, andthere  SCP plugin was included. Now I struggle with the "Clip multiple raster" function. I can't get hold of the input files by clicking on the [cid:image003.jpg at 01D45287.47B00E90]  though both raster and shape files are added. Earlier versions showed the selected raster, and the shape file name appeared at once when marking in “Use vector for….”. Is there a bug or am I doing something wrong. So far I haven’t found an answer in the SCP manual.

For 2.18 lack of plugins, please make sure you have the "show experimental
plugins" option enabled in the plugin manager settings.

Hi Arne,

Please use the SCP issue tracker to report your problem:

https://github.com/semiautomaticgit/SemiAutomaticClassificationPlugin/issues

Please report your QGIS version (QGis 3.2.3-Bonn, as you said) and SCP
version (go to SCP → ABout, SCP version, like 6.2.3).

Add a description of the steps you take before trying "Clip multiple
rasters".

Regards,

Jorge

I just downloaded QGis 3.2.3-Bonn, andthere  SCP plugin was included. Now I struggle with the "Clip multiple raster" function. I can't get hold of the input files by clicking on the [cid:image003.jpg at 01D452BB.9A7CF730]  though both raster and shape files are added. Earlier versions showed the selected raster, and the shape file name appeared at once when marking in “Use vector for….”. Is there a bug or am I doing something wrong. So far I haven’t found an answer in the SCP manual.

Just to clarify, Arne meant that one:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/SemiAutomaticClassificationPlugin/



As Richard said, if your QGIS can access the network, you should see ~800 available plugins in the Plugins -> Manage and Install Plugins menu.

Borys

Same as yours.

Btw, please file a ticket, I just re-tested it now and got the issue again,
this is my workflow:

- Open a project that has no layouts
- Create a new layout through the manager
- Add a label and set id = "my_label"
- Save and close the layout and the manager
- Run python code and:


In [1]: p = QgsProject.instance()

   ...: lom = p.layoutManager()

   ...: lo = lom.layoutByName('Layout 1')

   ...:




In [2]: lo

Out[2]: <qgis._core.QgsPrintLayout at 0x7f981f368d38>

In [4]: lo.itemById('my_label')

Out[4]: <qgis._core.QgsLayoutItem at 0x7f989db01dc8>


In [5]: lo.items()

Out[5]:

[<PyQt5.QtWidgets.QGraphicsRectItem at 0x7f989db01ee8>,

<PyQt5.QtWidgets.QGraphicsLineItem at 0x7f989db01e58>,

<PyQt5.QtWidgets.QGraphicsLineItem at 0x7f989db01f78>,

<PyQt5.QtWidgets.QGraphicsLineItem at 0x7f989da910d8>,

<qgis._core.QgsLayoutItem at 0x7f989db01dc8>,

<PyQt5.QtWidgets.QGraphicsRectItem at 0x7f989da91168>,

<qgis._core.QgsLayoutItemPage at 0x7f989da911f8>]


In [6]: lo.items()

Out[6]:

[<PyQt5.QtWidgets.QGraphicsRectItem at 0x7f989da91318>,

<PyQt5.QtWidgets.QGraphicsRectItem at 0x7f989da91168>,

<qgis._core.QgsLayoutItemPage at 0x7f989da911f8>]


Now, there is  another (possibly unrelated) issue: if I open the layout
again and do nothing but hit "save" and close the layout, when re-running
the code I get a brand new set of QGraphicsLineItem each time I save it.

This looks like a bug to me.

Nothing has changed recently -- this has always been fragile, and the
bug lies deep within the library used to create the Python bindings.

See e.g.

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-Developer-QgsLayout-itemById-returns-wrong-object-td5350947.html

for a workaround

I suspect it's something to do with whether the item was created in
Python or c++.

Thank you Nyall and Allesandro.

So I don't need to file the bus anymore. But who could/would dive into 
this and fix it? And how much would it cost? I might be able to find 
some funding.

For now I will use the workaround.

Raymond

Message-ID: <CA+qEb=01Ny83of95cpCr78V3xTAm0xCD5soSE2T73W-GBO8K=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,
I'm automating map printing in PyQGIS 3 and encountered an issue with
QgsRubberband - the rubberband is not visible on map rendered from composer.

I guess there is a good reason to not to include it, but is there a way to
do so anyway? I just need to mark a very temporary polygon on the map and
place it on exported layout, so creating a memory layer for just one, small
polygon seems to be an overkill for me.

Currently I load a QPT file into QgsLayout and have QgsLayoutItemMap item
in there. Everything renders fine except for the rubberband. I'd appreciate
any hints on that.

Best regards
Adam Borczyk

Hi Adam

I think the idiomatic way to do this would be to rather make (convert rubber bands to) a memory layer with some features that you need displayed for printing and then remove it again after the print is done (aka a redlining layer).

Regards

Tim

Let me kick off some discussions with PyQt upstream, just to confirm
that this is an upstream bug and if so, what would be involved in a
fix.

Hi,
thanks for your answer. Seems memory layer is the only way to go.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] is_layer_active expression
Message-ID: <20180924110519.6a36d969@indien>

Dear Devs,

in QGIS 3 I found the expression "is_layer_active" within the copyright
decoration very useful. I would like to use this expression also within the
print composer, but it seems to be not available there.

Is this correct, are expressions not available all over QGIS within the
expression builder? And how can I get this expression working for the print
composer as well? 

Thanks for any hint.

Hi list,

what is the proper way to stop a very long processing alghorithm running 
in QGIS 3 in a python plugin?
In my plugin under QGIS 2, I assigned to the GeoAlgorithm a custom 
AlgorithmDialog that stops the running thread when the "closing event" 
happens (i.e. when the user clicks on the close button in the dialog).
The long running function is in fact a new object of class QThread (not 
sure that is the best solution but it works perfectly under QGIS 2).
Is there a similar way also in QGIS 3? Are there the equivalents to 
AlgorithmDialog class and the getCustomParametersDialog function of 
GeoAlgorithm?

Thanks,

enrico

Nyall,

Thanks for your confidence and encouragement. I would be interested, but
don't know where to begin. Shape Tools relies on geographiclib which is
slightly more accurate than Vincinty. Geographlib is not a library that is
included with the OSGeo distribution. However, as of the past several years
Proj.4 makes use of geographiclib. I am guessing QGIS has not exposed any
of proj.4's geographiclib routines and I don't know how much of
geographiclib Proj.4 actually uses. Including geographiclib could open up
future opportunities of using some of the Earth's gravity models which are
even more accurate for measuring distances. Using the C++ geographiclib
libraries in the QGIS core would be faster than python only code.

For me to even begin, I need geographiclib as part of the QGIS core. If
there is a path to accomplish this, then we can discuss further details on
what and how to migrate Shape Tools functionality into core.

That should be relatively straightforward. I can do this after 3.4 is
released and feature freeze is lifted. Remind me after this :)

Nyall,

that would be a very welcome addition to QGIS! Let me know if I can be of assistance to you in that regard (I suspect documentation might be the biggest issue…).

Calvin,

The functionality that PROJ exposes from GeographicLib is seen in the geodesic.h header [0]. I am not entirely sure that it’s a one to one representation of the standalone version of the library but I think so. If there’s is something that you need that is missing let me know and I’ll see what I can do about it for the next release of PROJ.


On a related note, I have been meaning to raise a similar issue based on QGIS’s not so accurate polygon-area-on-the-ellipsoid calculations. A colleague of mine came across some differences between QGIS and CARIS LOTS while doing area calculations in relation to a border dispute at sea. After that I tested several popular closed source GIS apps and they all performed better than QGIS. I would have loved to use QGIS to solve this problem but unfortunately had to go with one of the other applications for this. Basing qgsdistancearea.[cpp|h] (probably other ones as well) on GeographicLib should sort that out and bring QGIS at the top of the game :-)

If you have any suggestions I would welcome them.

Shape Tools is fantastic, and plugs a much needed gap in QGIS core
functionality. Lovely work!

Can I strongly encourage you to investigate porting some of these
features/fixes over to QGIS core? You've obviously got the talent and
knowledge to do so, and it'd be great to offer this functionality
out-of-the-box. I'm available for mentoring if you need assistance
with QGIS core development/build setup/general c++ help!

Some expression functions/variables are "context dependent". E.g.
is_layer_visible doesn't make any sense in expressions which aren't
directly associated with a map. So the function won't be available as
for expressions used as a field default value, or for a layout text
label (since the layout may have multiple maps, each with a different
layer set, and a label isn't linked to any map item in particular!).

Wait for 3.4 ;)

Hi Paolo,

I have some rought notes that I can try to polish up a bit and share here.
I'll see if I can find the time for that today. I didn't get to the bottom of
the problem but I am leaning towards the issue being that QGIS uses an
inferior algorithm to determine geodesics. Unfortunately I couldn't find out
from either the source code or the documentation which algorithm is used.
As far as I remember it differs from the otherwise popular algorithm by
Vincenty. That may be because a different algorithm is used or the
Implementation is wrong.

I'll get back with a better write-up later and some test data and results.

/Kristian

Ok, PR opened. https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8016

But for reference -- I think what's going to be more useful for layout
use is the 3.4 @map_layers variable. As noted in the earlier reply,
some functions are context dependent, and is_layer_visible is one of
these. So in 3.4 it will work *within* a layout item map, it won't
allow you to e.g. have a label item outside the map change its content
based on is_layer_visible.

On the other hand, you *can* retrieve expression variables (not
functions!) from another layout item, using the item_variables
function! So you can build the expression:

   map_get( item_variables( 'Your_Map_ID' ), 'map_layers' )

To retrieve a list of map layers within the Your_Map_Id map item, and
this expression will work anywhere inside the layout! (i.e. labels,
data defined expressions, etc).

One intended use case for this is to allow labels with expressions like:

   array_to_string( array_foreach(map_get( item_variables(
'Your_Map_ID' ), 'map_layers' ), layer_property(@element, 'name')),
',' )

To get a nice comma separated list of all layers included in the map
item. (Admittedly, that expression is quite complex, but if you pick
it apart piece by piece you should be able to decipher it!).

We use a direct port from GRASS:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsdistancearea.cpp#L690

vs GRASS upstream:

https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/trunk/lib/gis/area_poly1.c?rev=71260

It's not very stable for very small areas -- better to use cartesian
calculations there. Or bring in geographiclib and punt the
responsibility elsewhere ;)

It's not a small area, that's why I have been nitpicking ellipsoid area calculation
algorithms!
I did end up doing the calculations with geographiblib to get a reference to judge
various other calculations by. It's a pain in the butt to extract the data from a
polygon shapefile (or whatever) and format it to suit the planimeter app of
geographiclib. It would be so much cooler if I could get the same results by
clicking info on a polygon in QGIS :-)

Hi all (sorry for the cross-posting but it's because the call was made if
I'm not wrong on all the three channels)

Thanks to those that already applied and happy to see that Documentation
repo will likely be lively in upcoming weeks.
If that can help to attract more people, these are some of the main areas I
feel the documentation is far behind (or the features I think would be
worth describing in priority in official manuals - not sorted):

* 3D formats and features: up to now no word has been written about
although I think this could be an attractive feature
* the user profiles behavior: another big change on the settings philosophy
that impact everybody and would deserve some literature
* the processing system and particularly "graphical modeler": The
algorithms, and particularly native ones, are well covered, But the
Processing options and more important the modelers are less behind imho
* the QGIS Server: can't really tell how the doc is in this area but there
are a lot of pending issues in the repo
* the print layout reporting
* attribute table and custom forms/widgets
* unfortunately as usual, the PyQGIS doc ...
* ... and the data source manager dialog (particularly some of the tabs at
the bottom of the dialog)
* and of course, any other area you think you know better...

Some ideas for those willing to apply and write docs.

Hope that helps,
Harrissou

Right, here are the calculated areas as returned by a number of different GIS applications and the planimeter app of GeographicLib for reference:

Caris LOTS: 14.737 km^2
ArcMap:     14.727,446 km^2
MapInfo:    14.727,352 km^2
GeoMedia:   14.726,443 km^2
Planimeter: 14.722,522 km^2
QGIS 3.2:   14.652,181 km^2
QGIS 2.8:   14.652,181 km^2

The polygon that I have used to get the numbers above can be found here: https://gist.github.com/kbevers/207b5bcb9be20e7554abe5f56742ec2c

I am quite confident that GeographicLib delivers the most accurate result (if you have doubts, this reference [0] should convince you). As can be seen from the table above all but QGIS come fairly close. I expect some variation in the results as these are numerical approximations, although I think QGIS is too far of the mark. My suspicion is that the geodesic algorithm used by QGIS (and apparently GRASS) is to blame here.

We use a direct port from GRASS:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsdistancearea.cpp#L690

vs GRASS upstream:

https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/trunk/lib/gis/area_poly1.c?rev=71260

It's not very stable for very small areas -- better to use cartesian
calculations there. Or bring in geographiclib and punt the
responsibility elsewhere ;)

Kristian,

Thanks for those calculations. Before this discussion I was contemplating
doing a line and polygon measurement tool for Shape Tools by clicking on an
existing shape and using geographiclib calculate the measurements, but if
it is possible to replace the existing QGIS measuring functions and
Vincinty with geographiclib, then I will hold off. Shape Tools uses
geographiclib for all its calculations and I am pleased with it. In the
last release I included a function to measure all geometry on a layer.

I don't know who has the most accurate algorithm. I just checked Google
Earth and it measures your polygon at 14,672 km^2. I'm guessing Google
Earth is not as accurate as some of those other applications. As far as I
know geographiclib has the most accurate ellipsoid calculations. The only
thing better would be to include elevation. I'm not an expert in this area,
but would the gravity models provide more accuracy?

Calvin,

I am quite sure that Charles Karney holds an undisputed claim of the Most Accurate Geodesic Algorithm™. At least I haven’t come across any papers offering better accuracy.

Google Earths figure of 14.672 km^2 is very similar to MapInfos spherical area calculation of 14.670 km^2, so for now I think we can assume that Google’s Earth is not subject to either rotation nor gravity :-)

Regarding including the gravity (geoid) models in GeographicLib I must admit that that is outside my knowledge of the library. If the library can calculate geodesics on the geoid that would be even more accurate, yes. Although you are at the mercy of the accuracy of the geoid models. For my particular application I wouldn’t use one since the global models mention in the docs you link to are not that well-fitting in this area. In theory I could produce a grid from a better geoid model. While an interesting problem to handle I think it is taking it just a step too far.

It's not a small area, that's why I have been nitpicking ellipsoid area calculation
algorithms!
I did end up doing the calculations with geographiblib to get a reference to judge
various other calculations by. It's a pain in the butt to extract the data from a
polygon shapefile (or whatever) and format it to suit the planimeter app of
geographiclib. It would be so much cooler if I could get the same results by
clicking info on a polygon in QGIS :-)

We use a direct port from GRASS:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsdistancearea.cpp#L690

vs GRASS upstream:

https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/trunk/lib/gis/area_poly1.c?rev=71260

It's not very stable for very small areas -- better to use cartesian
calculations there. Or bring in geographiclib and punt the
responsibility elsewhere ;)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Exporting from QGIS to CAD format - is it possible
	to offer DWG export
Message-ID: <003e01d454f8$292ee9f0$7b8cbdd0$@gmail.com>

Hi, 

 

The CAD import and export functions for QGIS 3x are already extremely
impressive and in several ways exceed the import/export capability of ArcGIS
desktop 10.5/6. 

 

As mentioned in a previous post the only function that the QGIS import can't
handle yet is when the CAD file (dwg or dxf) is not georeferenced
beforehand. For that scenario I regrettably have to go back to ArcGIS
desktop.

 

My question pertains to the export. 

 

Is there a proprietary licensing reason that QGIS cannot export directly to
*.dwg file format rather than only to the dxf format?

 

I have a colleague that regularly espouses the view that QGIS is not up to
par when it comes to handling CAD files, as compared to ArcGIS desktop,
simply because of Q's inability to export directly to a dwg file format. Can
this capability be added?

 

Regards

Rob

Hi Harrissou,

thanks for reporting your ideas, probably nobody knows better than you
"black areas" of the docs.

What do other docs people think? I don't want to put too much wood in
the fire, but maybe if we all agree, we can think to add some priority
labels depending on the lack of documented (interested) features.

QGIS doc repo already has a lot (too much?!) labels, but maybe having a
kind of hierarchy could help.

Thanks

Matteo

You'd have to do some fragile code to do this. Basically:

- get designer window from designer.view()'s parent window
- find the mActionAtlasPreview child action in the window
- manually toggle it on

This should work, but isn't stable API - so is likely to break ;)

A better approach is to (quickly, before 3.4 final!) file a PR
exposing the toggle atlas preview behavior to
QgsLayoutDesignerInterface. Then you'll be able to just do:

designer = iface.openLayoutDesigner( layout )
designer.toggleAtlasPreview( True )

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Updating a layer's datasource in python
Message-ID: <CAExk7p1HJLTHvtabrAK6ZafRZ0x_Bz+i5wV1QNu2pDrVWSxVEg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

As simple as it sounds, I'm struggling with changing the datasource of
layers with python :

layer1 = QgsVectorLayer('/path/to/a.shp')
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(layer1)
layer1.dataProvider().setDataSourceUri('/path/to/b.shp')

The layer successfully changes on map redraw. However layer1.source() stays
to the initial layer, so that the change does not persist across saves
(save and reload, and you get a.shp again).

The exact same code with a geopackage doesn't work at all (no changes on
map redraw).

layer1 = QgsVectorLayer('/path/to/db.gpkg|layer=a')
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(layer1)
layer1.dataProvider().setDataSourceUri ('/path/to/db.gpkg|layer=b')

There is also an entry in the pyqgis cookbook (here
<https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/loadlayer.html#id1>,
scroll down) for QgsVectorLayer. The layer1.source() is correctly updated,
but again, it works with shapefiles, but not geopackages. And this is for
vectors only.

layer1.setDataSource('/path/to/b.shp', "b", "ogr")

Am I hitting a bug ? Or did I get confused somewhere ?

As I feel this is a fairly common need, I'd be very grateful if someone
could help me figure out the recommended way to achieve this, for both
vectors or rasters. I'll update the pyqgis cookbook in return :-)

Note that there are workarounds (like replacing with a new layer and
copying styles over or writing directly to the .qgs file, but they are not
straightforward and have limitations).

Thanks !!

Olivier

This code won't work correctly -- you shouldn't be changing the data
source of the layer's provider, but rather set the layer's data source
and let it handle the required changes to the provider.

> There is also an entry in the pyqgis cookbook (here, scroll down) for QgsVectorLayer. The layer1.source() is correctly updated, but again, it works with shapefiles, but not geopackages. And this is for vectors only.

This should work for geopackage (as well as shp). Can you share your code?

And yes, there's unfortunately no equivalent for rasters yet.

Hi Olivier,

I have been playing with this and I think you should use the source on the
layer and not on the data provider.
Here is some code (which also modifies the style of the layer)
https://github.com/QGEP/customizer/blob/master/customizer.py#L129-L141

I was doing a layer.reload() after changing the source.

Hope that helps,
Denis

We could probably also use libdxfrw, that we use for our import, to write DWG.

But contentwise DXF and DWG are alike - and there's more software that can read
DXF than DWG.  Is using DXF not an option?  Do you require a certain
version of DWG (the format changed quite a bit, although the content
actually didn't that much).

You could use the ODA File-Converter to convert dwg to dxf and vice-versa. 
https://www.opendesign.com/guestfiles/oda_file_converter 

It can also run as batch-process. 
Runs natively on Linux/Mac/Windows, 32&64 Bit.
It's Freeware, AFAIK. 
That way you can guarantee it will always be able to read and write the latest DWGs. 


You can also use the Teigha Online File Converter, which converts .dwg/.dxf files to PDF/BMP.
https://www.opendesign.com/teigha_online_converter 


You cannot currently have a free program that reads and writes DWG on its own. 
DWG is a proprietary file format, on purpose designed to be difficult to understand, and it's encrypted. 
To be able to flawlessly read and write DWGs, you need to reverse-engineer the AutoCAD file format, by reverse-engineering AutoCAD. 
This naturally takes a lot of time, which means there are no Free-Software DWG libraries that implement a sufficiently large subset of the AutoCAD file format. 
There are currently only two software applications that offer a reliable DWG interface. 
One is ODA Teigha for C++/Java/.NET. 
The other is Woutware CADlib.

The problem with ODA-Teigha ist hat it takes royalties for each and every application deployed with Teigha. 
Which would be deadly for a free software project. 

WoutWare is better in this respect, as it requires a one-time license of currently 1'208 USD/year per developer. 
Also, Teigha is a pain in the ass to use. 
The problem with WoutWare is, that you need a new license each time you need to download a new version of WoutWare because there was a new version of AutoCAD. 
Also, WoutWare is .NET and therefore currently only works on Windows. 
There is a preview release of WoutWare for .NET Core (which works on Linux, and presumably on OSX too). 
.NET Core can be self-containedly deployed (Windows, Linux, Mac) , so there are no dependencies on a certain version of the .NET-Framwork. 

Those are the two only (working) options when you deal with DWG.

The logging call does not show up on the console and I also see that my provider is offered on WMS layers, but also on some local vector layers (which is not what I intend). grep'ping around the QGIS' source code I could not find some place where this method would be called and used, so I'm wondering if this is implemented.

I have looked into the code and figured out that both of these issues
seem like bugs in the implementation. The supportLayer() method indeed
seems unused (my test implementation always returned true, that

Message-ID: <CABPxTToDg8krrabue6xXA=iBFWES-2y+E70raxfwz7HQ9Vh8Vg@mail.gmail.com>

I had a user request Circular Lines in the Shape Tools plugin and they gave
the following example.

https://www.stayaspensnowmass.com/sites/default/files/aspenFlightMap.jpg

I don't know how one would do this type of drawing. Does anyone have any
ideas? It draws the lines trying to avoid overlapping other lines in a very
pleasing manner. Doing this is probably outside the scope of the Shape
Tools plugin, but I just wanted to ask to see if there is a relatively easy
algorithmic way of drawing these types of lines between two points.

Thanks,

Hi,

Even if the discussion already moved on, for the record below some more numbers from other OSGeo tools:
PostGIS (in UTM 33N): 14727443738.0 m2
GRASS 7.4 (in WGS84): 14707741818.0911
GRASS 7.4 (in UTM33): between 14707741818.0911 m2 and 14727443738.0262 m2 (depending on how much one densifies vertices on the boundaries during reprojection, the latter value measured without boundary vertex densification)

Please see also: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/12057 for earlier discussion of area calculations in QGIS...
And https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/ticket/3356 for recent changes in area calculations in GRASS.

Cheers
Stefan

Right, here are the calculated areas as returned by a number of different GIS applications and the planimeter app of GeographicLib for reference:

Caris LOTS: 14.737 km^2
ArcMap:     14.727,446 km^2
MapInfo:    14.727,352 km^2
GeoMedia:   14.726,443 km^2
Planimeter: 14.722,522 km^2
QGIS 3.2:   14.652,181 km^2
QGIS 2.8:   14.652,181 km^2

The polygon that I have used to get the numbers above can be found here: https://gist.github.com/kbevers/207b5bcb9be20e7554abe5f56742ec2c

I am quite confident that GeographicLib delivers the most accurate result (if you have doubts, this reference [0] should convince you). As can be seen from the table above all but QGIS come fairly close. I expect some variation in the results as these are numerical approximations, although I think QGIS is too far of the mark. My suspicion is that the geodesic algorithm used by QGIS (and apparently GRASS) is to blame here.

It's not a small area, that's why I have been nitpicking ellipsoid area calculation algorithms!
I did end up doing the calculations with geographiblib to get a reference to judge various other calculations by. It's a pain in the butt to extract the data from a polygon shapefile (or whatever) and format it to suit the planimeter app of geographiclib. It would be so much cooler if I could get the same results by clicking info on a polygon in QGIS :-)

We use a direct port from GRASS:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsdistancearea.cpp#L690

vs GRASS upstream:

https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/trunk/lib/gis/area_poly1.c?rev=71260

It's not very stable for very small areas -- better to use cartesian calculations there. Or bring in geographiclib and punt the responsibility elsewhere ;)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Exporting from QGIS to CAD format - is it
	possible to offer DWG export
Message-ID: <001501d455e0$e3e778a0$abb669e0$@gmail.com>

Thanks Jürgen,

I can see why DXF might be more flexible given more software can open/import it, as compared to DWG. I have even made this argument to my co-workers. However, we have to convert to and from DWG on a daily basis (to and from QGIS or ArcGIS). When we export to DXF we have the extra step of opening the DXF in a full version of AutoCAD and then saving it as a DWG so our project managers can send on to clients who forward it to engineers and planners that prefer working with AutoCAD. I have to admit that this extra time adds up.

I am fine with this extra step but our managers have used this minor extra step as a reason to recommend we continue to pay our annual ESRI licensing fees whereas I want to free up this money to support QGIS and its development. 

The format of DWG seems to change every 2 or 3 releases. For example, my AutoDesk AutoCAD 2016 saves as AutoCAD 2013 (*.dwg) format but I know the latest AutoCAD 2019 saves a new version level.

If you were able to use the libdxfrw to write DWG and there was a way to offer a choice to export as DWG or DXF than I think one could really argue that QGIS was a one stop shop for converting to and from CAD format.

Not sure if the limitations mentioned by Stefan (thanks for those) are problematic

Rob

We could probably also use libdxfrw, that we use for our import, to write DWG.

But contentwise DXF and DWG are alike - and there's more software that can read DXF than DWG.  Is using DXF not an option?  Do you require a certain version of DWG (the format changed quite a bit, although the content actually didn't that much).

You could use the ODA File-Converter to convert dwg to dxf and vice-versa. 
https://www.opendesign.com/guestfiles/oda_file_converter 

It can also run as batch-process. 
Runs natively on Linux/Mac/Windows, 32&64 Bit.
It's Freeware, AFAIK. 
That way you can guarantee it will always be able to read and write the latest DWGs. 


You can also use the Teigha Online File Converter, which converts .dwg/.dxf files to PDF/BMP.
https://www.opendesign.com/teigha_online_converter 


You cannot currently have a free program that reads and writes DWG on its own. 
DWG is a proprietary file format, on purpose designed to be difficult to understand, and it's encrypted. 
To be able to flawlessly read and write DWGs, you need to reverse-engineer the AutoCAD file format, by reverse-engineering AutoCAD. 
This naturally takes a lot of time, which means there are no Free-Software DWG libraries that implement a sufficiently large subset of the AutoCAD file format. 
There are currently only two software applications that offer a reliable DWG interface. 
One is ODA Teigha for C++/Java/.NET. 
The other is Woutware CADlib.

The problem with ODA-Teigha ist hat it takes royalties for each and every application deployed with Teigha. 
Which would be deadly for a free software project. 

WoutWare is better in this respect, as it requires a one-time license of currently 1'208 USD/year per developer. 
Also, Teigha is a pain in the ass to use. 
The problem with WoutWare is, that you need a new license each time you need to download a new version of WoutWare because there was a new version of AutoCAD. 
Also, WoutWare is .NET and therefore currently only works on Windows. 
There is a preview release of WoutWare for .NET Core (which works on Linux, and presumably on OSX too). 
.NET Core can be self-containedly deployed (Windows, Linux, Mac) , so there are no dependencies on a certain version of the .NET-Framwork. 

Those are the two only (working) options when you deal with DWG.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] OSGeo4W Gdal meta package and Python init
Message-ID: <CAEDrt38OYsU2UtKvCVe5deOk6HX_v+uk51W11a4FFaGpqMnN7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to use GDAL and Python3 from OSGeo4W in my application and I
have the following questions:

1. As I'm targeting only Python3 (using python3-gdal-2.2.4-1.tar.bz2), I
was wandering if I need to provide also the Python27 for the gdal-python
scripts (gdal-python-2.2.4-2.tar.bz2) ?
Are they all the gdal-python scripts Python3 compatible? If so, why does
gdal-python-2.2.4-2.tar.bz2 include the Python27 libs/site-packages and not
in a separate file as for Python3?

2. I'm trying to figure out a way to start my app without setting an
additional mandatory env-variable (PYTHONHOME) globally or with a batch
file, so far I could only start it with the following batch file:

set OSGEO4W_ROOT=%~dp0\OSGeo4W-org
set PYTHONHOME=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\python36
myapp.exe

Otherwise my app crushes upon Python DLL initialization.

I tried to set PYTHONHOME with the SetEnvironmentVariable function but
although I get the correct value with GetEnvironmentVariable, (the same as
with the env-varialbe method), my app still crushes upon the DLL
initialization.
I understand it must be possible because somehow starting qgis-bin.exe
works (I guess it has to do with the qgis-bin.env file, but how does it
work?

I had no problem using the official Python3.6 distribution (I guess because
PYTHONHOME is the same as the python3.dll  folder)

3. I could not find GDAL/Python27/Python36 meta packages (as there is for
QGIS) to install GDAL or Python and their dependencies.
After a research I could pull out the following dependency list for GDAL
and the package list for Python3, how can I make meta packages out of them
so it would be easier to download/install?

Thanks for the feedback.

I've opened the relevant tickets in the bug tracker:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19960
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19964

Might take a stab at a fix myself, if I can spare some free time.

gdal-python is for python2
python3-gdal for python3

Which is also what you need to install to get the bindings and the required
dependencies (except for optional parts a gdal-ecw, gdal-oracle etc.)

That is actually done by QGIS itself.  QGIS's postinstall runs the qgis*bat
with --postinstall argument, which in turn will read the qgis*.vars file, which
has a list of environment variables that are required to run qgis and dumps
them to the qgis*.env file.  The latter is then used whenever the exe is
started directly - for instance to make it pinnable (see src/app/mainwin.cpp).

To enable python3 you need to call py3_env.bat.  That will also add the scripts
directory of python3 to the path, which has the python3 versions of the gdal
scripts.  However the wrapper batch files (eg.  gdal_merge.bat) are only
generated in gdal-python and use python2.

Hmm... confusing. I've double checked and the QGIS/GRASS code matches,
so we should get identical results. The cause must lie in the data
passed to the area calculation. I'll investigate.

A possible explanation could be that QGIS doesn't pick up the correct ellipsoid definition from the CRS metadata. I had a hunch that might be the problem but couldn’t come up with a test to confirm it. I suspect it would be simple to test in debug mode.

Hi Helmut,

I'm struggling to work out where the difference lies between the code
paths. Do you mind sharing the values from the st state struct when
G_ellipsoid_polygon_area is called for this polygon?

Hi,

Matteo, I was just listing the areas I had in mind but I agree with you: we
should prioritize the issues. I think we should use paid program to tackle
what are more relevant to the project and setting a priority of what we
think should be documented is a necessary step. This will help to
concentrate and "guide" the upcoming writers.

We already have labels to handle that (blocker, high priority, even low
priority); they just need to be applied to the retained features/areas.

Regards,
Harrissou

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] form font barely readable
Message-ID: <37e56027-53b1-47b0-991d-274bbc09ce7b@duif.net>

Hi,

Using the I-tool and viewing via 'Auto open form', the attributes of a
feature are barely readable (see attached screenshot).
Making the layer editable make the font go to normal black. I understand
the idea is to make it more clear that these are NOT editable.

It is slightly better on Windows, but personally I would prefer to make
it more readable?

What do others think?

Regards,

Richard

PS I know earlier we had such a discussion about non-visible layer items
in the legend...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Buffer Algorithm (Buffer distance of output
 polygon is not equal to the Distance parameter)
Message-ID: <CAFAduOTXODexEH2dSCd9B=8fgir_B3FgyUjuQ60kosEHtpS-Og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone.

I apologize if this has been asked before but I would just like to clarify
if this is how the buffer algorithm in QGIS should function.

*Issue:* The actual distance from the input layer to the buffer polygon
created by the Buffer processing tool (and v.buffer) is not equal (only
around 80%) to the Distance parameter provided in the said tool.

*Example:* My coordinate reference system is WGS84/UTM Zone 51N (EPSG:
32651). I create a 100m buffer around a point but when I measure the
resulting circle, its edge is only ~80m from the point (see buffer-point
and buffer-point-distance below).

 buffer-point-distance.png
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aQ0mfadGnEzISkPnu-GGX9SUu1GXhGMs/view?usp=drive_web>

I create a 50m buffer around a line but when I measure the resulting
buffer, its edge is only ~40m from the line (see line-buffer and
line-buffer-distance below).

 line-buffer-distance.png
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PGRabSqF-zrOCpAboncQ_yQxx_0ulByN/view?usp=drive_web>


Clarifications will be much appreciated. Maybe I just missed some part of
the documentation.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Ben Hur

Message-ID: <05bfdc0e-8bf9-82eb-2593-319695f8fc50@faunalia.it>

Hi all,

I keep on getting the above error when editing or deleting points from
Lizmap 3.1.4 on latest qgis LTR, PostGIS 2.5.

Inserting new points works smoothly. From the error log I only get:

Any hint?

Thanks.

That's odd. I redid the entire thing just now (restarted QGIS, made scratch
point layer, created a 100m buffer) and the values I get are now correct.
Even the area computations were off in the first one but after redoing the
process, everything looks good.

Weird. Maybe I missed something during the first one. Hahaha.

Anyway, sorry for bothering you all.

Cheers!

I am resending this since I did not include everyone.

I wrote a little script that calculates the area using geographiclib in
QGIS. You need to have the Shape Tools plugin installed and then change the
path accordingly in the script. You also need to have the polygon layer
selected in QGIS because it is looking for the active layer and it only
pulls out the first polygon. You can run it from the python console. Here
are the results running it on your polygon.

num   = 4017
perim = 503.3782852369916 km
area  = -14737.935340098571 km^2

It is interesting that the area is negative. It must be the direction that
he points are added. This value corresponds to Caris LOTS.

Stefan,

You mentioned getting different results when you densify the polygon. The
results should be the same. With geographiclib all distances are based on
geodesic shortest paths between vertices to calculate the area. I tried
your experiment but used a geodesic densifier on the polygon, calculated
the area, and in both cases they were almost identical. The only difference
was way down in the noise. What this tells me is that whatever densify
algorithms you were using, they were not geodesic.

Regards

Oh this has bugged me a LOT too! I'd very much like to see this

missing...

Hi, All

I try to visualize the numpy.array matrix 'm' as a raster layer from Qgis.  Because I have to show the matrix dynamically, I  do not want to save the raster to *.tif file.
Is there any way to do this.   I can create raster dataset using gdal library, but do not know how to create a raster layer to show on Qgis window.  The code is as follows.  Thank you so much!

def show_matrix_as_raster(self, m, lng_min, lat_min, pixelWidth, pixelHeight):
    cols = m.shape[1]
    rows = m.shape[0]

    driver = gdal.GetDriverByName('MEM')
    outRaster = driver.Create('', cols, rows, 1, gdal.GDT_Byte)   # create dataset in memory
    outRaster.SetGeoTransform((lng_min, pixelWidth, 0, lat_min, 0, pixelHeight))
   outband = outRaster.GetRasterBand(1)
    outband.WriteArray(m)
    outRasterSRS = osr.SpatialReference()
    outRasterSRS.ImportFromEPSG(4326)
    outRaster.SetProjection(outRasterSRS.ExportToWkt())
    outband.FlushCache()

   layer = QgsRasterLayer( file_name_???, layer_name)    # how to create QgsRsterLayer from 'outRaster', rather than file?
   QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer( layer )

    ###### render
    ##
    myGrayRenderer = QgsSingleBandGrayRenderer(layer.dataProvider(), 1)
    layer.setRenderer(myGrayRenderer)
    renderer = layer.renderer()
    uses_band = renderer.usesBands()

    myType = renderer.dataType(uses_band[0])
    myEnhancement = QgsContrastEnhancement(myType)
    contrast_enhancement = QgsContrastEnhancement.StretchToMinimumMaximum
    myEnhancement.setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm(contrast_enhancement, True)

    myEnhancement.setMinimumValue(m.min())
    myEnhancement.setMaximumValue(m.max())

    layer.renderer().setContrastEnhancement(myEnhancement)
    layer.renderer().setOpacity(0.5)
    layer.triggerRepaint()

    if layer.isValid() is False:
        print "Unable to show the raster layer."


Best regards!
Liye,

Thanks René. I don't understand why this is so.

I don't see anything particularly wrong with maplayer. The project is
very simple, just two layers. Anything I should check?

Thanks again.

Looking into this a little, we use make the widget 'enabled=false' I think?

What about instead only do 'readOnly=true'?
Then you 'miss' the visual cue that a form field is read only.
There could be a message when you try to edit the field?

Or in combination with 'frame=false' you would get a form in which the
fields do not like 'input fields'.

Mmm, was trying to look into this, to find out that we use a wrapper
around the widgets:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/qgsattributeform.cpp#L1077

Removing the
ww->setEnabled( enabled );
morphs the input in the default input of QGIS
ww does not have readonly or frame anymore

So more difficult then I hoped :-(

Richard

That sounds like an idea.

Have a look here, that's the default behavior with setEnabled, where the
actual modification of the widget is done:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/editorwidgets/core/qgseditorwidgetwrapper.cpp#L65

it needs to be checked with all different widgets if they are still in a
sane and expected readonly state. If one is not, the behavior can be
finetuned in their respective wrapper, as done e.g. here
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/editorwidgets/qgsrelationreferencewidgetwrapper.cpp#L136

Cheers

Matthias

Ok, I actually did fiddle here a little:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/editorwidgets/qgstexteditwrapper.cpp#L140

There we set a 'Disabled'-Palette on the text.
If I comment that line you get the top dialog as seen in attached
'defaultPalette2.png'.
So: a 'normal' line-edit... which could make a user try to edit it...
Though (see the bottom dialog in the same image) we have more
differences now since we use the wrappers: we show a 'clear-button' in
the lineEdit if we are editable now).

I also tried to remove the frame (see topNoFrame_bottomCurrent2.png) here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/editorwidgets/qgstexteditwrapper.cpp#L198
In the image to me it looks a little 'naked'.
For reference in the same image the bottom dialog is current situation;
in my view badly readable....

To me it is actually ok to use the normal palette, I do not like the
view of a lineedit withouth frame I think.

So what do others think?

Regards,

Richard

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Python API for 3D
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFc8Fpp71N0Dddb0kCbWHR7uYQ6y+ZLCvewyrz1ESBd1dQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have been thinking it would be good to finally have Python API also
for qgis_3d library. Until now I have kept the 3D library
intentionally without Python bindings so that it is possible to move
the code around without being blocked by the API stability
requirement.

I think for the time being we should still treat the 3D library as
having unstable API - so I wanted to check how others would feel about
having Python API for qgis_3d that would be marked as unstable, i.e.
there may be changes between 3.x releases? I think with big warnings
in the docs that the API may change we can get others to experiment
with 3D functionality while not offending anyone too much if we break
it later. The idea is that the API would get frozen at some point
later in 3.x release cycle or for QGIS 4.

Hi Martin,

I think it's a good idea!

... if the warning is big enough and not light gray over a white background
;)

I don't really have any concrete plans for API changes within the 3D
library - I just feel that it may easily happen in the future as we will be
adding more functionality or refactoring existing code :-)

Anyway I would try to keep the changes in API break docs so that devs have
some guidance in case there are some breaks.

I don't see an issue with this -- there's other parts of code exposed
to PyQGIS which is also clearly marked as non-stable. Some processing
classes for instance.

Hi,

Trying to build on Windows for master I'm getting the following:

C:\OSGeo4W\bin\hdf5.dll : fatal error LNK1107: invalid or corrupt file:
cannot read at 0x2B0

It looks like cmake is trying to use that in the scripts and not the lib
file but I can't see why it wants to do that.

Any thoughts?

Did not got that working using a palette, but using

mLineEdit->setStyleSheet( QStringLiteral("background-color:
rgba(255,255,255,0%);" ) );

I got the results attached (so adding 0%, 50%, 75% alpha to a white
background).

I'm Actually pretty happy with the 75% one, as it is still clear what
the fields-values are, but it also definitely not an input field anymore.

I'll create a PR so others can test discuss or test on windows/mac...

Regards,

Richard

PS related: am I the only one which if I open the Identify Results
docked, I never see the Value because it is lined much too much to the
right? Have the pull the field-divider to the left to see the values...
Is there a possibility to for example start with 50%/50% columns instead?

Message-ID: <b53b4007-c177-acc0-45db-51fd10eaf9ce@duif.net>

Hi,

Thanks to some devs and Aleix Pol @aleixpol in particular, there is a
(for me working!) flatpak available for QGIS 3.2.x on flathub:

https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.qgis.qgis

Short intro: https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#flatpak

Try test and create issues here https://github.com/flathub/org.qgis.qgis
if you encounter some flathub related issues..

I think it is a nice addition for fresh Linux users to easily install
and try out QGIS, independent of lib/qt/gdal/whatever versions

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Note this touches on discussion at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8054 too. Quoting:

"Maybe we should do qt approach and have "technology preview" classes,
before classes mature? We could even do this as a general rule - new
classes are tech previews for 2 minor releases."

Thanks Aleix and the other devs for the excellent work!

I confirm that it's working well, at least on my Fedora 28 and 29beta.

I had only issues with plugins that are requiring extra Python dependencies
which are not available in the flatpak image (like scipy and matplotlib).
I was able to find a workaround which is to extract the corresponding
python wheels (for the proper python version, cp35) in the python folder
under the application user storage (which is located under $HOME/.var/);
that path is already part of sys.path.

There's any better way to address that?

Cheers,
Daniele

Right, an annoying issue. Could other flatpacks be used, or should py
libs be bundled?

Otherwise, a nice a quick way to install, thanks a lot!

All the best.

I think flatpak is in the same boat as Windows (non osgeo4w-users) and
Mac users: different python(path) for QGIS.

Best solution I heard earlier (Ale?) is to (re)use pip. From [0]: "pip
is the preferred installer program. Starting with Python 3.4, it is
included by default with the Python binary installers."

Any Python guru's willing to dive into a plan?
Maybe a small interface to run pip from withing QGIS?
Or include a partial pip string in the metadata.txt of installers?
Taking into account already configured proxy/certs?

Richard Duivenvoorde
