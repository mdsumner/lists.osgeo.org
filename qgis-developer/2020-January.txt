Hi Mars,

In Settings > Options > Digitizing, What is your search radius fro vertex
edits? I use 10 Pixels and it works fine with me.

Besides, in case you don't know, for that kind of task, you can use the
reshape tool instead, in the advanced digitizing toolbar.

Hi Giovanna,
probably you need to load SpatiaLite as an extension module https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=mod_spatialite before the "SELECT InitSpatialMetaData(1);" statement:

con.execute("SELECT load_extension('mod_spatialite')")

Best regards.

Andrea

Message-ID: <d920dad7-b3fb-7f97-a01a-d36745e92adc@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Wanted to show 'Atlas' functionality here to somebody, but... not
working. Tried master and 3.10 on Linux and 3.6 on Windows.

What I did:
- open a WmS layer
- create a shp file with 3 polygons
- create a layouter with only a map item
- create an atlas

Output (whatever output I try: pdf or images) always end up as 3 the
same pages (the view I had in the layouter).
The Atlas does not 'follow' the 3 polygons...

Do I miss something?
Is it working with you?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Did you check the "Controlled by Atlas" checkbox in the Map item properties?

Ah, duh...

Thanks Raymond, that is pretty hidden.... see screendump.

Would be cool to get a message like "hey, you are asking me to generate
an atlas but I do not have any map controlled by Map, should I use the
(only) map I have? Not sure if it is easy to check for this property...

Feature Request :-) ?

> Map control is not a requirement for atlas. This setting controls the map
extent, and zooms (somehow!) to the atlas feature. But you can do atlas
without necessarily change the map extent.
Eg, let's take a map item zoomed on Europe extent, with countries. Keeping
that map extent, you can do an atlas that iterate over the country layer
and highlight the current atlas feature using a different symbology (eg,
$id = @atlas_featureid).
Or the atlas can be to filter some attribute table features... and the
coverage layer is not necessarily a geometric input, it can be a simple
table.

Thank you Alexandre,

Yes, I should mention 10 pixels is default on my system, I have also tried
20px up to 40px testing incase of High DPI issue.
I have tried tossing out my QGIS 3 Profile, and thought that fixed the
issue, but found it creeping back in again.
Clean build of QGIS 3.10.1 w/no extra plugins in my Testing User-land.

I absolutely agree, the Reshape Tool works nicely when dealing with
bisecting edits, and when not, a few node changes.

I am just curious, since it appears I am in a distinct minority with this
issue, all through various MacOS updates, Laptops, desktops, 3.4.x, 3.6.x,
3.8.x, 3.10.x

Hi all,
I am trying to open the layout designer with the first Layout of the project and Zoom to full, but it only works after I click the second time. I think the problem is that I am not waiting for layout map render to finish (Please see the code below)
Does anyone can help me?

Best regards,
Jorge Almerio
        
project = QgsProject.instance()         manager = project.layoutManager() layouts_list = manager.printLayouts() 
if layouts_list:            l_out = layouts_list[0]
            self.iface.openLayoutDesigner(layout=l_out)
            designer = iface.openLayoutDesigners()[0]            
            designer.window().showMaximized()
            designer.view().zoomFull()else:
            self.iface.messageBar().pushMessage("Uteis: ", self.tr('There is No Layout defined!'), level=Qgis.Warning, duration=5)

Hi,

Since yesterday, installing QGIS release dev or QGIS dev is failing because
of missing proj_6_3.dll.

PROJ 6.3.0 was released on January 1, but the version in OSGeo4W is still
the 6.2.1.

Will it be updated soon?

Hi all,

I'm working on adding refresh action to OGC services in QGIS, compiling QGIS
master and doing a refresh on postgres data provider connection item while a
WMS connection item is open and there are changes ( from WMS Server ) in WMS
layer items will cause a QGIS crash.

I was able to reproduce the same issue in QGIS 3.4 and QGIS 3.10. Does
anyone confirm?

Hello Devs,

I would like to present a custom dialog when a feature is clicled. The dialog must look and behave like QgsAttributeDialog except that two specific fields must be disabled (or hidden).

How could I programatically disable (or hide) certain fields in the QgsAttributeDialog?

Best regards,
Tej

Hi

Why not use the QGIS drag and drop form designer? It takes care of exactly this kind of use case. See chapter 3 in my tutorial here:

Hi Tim,

It has to be done programmatically, via a plug-in. The form fields which have to be remain disabled are known beforehand. The name and types of the remaining activated fields are not known beforehand. So I cannot use the drag and drop UI.

Would be happy to hear of way around this.

Best regards,
Tej

Message-ID: <c7a564f2-8a24-aa6e-88f8-7d1ff03f2219@terglobo.nl>

Many icons in QGIS have little shields specifying what kind of action 
they represents, like adding, editing and removing. For removing and 
deleting things, I found 3 different shields though, a cross, a traffic 
sign and a minus.

What is the logic for these 3? A difference in removing or deleting or 
hiding maybe?
Or is this just caused by QGIS's evolution? In that case, what should be 
the right shield to use now?

See attached screenshot

Thanks!
Raymond

Dear Raymond,

The initial idea creating GIS icons set was to define generic actions.

1. Remove
https://github.com/Cracert/GIS-icons/blob/master/24x24/layer-remove.png
Non-destructive operation.
You add a layer to composition, then you remove it.

2. Delete
https://github.com/Cracert/GIS-icons/blob/master/24x24/layer-delete.png
Destructive operation.
You create a layer, then you delete it.

More detailed description you can find in this article:
https://ojs.cvut.cz/ojs/index.php/gi/article/view/2737

Best regards,
Robert

Thank you Robert!

Interesting to read that pdf as well. However it doesn't contain 
"traffic sign" icons, which are the ones I found mostly in QGIS.

So in short:

- Non-destructive removal (hide)
x Destructive removal (delete)
ø QGIS removal?

Kind regards,
Raymond

Hi,
QGIS 3.10.2 on Windows 10
Using several different raster functions I suddenly can´t get the result because GDAL are directing to Documents.
My Documents are on a server

So I get this error message:


'\\a00143.science.domain\dlt265\Documents'
CMD.EXE was started with the above path as the current directory.
UNC paths are not supported. Defaulting to Windows directory.

Tried to find a place to change the settings for GDAL functions - any suggestions ?

Dear Devs,

This is a report for the QGIS grant proposal to create a documentation bot.
This bot is now alive and automatically create an issue in the
documentation repo for merged PR.

** How to use it **

1) Create a PR on qgis/QGIS
2) tag it with "Needs Documentation"
3) optionally set the milestone to it
4) merge it

=> an issue is automatically created in the qgis/QGIS-Documentation
repository
=> you get a message telling you should take care of it

Example:
dummy PR: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/33627
created issue: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/4744

I have left some notes next to the action, explaining how it works
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.github/workflows/pr_to_doc_issue.md

Thanks to the community and QGIS.org for sponsoring this feature.

Best wishes,
Denis

Hi Denis,

Thanks this sounds much better than the previous solution.

Was the older bot deactivated? The one that creates tickets by commit with
the need-docs tag?

This means devs should no longer add the need-docs tag in individual
commits?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Really cool - great work. This should make things much easier to manage!

Hi all,

Thanks Denis for the work.
I might be missing some key points because comparing the generated reports
from the two systems, I'm sorry I feel like it's instead a regression. Alow
me to explain:

1. For the same feature merged in the code, see old system report [0] vs
new system's [1]. From a doc writer perspective, I get more information
from the first one than the second.

2. Another point is that milestone is what we use to filter issues reports
and manage the docs schedule, so if it's not set by the developer (assuming
that the dev knows the milestone to indicate), someone has to do it
manually in the generated report. With the current system, when we enter a
new development cycle, we (Richard and myself) set the new milestone (for
LTR) and the target version label [2] and then, every generated report is
automatically filled with these information at their creation. Done once
and nobody cares about anymore. Until the next release.
This new system means devs "should" enter that information for each
doc-related PR. I can't count the number of times I made a remind for the
[needs-docs] label, and the PR was merged without...

3. What is meant by "developers should take care of it"? When/where will
the details of the feature be available? If the dev wants to write about
his changes in our docs, OK. Otherwise, are we not overloading their
workload while they could have provided the necessary bits in the commit
message, as they should be doing currently.
What I understood from the proposal is that developers will be encouraged
to detail their feature in the PR message, the place they sell their
feature to others, using a simple and accessible language. And then, at the
merge time, the message of the PR (with maybe screenshots) will be copied
to the generated report in docs, allowing writers to see what the feature
is. Did I misunderstand or have the options changed meanwhile?

Sorry if I'm less joyful than others (I'm not comfortable to comment a work
I could not be able to do, and in English - so sorry if some words/tone
seem used inappropriately) but from a doc repository manager pov, I'm
envisioning more work and less information than we wished. For both writers
and devs. and I wish I'm wrong.
For developers, what does it make easier to you? Nyall, I find your
features very easy and pleasant to document given that  doc related changes
are clearly separated and fully described for writers (see eg [3] which
generate [4][5][6] ) so I'm a bit lost reading your comment above. What
would this improve for you? Btw I wonder what/how this PR in [3] would have
generated as issue report(s) in the doc repository with the new system?

What would this improve for you? Btw I wonder what/how this PR in [3] would have generated as issue report(s) in the doc repository with the new system?

I guess I'm most excited about the future possibilities here ;) I love
that new message which the PR submitter gets pinged on to direct their
attention to the new documentation ticket, and the not-so-subtle
request it makes for them to aid with their feature's documentation.
I'm sure we'd all agree that the more we can encourage/force the
original developers to work WITH the documentation team the better the
whole system will work for everyone. I really like that anyone can go
and add the label to someone else's PR without having to nag/remind
them to add the message to their commits.

I was also under the impression that the whole PR description would
also be lifted across to the new documentation issue, and I can
clearly see that the new text is a regression in terms of making a
readable ticket.

My "ideal" setup would looks something like what we have now, but with:

- copy the whole PR message and images across to the new ticket
- also copy the content of any [needs-docs] tagged commits from the PR
- have a modified version of the stale bot running on the
documentation issues queue, which keeps hassling the PR submitter
every xx weeks until the corresponding documentation ticket is closed.
("Hey, you still haven't added the required documentation for your
.... feature. This isn't playing nice with the QGIS community --
please rectify this ASAP!")
- (my personal #1) as well as opening the documentation ticket, we
also automatically populate the changelog with the text and images
from the PR description.

No, not yet. I wouldn't know where to deactivate it neither have access to

Following the next discussion from Nyall, this could be complementary.

Hi Harrissou,

No worries, I have been more focused on technical matters up to now, but I
was indeed expecting some room for improvements. There was a bit of a
stress to provide reports for the grant proposal, but it was clearly a call
for discussion, sorry not to state it clearly.

I see. So following Nyall's suggestion:
1. Copy description
2. Copy commit message of commits having [needs-doc] (similarly to now)

I see.
So, you take the assumption that any request for documentation happens in
the current release and not in the past.
I guess it might make sense and that it would still be possible to handle
manually the case.
I will see if I can do some nice grepping of the CMakeLists (or as Matthias
suggested max(release-x_y)+2 ) to calculate labels and milestone.

I will update the message explaining how the bot works and that the PR
author should document in the description.
And there, if you have any improvement to make as text changes feel free to
go ahead.

So this would mean setting the author of the PR as assignee of the issue on
the doc repo?
And then a stale bot on this?

It shouldn't be a big deal I guess.
I believe there is already a bot which does something for [FEATURE] commits
right?
This is out of scope, but depending on time left I could potentially do it.

Another thing we could do is writing a message as soon as the PR gets the
tag "Nees Documentation" to tell the author to update the description (and
not wait for it to be merged).

Personally I'm a big -1 for this. I remember how some of my PRs to the docs
repository which followed code changes were not accepted without any valid
reasons (formatting ok, docs build passed on the CI). Instead a lengthly
discussions was initiated about docs in general and not about PR or
its contents.

IMHO until we make a documentation process more friendly for developers such
bot will only turn people away from contributing new features and docs.

Hi

Thanks a lot for this Denis. Having the technical base system for this 
set up is a good step forward!

The biggest advantage of this itself is the direct *link from the 
documentation issue to the pull request* (instead of a commit message as 
previously).

I think instead of trying to push the developer to directly work on the 
documentation (which is something that not everyone in the documentation 
team is stoked about either) is to push them towards writing a nice pull 
request message which - in the best case - can be copied (and rst'ified) 
by someone from the documentation team. In the worst case it needs 
rewriting but at least the documentation team has a place (the pull 
request) to hassle the dev for more information.


My proposals for the two comments are something like

Pull request (after merge):

 > Because this pull request has been tagged as needs documentation, a 
new [issue has been opened](linktoissue). Please make sure that the 
documentation team has enough information by updating the description of 
this pull request with readable and understandable content, supported by 
images and screenshots where appropriate. Thank you for making 
documenting this as easy as possible and for working with the 
documentation team.


Issue (on docs side):

 > A [pull request which requires documentation](linktopr) has been 
merged. Refer to the description in the pull request. If you have open 
questions, do not hesitate to ask them to @author-of-pr.


The original description can be copied to the doc issue or not, I'm not 
sure what's better (keeping it only in the PR has the advantage that 
it's in a single place and if modified after merge we don't have two 
different copies).


About the target version / milestones. If Richard and Harissou already 
up to now kept a mapping of master -> milestone up to date, we could 
consider to keep this going. Having a simple mapping of "target branch" 
to "doc milestone" (e.g. master -> 3.12, release-3_10 -> 3.10, ...) 
somewhere sounds not too convoluted. Or maybe Jürgens release scripts 
could do that even in an automated way.


In the end, this process has to work for the documentation team, please 
take these ideas with a grain of salt. In my opinion we want to have 1) 
a good draft by the dev and 2) a communication channel for documentors. 
Let us know what works best for you, documentation team and to what 
degree you want devs to be involved with actual writing.


Hope this helps and best regards

Matthias

Hi Alexander,

Unless you have examples of how unfriendly the documentation process *IS*
for developers, I ask you to stop these personal attacks. This is the
second time in a month you raise this comment to justify why you no longer
contribute to docs. If you cannot or do not want, it's up to you. Please
assume and stop pointing fingers on others.
Here are your pull requests list [0] and only a single one has ever been
closed by yourself, because (quoting yourself) "*better to keep things as
it until some general agreement found*". Is that bad to want to reach an
agreement or have a plan before proceeding on big changes? Is it not what
is done through QEP or when you build a base class before adding stuff here
and there? What github thread does not directly say in this case is that
your PR targeting 3.0 was opened at a time master was still targeting 2.18
and the big discussion at the moment was whether/how it was possible to
handle 3.x features that were being developed and continue to work on the
long issues queue for 2.18.
So please, don't provide partial, biased and offending information.

If you really think the documentation process is unfriendly, I think
explaining what is not welcoming and help us find how to fix them would be
helpful than ignoring us when you are requested for clarification on
features[1]

Please Matthias, no, not you. You are among the devs regularly
writing/answering to docs in recent years. Do you really think there are
people in the docs team that are against developers working on the
documentation repository?

I personally share your desire. I've complained about the lack of bridges
between developers and writers so I'm not going to spit on efforts that
would improve the situation...
About the degree of involvement of developers in actual writing, as long as
I know, QGIS is a community driven project. Meaning that if I want, I can
contribute to code, to docs, to website, to discussion, to everything...
Why would there be a restriction for some people because they are "tagged"
developers? I think everyone should be allowed to submit the changes he
feels is improving the documentation, either through PRs to docs,
description to code PRs or answering questions... As I said earlier, if the
developers feels comfortable in writing about their changes, please do. The
only thing is that the same way there are rules in contributing to QGIS
repo, there are some in QGIS-Documentation and we need to deal with them.
But why should these be a barrier to not write?
That said, I'm *not* the documentation team (*what is the documentation
team actually?*) and it seems there are various opinions on this topic so
let's hear others.

Hope this helps and best regards

It does.

Harrissou

Hi all, the governance page on our website has a fairly outdated code
maintainer list

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blob/master/source/site/getinvolved/governance/governance.rst#code-maintainers

Could all code maintainers head there and update it? you can assign me
your pull requests.

or, do we maybe not need that list anymore?

Cheers

Hi Marco,
thanks for the review. I'm not sure people still feel responsible for a
specific area of code. If we are unable to enforce, even mildly, this,
IMHO better get rid of the list.
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Does QGIS utilize the statistics of cloud
	optimized GeoTIFF?
Message-ID: <3b8418eab494496aae2219e82eb9a568@C119S212VM042.msvyvi.vaha.local>

Hi,

QGIS is setting the default contrast stretch reasonably If I read a GeoTIFF file from a local file. Statistics are included in the image through the GDAL tags
Tag 42112: <GDALMetadata>
  <Item name="STATISTICS_MAXIMUM" sample="0">0</Item>
  <Item name="STATISTICS_MEAN" sample="0">-10.126687384969</Item>
  <Item name="STATISTICS_MINIMUM" sample="0">-71.313484191895</Item>
  <Item name="STATISTICS_STDDEV" sample="0">9.6992444829123</Item>
  <Item name="STATISTICS_VALID_PERCENT" sample="0">11.53</Item>
</GDALMetadata>

However, if I open the same file through http the image opens with an estimated range between -12153 and 909.  Forcing QGIS to read the whole raster for finding the proper data range with the symbology settings is very slow. Does QGIS even try to find the existing statistics when image is  opened or is something going wrong with this URL:
http://latuviitta.kapsi.fi/data/jarvi_dem/saimaa_dem.tif?

Dear Raymond,

It is hard sometimes to follow fuzzy rules, especially in such large 
projects like QGIS, with so many contributors.
I am not the author of 'traffic sign' icons group, and cannot easily 
define the associated metaphor.

Perhaps we should review the current state of overall toolbar icons 
consistency and try to improve it somehow.
Thank you for paying attention.

regards,
Robert

Thanks Rudi,

@community: Some info: issues.qgis.org == 'qgis3' the old Hetzner server
running our old issue tracker: Redmine, on Debian 8.10...

We kept it in the air so people could eventually lookup old issues
there, and on the frontpage there was a link to our current github issue
tracker: https://github.com/qgis/qgis/issues

Apparently the Redmine/Ruby process crashes.
Anybody willing to try to put it online again?
Or should we just pull the plug (and not pay for it anymore)?
And point issues.qgis.org to our current issue page?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] core API to fetch query output fields from SQL
	query?
Message-ID: <20200109113219.GC1407@liz>

Hi all,
some of you might know already I've been working on improving the
DBManager SQL Window so so not rely on "psycopg2" when interacting
with PostgreSQL backend. This work is in progress in this PR:

  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/33225

The advice, from Alessandro, was to use the new core API for this:

  https://qgis.org/api/classQgsAbstractDatabaseProviderConnection.html

Using that API does give a more stable interaction (automatic
reconnect on connection loss) but has a lack of features currently
used by SQLWindow, which are:

  1. Extracting names of fields returned by a query
  2. Chunk retrival of results (useful for large result sets)

Alessandro proposed to use QgsVectorLayer to solve the first issue:

  https://qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorLayer.html

but I did not find a way to create a QgsDataSourceURI for a generic query
(when a Geometry field might not even exist).

Can anyone help with doing this ?
Or, have another suggestion as to how to solve both issues ?

Thanks in advance.

To me it just looked like it was hanging.  Restarted.

Hi Folks (cc QGIS Developer List, anyone else interested in contributing to
this please let us know).

I think we (Saber, Peter, Nyall, Samweli and myself) have all chatted
barring Anita about
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/161 and the
related https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/128

Anita I am including you in the conversation since you have invested a lot
of energy and time [sic] into time management with your plugin. We are
hoping we can build something that time manager hooks into (short term) and
ultimately replaces time manager with core functionality (longer term).

We have some time zone issues, but I am wondering if we could have a little
1 hour hang out session some time next week to plan and collude? Anita I
think you might have the most issues with timings so how about you suggest
a time and day if you are able to join (bearing in mind Nyall being in
Australia) and the rest of us can see if we can make that work?

Thanks all, look forward to chatting soon!

Regards

Tim

Hi,

Good to hear that work on the time integration is advancing!

The best time next week for me would be Friday morning, for example 09:00
Vienna time / 19:00 Melbourne time (
https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?day=17&month=1&year=2020&p1=259&p2=152&iv=0
).
A bit earlier or later is also possible. I just have a different call
scheduled for 10:00 already.

Anita

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] too many database connections when using QgsTask
Message-ID: <3103FD3DAF34834080694E703C026D1E2C6EF20E@SVEXMB02.intra.swm.de>

Hi all,

we want to load a qlr-file (QgsLayerDefinition.loadLayerDefinition)in the background using the QgsTask Class.

The loading time of the qlr-file is about 50 seconds due to the high number of layers.
During the loading time a dialog box with user feedback should appear.
The goal is to ensure that QGIS does not freeze, but simply does not respond to user clicks.

Now we have noticed that many (about 80) database connections are opened. These are only
closed when you exit QGIS even though the QgsTask is already finished.

Does anyone have any idea why there are so many database connections opened?
Is there a way to reduce the number of Database connections?
Is there a completely different approach to avoid freezing the UI?

Thanks for your help!

Kind regards.

Anja Rademacher

Message-ID: <1e5fb3f2-e598-4452-be62-23a05656d956@opengis.ch>

Hi,

I was trying to download some files from the osgeo4w repository, where I 
get roughly 200 KB/s. From other places I easily get 5 MB/s through my 
current connection.

I tested the following (randomly chosen) 150MB file:

http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/x86_64/release/qgis/qgis-pdb/qgis-pdb-3.8.3-1.tar.bz2

Mainly I wonder if

- we could speed up our azure builds where installation of the qgis 
build deps takes a reasonable amount of time

- we could improve the installation time for people testing nightlies


- Is this a local issue or is this everywhere like this?

- Are there mirrors in place for these download servers?

- Is there a CDN in place?


It would be nice if this could be easily improved (if it's actually a 
problem and not just here)

Best regards

Matthias

Hi Sandro,

This works for me:


vl = QgsVectorLayer( "dbname=qgis_tests host=localhost port=5432
key='__rid__' user=ale table=\"(SELECT row_number() OVER () AS __rid__, *
FROM (SELECT * FROM raster_columns) AS foo)\" schema=public", 'layer',
'postgres')

for fld in vl.fields():
    print(fld)


this is basically how DB manager creates "query" layers, note that the
above example does not have any geometry column.

Also, the vector API uses an iterator, so chunk retrieval is definitely
possible.


Btw, I would be in favor of adding missing methods to the abstract API, as
long as they are not provider-specifics and they can be abstracted from the
DB backend, a capability flag can be added to know if a provider supports
that feature or if it doesn't.

In particular, me an Nyall have been chatting about adding a method to
factory a QgsVectorLayer from a generic SQL query, the issues I see is that
we need a PK (at least for PG) and how to decide the geometry column if
there are more than one.

Having this method would allow us to replace all the Python code that
generates query layers from the provider-specific part of DB manager (the
connectors).

In any event, I was planning to apply for another grant in order to
continue the development of the abstract API, this is what I believe must
be done:

There is still a large amount of work to be done in order to complete all
the desired refactoring and to remove all the Python and C++ code that will
be ultimately be made redundant.

In particular, future work should be undertaken to:
- port all remaining data providers to the new API
refactor and eliminate the remaining DB-manager connectors to make use of
the abstract API
- eliminate duplicate and untested code inside the Processing framework for
working with Postgres databases and port the code to the new, stable,
well-tested API
- refactor and eliminate the remaining QGIS browser data items to make use
of the abstract API

Hope this helps.

I wonder if you could just transparently add row_number[1] to the query to
give each row a unique id?

Be careful with this -- if you're loading layers in a background
thread, you've gotta take extra caution that they are correctly pushed
(using moveToThread) to the main thread FROM the background thread
(can't be "pulled" by the main thread from the background thread).
You've also got to take care that you're not touching the QgsProject
instance or any of the layer tree code from the background thread. And
definitely don't do ANY gui related logic on the background thread.
Violating any of these will directly lead to crashes.

Likely because the dataprovider still has thread affinity with a
thread which has been destroyed. See above.

Between 18:00 and 19:30 AEST is not an option for me --  that's crazy
hour with the family! The couple of hours either side of this is fine
though.

Hi Tim,

the example query I pasted in my original email does exactly that:  (SELECT
row_number()....

we just need a bit of login to determine when/if we have to make that trick.

Ok, I've taken this path [1]. My mistake was using .setDataSource, which
insists in taking a geometry column name.

Of course, as expected, doing the QgsVectorLayer dance degrades
startup costs as very many vector layers will be created, and there's
a number of operations that are done by the PostgreSQL provider when
creating such layers (such as retrieving capabilities of the provider).

Uhm, this would be interesting, does the chunk retrieval depend on 
key generated by "row_number" as well ? The only downsides I see with
using this approach would be:

  1. The cost of creating a QgsVectorLayer
  2. The need to provide a syntetic primary key
  3. (not sure about this): the need to support non-SELECT statements

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Snap cache improvements grant report
Message-ID: <87sgknwqo4.fsf@julien-laptop.home>


Hi PSC, devs, 

Here is my report for the Snap cache improvements grant proposal. 

We write a blog article to better explain what Snap cache improvement was about: https://oslandia.com/en/2020/01/10/en-qgis-snapping-improvements/ 

This work leads to these PRs : 
- Manage circular dependencies: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30947
- Parallelize and relax snap index building: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31648
- Fix QgsTaskManager waitForFinished : https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/32838

The first one is available in 3.10 release while the other ones are only in master. At first, I wanted to backport them in 3.10 but I change my mind. Indeed some of the modifications are quite critical (In QgsTaskManager for instance) and are difficult to fine test (because it's all threads and synchronisation). 

We're going to invest more time and keep working on this in the days to come in order to improve stability and maybe efficiency. 

As a consequence, parallel snap cache building and relaxed mode will
land in 3.12 release. 

Thanks QGIS.org for funding this, 

Regards,
Julien

Hi all,
this service:
https://wms.cartografia.agenziaentrate.gov.it/inspire/wms/ows01.php
is displayed correctly (epsg:6706) in qgis 3.4 (GDAL/OGR 2.4.3 + PROJ
6.2.1) whereas is wrong in 3.10 (GDAL/OGR 3.0.2 + PROJ 6.3.0) on my
Debian box. Reports from Windows are apparently mixed.
Anyone has a hint?
Thanks in advance.

Hi Paolo,

I'm running QGIS 3.11-Master on Ubuntu and I'm able to add layers from
that service in EPSG:6706. What is happening in your QGIS?

Regards,

Jorge

Thanks fro checking. In my case, qgis 3.10 is reprojecting wrong,
placing the layer in Erithrea, rather than in Italy.
Cheers.

more info: layers are displayed correctly also in qgis 3.10 when loaded
as 3046, not as 6706. I suspect there is a real issue with projections here.
cheers.

Hi Paolo,

Maybe related with axis order in 1.3.0? Seems like that. Erithrea
coordinates are like the ones in Italy, but in reverse order.

Jorge

I tried changing that, in connection params, but the result is the same.
loading in 3046 is OK

Greetings everyone,

I wanted to know what was the best way to test memory usage and execution
time.

I would guess that debugging c++ would be one way to check for runtime but
I wanted to know a good way to test for both.

Thanks and have a nice day!

It's hosted in the US - so I'd think it's not the quickest for Europe.

There are other mirrors listed in http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/mirrors.lst
and offered by the installer.

qgis-pdb-3.8.3-1.tar.bz2 is outdated BTW and not hosted on the mirrors anymore.

For qgis-pdb-3.10.0-3.tar.bz2 I get ~7.50 MB/s from norBIT (Hetzner, Germany),
~7.92 MB/s from oslandia (France), ~4.48 MB/s from ftp OSUOSL (US) and ~1.26 MB
from download.osgeo.org (also hosted be OSUOSL) from here.

Ah. I always thought these would offer additional packages not 
distributed via the main osgeo mirror.

If they are simple mirrors it would be good adding a redirector, that 
automatically routes download requests to a fast mirror. But I must 
admit that this is out of my comfort zone.

Another idea would be to use an existing CDN. KeyCDN apparently offers 
free CDN accounts for open source projects. If there is interest I could 
get in touch with them and ask https://www.keycdn.com/open-source-cdn .

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Gentle reminder: PRs opened this week aren't
	gauranteed inclusion in 3.12
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgQ04Sx977bLxJM008Pyw23C7VDKCBZh2oLaLd_GesDyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've heard rumours of some large PRs which are planned to be opened this
week, so I thought I'd send a gentle reminder to all to avoid any
misunderstandings:

if you open a PR this week, even though IF it's opened before freeze, it
does NOT guarantee that it will be included in 3.12

There's a limited number of volunteers available for PR reviewing and PR
reviewing (even for seemingly trivial or minor changes) can take many hours
for a single PR. I know that personally I've a very busy week ahead, and
will have limited time available to dedicate to this task*. If you open a
10000 line PR this week, there's absolutely no guarantee that these
volunteer core committer reviewers will have any chance to review your work
and get it merged before freeze.

(* The same applies for already opened PRs -- just having a PR opened in
any state of readiness does not mean it's automatically eligible for
inclusion in 3.12).

If you've critical work which MUST land in 3.12, open your PRs ASAP, make
sure they are in shape ASAP (no failing tests, new unit tests in place),
and provide as much assistance to the volunteer review team as possible.
And if it's life-or-death HAS to be in 3.12, consider approaching a core
reviewer and offering to sponsor their time for reviewing your work.

Nyall

(* I hope it goes without saying, but volunteer PR reviewers being busy
doesn't give **anyone's** work a short-cut into the master codebase without
proper reviews, regardless of who submits the work, their history with the
project, or the organisation behind the work! )

To conclude this thread: the issue was determined to be a faulty

thanks Even. I imagined it was due to inverted xy axes, but:
* I was surprised that adding the relevant option to the connection
params in qgis did not help
* I was also surprised that in QGIS 3.4 it worked flawlessly.
fun fact: this service is part of an official multimillion service of
the Tax Office.
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS API (PyQGIS) doesn't properly read layers
Message-ID: <3b750a67-71b0-b930-bb2b-4cfdf3c13eec@gmail.com>

I have a problem with reading qgs file by PyQGIS lib. I'm creating 
python standalone stript which externally use PyQGIS from installed QGIS 
desktop application. *The problem is that PyQGIS sometimes read qgs file 
but WITHOUT READING LAYERS INSIDE*. I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, django, 
python 3.6.9, QGIS 3.4.14-Madeira

PyQGIS helps me with reading and updating .qgs files. I'm always using 
same start and ending code.

|fromqgis.core importQgsProject,QgsApplicationapp 
=QgsApplication([],False)app.initQgis()app.exit()project 
=QgsProject.instance()project.read("/path/to/file.qgs")(PyQGISoperations)project.write()app.exit()|

And... the problem is that this code works fine... but never know how 
long, sometimes few days or few weeks but finally comes the moment when 
this code stops working properly. It still reads .qgs file but without 
layers inside, see groups but not layers. It should be impossible that 
code works fine for long time but some day it stops.

PyQGIS unfortunately works that way. The only thing comes to my mind is 
that the problem may be inside qgis desktop because PyQGIS is not common 
library. I belongs and works only with qgis desktop. This program maybe 
remember reading states or use multithreading with the way which i don't 
understand.

Of course, the problem may be completely different but i really don't 
have any more ideas how to change this code.

*Does anyone know how to fix it?*

Some logs from app which makes me wonder, maybe this will help.

|WARNING:QApplicationwas notcreated inthe main()thread.Loadinga file 
that was saved withan older version of qgis (saved 
in3.4.13-Madeira,loaded in3.4.14-Madeira).Problemsmay

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS died on signal -1/11
Message-ID: <CAMvXvBgS+dpQd8kbupuxZC0ofAy3YaVU0EQkSNTkxVduaS+5iA@mail.gmail.com>

Best QGIS Developers,

I seem to have some kind of trouble using QGIS...
The script for QGIS is done and works fine, the problem is that after a
little while of using the program on the Chromebook it stops working, at
first it works great, its fast, responsive and all plugins that we need are
working correctly. but then after a random amount of uses QGIS Desktop
won't start anymore (i don't know why this is happening and it's completely
random when and where the problem starts (sometimes it does this directly
after installing it and sometimes after 8-10 uses but when it begins with
the error it won't start no matter what you do))

When using the shortcut it infinitely loads until chrome os reaches the
time limit of loading.
When using the terminal i get a whole bunch of stuff but it really comes
down to this:

1. When using:*sudo flatpak run org.qgis.qgis* it quits with error message:
QGIS died on signal -1
2. When i try to use another platform plugin (like "minimal") it doesn't
give much except for the error message: QGIS died on signal 11

I am installing QGIS 3.6 using these commands:
*sudo flatpak -y install org.qgis.qgis*
*sudo flatpak update
--commit=f3e180bb9ddc0cc9fc304e899b7c71405d10db81a8200f3d34dfb6288fec15b9
org.qgis.qgis*

Here is the output when running *sudo flatpak run org.qgis.qgis*

Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be
initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

Available platform plugins are: eglfs, minimal, minimalegl, offscreen, vnc,
wayland-egl, wayland, wayland-xcomposite-egl, wayland-xcomposite-glx, xcb.

And then exited with the message: *QGIS died on signal -1*


When i use another platform plugin (such as minimal) it gives no output
except for the message QGIS died on signal 11 (but that only happens on
some platform plugins, most of them just give the -1 exit)

The original issue i created was on here:
https://github.com/flathub/org.qgis.qgis/issues/44


Could somebody help me figure out how to prevent this from happening?


Thanks in advance,


Greetings,

Misha Opstal

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsRendererPropertiesDialog crashes python
	application with PyQgis
Message-ID: <CAP=188nS+woCbtc3pS9GVwDHZL9TWt3CBc5qvubkBJTgYcMCHQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have an external windows standalone python application that uses pyqgis.
When I display a QgsRendererPropertiesDialog, python crashes
(sometimes) when the user clicks on any color button (screenshot:
http://psr.me/1903oq2). The problem is intermitent and seems to be in
displaying the color dialog. In previous QGis versions I could avoid
this problem by using:

        settings = QgsSettings()
        settings.setValue('qgis/native_color_dialogs', True)

QGis then used another color dialog that did not crash my application.
However, since I updated to QGis 3.8.3 (OSGEO4W) this option no longer
works.

I wrote a very small PyQt5 application (below, at the end) that reproduces
the problem: the color button sometimes crashes the application.

Any thoughts on how to fix this?

Operating system: Windows 10 Home
Python version: 3.7.0 (OSGEO4W)
QGis version: 3.8.3 (OSGEO4W)

Thanks,
Marcelo Metello

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Error due to possible Qgis dependency
Message-ID: <CAD6bNqAQc0h8s2L62qRaZV1=D2U-3gM53TLASSgwTOEtYKTuHw@mail.gmail.com>

To the Qgis developer community,

I am part of a team that develops a standalone software for Windows that
encountered a critical error involving the Qgis software.
The software, called "Hera", is developed in Python and currently uses
PyQgis. The problem is that Hera works on all computers that have Qgis
installed, but only on some computers that don't have Qgist installed.
While trying to install it in a computer that has never had Qgis installed,
a critical error is given when we try to open the now installed program.
The error message displayed is as follows: "Failed to execute script Hera"
(as can be seen in the image, available in the link below). Every
dependency that I could think of that could influence the installation was
previously installed, such as all the possible Microsoft visual studio C++
packages, as listed below:
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2008, 2013, 2015,
2017 and 2019.
To test that the problem was truly due to the lack of some missing Qgis
dependency, we created a machine on the AWS Amazon server and tried to
install the software, as well as the  Microsoft visual studio C++ packages
and the previously mentioned error was given. Only after installing Qgis on
the machine was the Hera program successfully launched. However, after
uninstalling Qgis on the same machine, the Hera program continued to run
successfully, indicating to us that the source of the problem might be
because of some dependency or configuration that Qgis does while
installing.
Since PyQgis does not offer some kind of logging or error message showing
the user whats could possibly be missing, I was wondering if anyone could
offer me some insight into what it might be. I appreciate the help, thank
you.

Hi, it's hard to tell, did you try to run dependency walker on the
installed DLLs ?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Environmental policy
Message-ID: <2f841583-0f79-f025-bfce-625e21521187@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
following the interesting proposal by Andreas, I'm here starting a
discussion about QGIS.ORG environmental policy:

* do we need an explicit environmental policy?
* probably our greatest impact is travel for Developers Meetings
  * do we need in person general meetings, or we can promote more
extensive and structured use of remote connections?
  * if we need it, do we need two meetings per year?
  * do we want to plan our meetings in an optimal location, to minimize
total travel?
  * do we want a combination between the two: smaller local meetings
that reduce travel, coordinated across the globe?
  * do we want to suggest|gently push|require participants to use low
impact transportation?
  * do we want a cap on cost and time difference between transportation
method? e.g. train is to be used when cost or duration are no more than
x times flight cost or duration
* do we want to engage in proactive environmental actions? e.g. donating
to the environmental agencies|NGOs|etc. specific tools to evaluate and
reduce impact? e.g. a QGIS ad hoc grant with a specific budget for it
* do we want additional actions? e.g. low impact (vegan) diet on Dev
Meetings?

I tried to collect options and ideas, please do not take these as my
personal preferences.
Given the wide interest and impact of this theme, I encourage an open
and friendly discussion involving also non PSC members. Please be gentle.
Following this I'll call for a vote on specific items.
Cheers.

Hi Paolo,

Good point! Or many good points actually.

For both the environment and inclusiveness we could think about having a 
more decentralized approach for the contributor meetings. Since most 
developers are living in Europe, meetings are in Europe, which attracts 
more European developers etc. That loop needs a *break*. And of course 
the pollution of traveling is there, especially from attendees living 
far away.

So I was thinking of a 3-day 24/7 hackfest. From several, somehow 
digitally interconnected, places.

Would miss all the hugging though! :'(

Cheers,
Raymond

Hi

I am glad we have so many bunny huggers in our community. The weird thing about in-person meetings is how it dedicates and focusses people’s time and attention which I could never replicate as a remote participant in these kind of event. Maybe my donkey needs feeding or my wife wants me to stop ignoring her if I am sitting at home staring at the screen. If I am there in person, suddenly the donkey gets fed by someone else and my wife seems to not mind that I am ignoring her for a few days. 

https://photos.app.goo.gl/5KgUXSD1QX5om7TSA <https://photos.app.goo.gl/5KgUXSD1QX5om7TSA> <- donkey looking pleased I am not at a hack fest

Something more efficient would be to condense our twice yearly get togethers into once a year, longer meeting. We would in a single swoop half the environmental travel cost from our project and maybe still benefit from that oh-so-important face to face time.

And combining it with the user conference would mean that we can have a two tribes event, with a nice mingling of users and contributors.

I am so glad we are discussing this…

Regards

Tim

Hi Paolo,

thank you for bringing this on.

Here is my very personal opinion:

maybe vegetarian


I know it's just a dream and it won't go anywhere but I would add an item
to the list: prohibit the use of QGIS to the fossil-fuels industry.
It would be a strong message btw.

Interesting idea! Also opens the whole ’should we control our own license’ debate again…..

Hi all,

>From a unfortunately long time not attending to hackfests participant I am
also in favour to reduce to once a year - and the idea of combining it with
user meetings is nice as well.
The Licence "issue" - to be honest they would use it anyway .. but as a
message it would be ok (but that would reduce "opensource" to just "source"
too for me).

Personally I see train tickets a lot more expensive than flight tickets and
I think that should change - otherwise I would prefer a train journey
anyway.

Hope to see you all again sometime.

regards
Werner

Hi,

I am also adding my personal preferences down here, but I fear this 
whole discussion will be a bit difficult to summarize.

not sure we really need one. But maybe add a section somewhere on the 
website, just 1-2 paragraphs/sentences should be enough.

yes - and the downloads of QGIS and our server infrastructure. But 
Hetzner already uses green energy (no fossil, no nuclear).

I think the in person meetings are still useful.

Not sure - but something to discuss. Maybe we could have one 
international meeting per year and then another local one organized by 
country user groups or several user groups together.

That would be ideal - but maybe not so easy to achieve. We need 
volunteers. Often we do not have a choice but have to be lucky to find a 
volunteer to organize a meeting.

>    * do we want a combination between the two: smaller local meetings

maybe, or one international meeting per year, and one more local one to 
complement that - see above?

> impact transportation?

How about: gently push. And have the policy that we only reimburse train 
tickets for short distances (to be defined what a short distance means).

But this only for travels that are reimbursed by QGIS.ORG. If the 
participant pay everything by himself, then we can only suggest a travel 
mode.

We don't want a lot of bureaucracy or a "travel police" ;-) we should 
trust on common sense and the good will of our participants. I think 
most QGIS people are environmentally sensitive anyway.

No. Definitely no donations from our donations. That's not the purpose 
of QGIS.ORG.

> * do we want additional actions? e.g. low impact (vegan) diet on Dev
> Meetings?

Only recommend local meeting organizers to also have a focus on our 
environmental impacts. What that means is often best known by the locals.

Thanks for picking up this discussion,

Andreas

I don't understand this. The question was (sorry if unclear):
should we only reimburse train travel, whathever the cost and the
duration, or this should be done until a certain difference?
e.g. (numbers made up)
train 10 h, 100 € | flight 8 h, 80 € > train
train 20 h, 300 € | flight 23 h, 50 € > flight

again, I was probably unclear. the purpose of QGIS.ORG is certainly to
provide the best GIS tools to everyone. as a direct contribution towards
a more sustainable planet we could donate tools especially useful to
plan and reduce impacts.

Cheers.

On cdash.  I suppose it was yesterdays:

There's also a link to cdash above the quoted log.

Dear Kind Colleagues,
...may I suggest to add GLOBAL PEACE & WAR issues to this QGIS
discussion on environmental questions ?

Arguably, ArcGIS was part-created and promoted by the U.S. military,
industry etc.
and recent drone applications all rely on GIS work either way.
Any public development on 'mapping' will directly affect those subjects
(see here for instance for an example of hidden double-development
https://www.icarus.mpg.de/en ).

One cannot separate out those topics from the environment and
sustainability, or a better lifestyle.

And yes,
 most people spend rather their times with bunnies and donkeys than with
tigers and predators  (try it out for yourself if in doubt).

Kindly from Alaska
   Falk Huettmann

PS A typical example how this all is connected,  and for the role of GIS
sits in the Himalaya where glacier mapping and river maps relate
to food security (rice) and warfare, e.g. Afghanistan. Entire drug wars are
relying on such a 'recci'.
Other examples are found with submarines etc.

That's not a good idea IHMO. Don't mix licensing & ethics. Free software 
licenses explicitly don't discriminate against fields of endehavor (see clause 
6 of https://opensource.org/osd-annotated ), and adding discrimination is 
currently generally considered as being a bad idea and likely not enforcable 
in most juridictions, although they are debates around attempts at having 
ethical open source licensing
(https://medium.com/@gmcgath/the-futility-of-the-hippocratic-license-b6a9ad981dec).

Things can get really complex. For example, regarding prohibiting the use to 
the fossil-fuels industry, what about car makers: should they be considered as 
being part of the fossil-fuel industry, and thus prohibited from using the 
software and thus using proprietary mapping solution instead, etc etc. (Open 
Source) licensing is (or is perceived to be) a sufficiently complex topic 
already to not complicate it further.

Personal note: my contributions to FOSS4G related software all started because 
I was able to use them in the context of working in the defense industry in my 
past life: is it about peace or war ? both, depending from the point of view.

I should also remind, that for good or worse, the EPSG database that is 
critical to proper CRS management in our software is mostly maintained by 
IOGP.

The world is complex.

Hi,

Yes, I'd also like to focus on the original issue:

QGIS.ORG should only fund train tickets for short distance travels to 
QGIS contributor meetings (and come up with a definition what "short 
distance" means).

The other discussions about restricting usage of QGIS is a "can of 
worms". The world is not black and white and some substantial amount of 
FOSSGIS software originated from military backgrounds.

2 cents and 2 minor points:

  * One country's freedom fighters is another country's terrorists.
  * The EPSG in the CRS code is an acronym for "European *Petroleum*
    Survey Group"

Don't mix personal moral/ethics with licensing

Upfront: Thank you Andreas and Paolo for kick-starting this
discussion. From the viewpoint of a resident of one of the countries
currently most affected by climate change, yet with one of the most
backward, short-sighted governments imaginable -- it's clearly NOT
going to be our governing bodies which will lead the war on climate
change. In my view it IS the responsibility of smaller groups like
QGIS to do whatever we possibly can to mitigate the change.

> * do we need an explicit environmental policy?

Why not? We do have some power here, in that we provide a desirable,
mature, well respected product. The QGIS project adopting an explicit
environmental policy (in whatever form that takes) does give a good
message to other projects and even to our users that this is a serious
issue.

Here's a point I'm stuck on. I strongly believe that these in-person
meetings are crucial for QGIS, and have gone a long way to promote the
growth, friendliness, and welcoming nature of the community. Removing
them **would** harm the QGIS project. It's been a number of years now
since I've been able to attend one in person, and I'm feeling the
disconnect from the community as a result.

I REALLY want to attend the Nodebo meetup/conference later this year,
but at the same time I'm consciously aware of how bad the impact of
the flight from Australia to Europe is (and there's zero alternative
options available for this). I'm honestly not sure what the right
choice for me to do is here...

Hi,

1) I don't think QGIS.ORG was created to educate people. QGIS.ORG is
doing the job quite well and doesn't have to follow the latest fashion
trends.

2) If QGIS.ORG starts to educate people about environmental issues, the
next step will be about ethical, moral, gender, religion, etc, as we saw
in some emails. Should QGIS.ORG prevent alcoholic drinks (like beer) in
the events? Or unhealthy practices, like smoking or programming for a
couple of hours without regular intervals?

3) QGIS.ORG should follow the open source values and support the ones
that contribute to the project and should care about overall QGIS ecosystem.

3) Each of us have to decide if train is better, car sharing, walking,
etc, according to our own lives. Some might have young children, a sick
spouse or elder parents and prefer the plane instead of train.

4) QGIS.ORG should simple welcome and support the developers asking for
support. QGIS.ORG didn't ask about gender, religion, or anything else
before. So, I don't think we should start asking about eating habits and
so on. We will end up asking about the civil registration of the birth
of children or the spouse's medical record to be eligible for a plane
refund.

In summary, each of us needs his own "environmental policy". QGIS.ORG
doesn't have to have one.

See you soon in 's-Hertogenbosch!

Hi all,
this is turning out a very interesting discussion, that shows the
variety and richness of the approaches within our community.
Please keep on voicing your opinions, so we can have a broader
perspective before reaching a decision, hopefully shared by everyone.
I'm sure many others have interesting things to say.
Cheers.

Hello, Alessandro and Qgis developer community.

Thank you for the feedback, Alessandro. I tried running a dependency walker
on the program and, although it pointed out some possible error related to
Qgis, I couldn't identify why this happened. As can be shown from the error
lines below, the error appears to be related to the path to some python
modules, however having checked, the paths appear correct. Do you have any
insight into what could be causing this, and if this might be the reason
for the error in launching the program?
The link below contains a zip file with the logs, one without Qgis
installed, and one with Qgis. I appreciate the help. Thank you.

Possible Qgis related errors found in Dependency Walker:
LoadLibraryExW("c:\psr\hera\qgis\_gui.pyd", 0x0000000000000000,
LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH) returned NULL. Error: The specified module
could not be found (126).
LoadLibraryExW("c:\psr\hera\qgis\_core.pyd", 0x0000000000000000,
LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH) returned NULL. Error: The specified module
could not be found (126).

Message-ID: <CAJ6DwMDEeCgeJ4NcfUhk_zzXdQ+Mg+Zn3nm5PGLzeU06nErbow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I created the following code:

class FBSegmentPoiComboBox(FBComboBox):
    def __init__(self, name, identifier=None, update_method=None, iface=None):
        super().__init__(name=name, identifier=identifier,
update_method=update_method)
        self.iface = iface
        self.items_list = []
        self.find_segments()
        self.rubber_band = QgsRubberBand(self.iface.mapCanvas(), False)
        self.rubber_band.setWidth(12)
        self.rubber_band.setStrokeColor(QColor.fromRgb(90, 0, 20))
        self.highlighted.connect(self.highlight_segment)
        self.currentIndexChanged.connect(self.clear_rubberband)

    def find_segments(self):
        self.clear()
        self.add_item(REFRESH_SEGMENTS_LIST, None)
        # put a dummy at position 0
        self.items_list = ['dummy']
        segment_layer_list = QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName('segment')
        if segment_layer_list:
            segment_layer = segment_layer_list[0]
            layer =
QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot().findLayer(segment_layer)
            if layer:
                layer.setItemVisibilityChecked(True)
            if self.iface:
                segments = QgsSpatialIndex()
                for segment in segment_layer.getFeatures():
                    segments.insertFeature(segment)
                nearby =
segments.nearestNeighbor(self.iface.mapCanvas().center(),
neighbors=10) # , maxDistance=1000)
                for featureId in nearby:
                    fit2 =
segment_layer.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFid(featureId))
                    ftr = QgsFeature()
                    fit2.nextFeature(ftr)
                    self.add_item(ftr.attribute(0), ftr.attribute(0))
                    self.items_list.append(ftr)
        self.changed = False

    def highlight_segment(self, index):
        self.rubber_band.reset()
        if index == 0:
            self.find_segments()
        elif index < len(self.items_list):
            self.rubber_band.setToGeometry(self.items_list[index].geometry())

    def clear_rubberband(self, index):
        self.rubber_band.reset()


It populates a drop down with all the LineStrings near to the center
of the screen.

It's not very efficient though, as I need to first pass all the
LineStrings on that particular layer to it.

Is there a way to replace this code:

                for segment in segment_layer.getFeatures():
                    segments.insertFeature(segment)

So it only works on a smaller subset of features that are actually
visible to on the user's screen?

Hi Jo,

You can use setFilterRect (see
https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/vector.html).

request = QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterRect(iface.mapCanvas().extent())
for feature in layer.getFeatures(request):
	print(feature.id)

This way, you only iterate over the visible features.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Processing,
	Model Designer and ETL Campaign crowdfund launched!
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgJhhQ386WuhhnWHp+WnYycfdO8cX6xs-r+59i_0GdVLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

North Road are pleased to announce our latest crowdfunding campaign
for QGIS. This time, we're focusing on further expanding the
capabilities and flexibility of Processing and the Processing Model
Designer, and expanding on QGIS' offerings as an ETL tool!

QGIS Processing offers a rich and expandable set of algorithms which
can operate on spatial data, along with a powerful Model Designer
which allows users to string together these algorithms to create
custom workflows.

Since its introduction in QGIS 2, the Processing framework has seen an
intensive amount of development and optimisation efforts. In recent
QGIS releases it offers a very user-friendly way of performing complex
spatial data processing tasks, all without requiring ANY expensive
third-party tools or software licenses!

Unlike a typical crowdfunding campaign, where a specific funding
target and deadline is set, we’re running this campaign a little
differently. Instead, this campaign is taking the form of a “à la
carte” menu of Processing enhancements. These range from small
“paper-cut” style fixes, through to larger architectural improvements,
and are each individually priced accordingly. We are asking backers to
pick individual enhancements from this “menu of enhancements” and fund
that enhancement’s development in full. In order to make this campaign
affordable for a wide range of backers, we’ve included a huge range of
enhancements which vary in price from smaller amounts to larger
amounts.

You can read the full details of the campaign and browse the list of
proposed enhancements at the campaign page:

Dear hackers, developers and contributors! :)

Having attended quite some hackfests in the past, I never expected to 
reach the maximum of 50 attendees for the next hackfest. But having 
already 35 subscriptions by now and knowing quite some people who are 
still considering to come, we are starting to worry a bit.

So the good news is that we will be many. The bad news is that people 
might not be welcome, or might need to work in some additional location 
(which would be lame, cause why traveling so far and not sit together?).

For now, please:
- subscribe if you want to be in
- add your arrival and departure datetimes to the list, so we know per 
day how many people will be present
- book hotels
- in case you unfortunately change your plans, remove yourself from the 
list to make space for somebody else

Thank you so much and hope to see you all soon!

Raymond

Hi all,

I would just like to say I am totally in favor of having an environmental
policy which would just state that we are acting and considering
environmental issues in our work.

I am totally supporting the idea of promoting the train for reachable
places and try to avoid too disconnected places.
It might be very difficult to come up with a strict formula, and I would
say it makes more sense to evaluate this per meeting?
Also, the idea of 1 longer meeting makes sense, since that's the easiest
way to reduce the moves. Promoting secondary and/or simultaneous events in
other places (by sponsoring them too) would be nice too.

I also believe that personal meetups are essential to our community, maybe
because the beer or any non-alcoholic beverage doesn't go through fiber
channels.

That makes me jump to my last point: I don't see that bringing an
environmental policy is an open door to ethical or political matters.
Mainly because they are totally different things: environmental issues are
scientific facts while ethics or politics are tight to human cultures and
beliefs.

Things are moving fast lately, and we'll be / we are being judged by our
children, and....promoting the train is the very least we can do.
People are still free to to do whatever they prefer. I guess for now (half
kidding, half serious).

Anyway, thanks Andreas for raising this discussion and shaking us. And PSC
for making the discussion continue.

Best wishes,
Denis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] What to do with WMS Server Search
Message-ID: <CALuHMPD3_rNekGnh2Nr3dyeTtCvKORYCifU2EvmkaNz6z37gTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

while checking open issues I have found one about WMS Server Search
functionality https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/25660.

It is about Server search tab in the "Add WMS/WMTS layer" dialog. This
search tab uses configurable catalog URL which by default is set to Sourcepole's
server. According to Pirmin, this catalog didn't get many updates since years.
Also we now have a MetaSearch plugin which is our "new" way to search
for OGC services.

What we should do with WMS Server Search? In the ticket there are two options
proposed:

1. remove WMS Server Search completely and put a hint suggesting user
to use MetaSearch plugin
2. remove default catalog URL from the QGIS settings and show WMS Server
Search tab only when user have entered an URL

Thoughts?

I know there's been a lot of inter-project cooperation to fix
projection-related bugs lately, and that the point release was delayed to
coordinate QGIS, GDAL, and PROJ patches.

 

What GDAL and PROJ versions *should* one have with the normal-stream 3.10.2
release (i.e. not 3.4.X LTR nor weekly 3.11 build)?

 

I installed 3.10.2 (OSGeo4W installer) over the weekend, and I'm running
into a bunch of issues (zoom crashes -
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/33902; corrupted output from
georeferencer, custom CRS that has lost its USER:xxxxx label). Before I try
to pick them off one by one, is it possible the right dependencies didn't
make it into the install?

 

My About. screen says I have GDAL 3.0.2 and PROJ "6.2.1 dated Nov 1", which
makes me suspicious.

 

Thanks, Martin

Hi all,

The QGIS 3.10.2 splash is showing LTR! :)

[image: Splash_3102.jpg]
It seems that all the commits from Jan 17, after the Release of 3.10.2
commit, was used in OSGeo4W compilation

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commits/release-3_10

QGIS version 3.10.2-A Coruña
QGIS code revision 8e4fe02b4a

Something to care?

Best regards,
Pedro

Dear Colleagues,

thanks;

three things, if I may add them here. I think they do matter:

-train-location events sound great, but have no good global meaning. Most
continents cannot be reached by or from trains (think planes, ships or
others).
 One way or another, you need to think global, and where most users sit
(outside of the EU ?). I would think without U.S., China, Africa, Latin
America or India QGIS has no good future. And how about Aussi and New
Zealand ?
 So I propose cyber sessions instead.

-same applies to the definition and use of GIS: it's global now and must
include all aspects, warfare and environmental atmospheric issues (that
includes IPCC for instance).
 Feel free to think about 'space NASA' issues too.

-Overall, QGIS now grew big, but it then faces truly global issues. It's
better to tackle them and be aware.
Otherwise, QGIS will go down and be replaced (see what happened to SPANS,
SAGA or GRASS earlier, and watch GIS in R for that matter, or python)

One way forward here would be to acknowledge those issues and start with a
holistic and effective vision statement including those things above.
Then you can try to tackle them on more individual sections, but not losing
the wider context.

Those would be my 3 cents on the issue; hope it helps.

Very best

      Falk Huettmann

Can we please remove the 3.10.2 installer from the website as a matter
of urgency? This installer was released using the older gdal 3.0.2 and
proj 6.2 versions, which directly lead to crashes and reprojection
failures in QGIS.

QGIS ********************SHOULD NEVER EVER*********************** be
used with gdal >= 3 and gdal < 3.0.3 or proj >6 and proj < 6.3.0.

This combination is a world of hurt for users :(

Tickets filed at https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/618, and
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/617, and later today I'm going
to commit cmake blocks which will completely prevent compilation under
the affected gdal/proj versions.

Hi all,

Thanks to all people involved in getting us out of this nightmare!

Just for notice, I just installed 3.10.2 with Osgeo4W and I got gdal 3.0.2
with proj 6.2.1...which is bad if I read correctly the above.

Best wishes,
Denis

I prefer option 1,and removing the Server search -  it is a long time ago that I looked at it, but IIRC it is not using any OGC standard for the search right?

+1 to remove Server Search (and thanks to Sourcepole for supporting it
for so long) and point to MetaSearch's default CSW list.  If we want a
dedicated CSW, perhaps we can consider the geopole.org CSW server as
a default endpoint in MetaSearch of sorts.  Or stand up a QGIS community
CSW like https://csw.qgis.org dedicated to QGIS itself.

Note that with the evolving OGC API efforts MetaSearch will be upgraded
to support the next generation OGC API - Records (read new CSW), and
will be able to leverage both current and future OGC APIs.

Having said this, a key issue is maintenance and freshness of content
(harvesting, scraping resources, etc.).

To: qgis-developer <qgis-developer at lists.osgeo.org>


Can we please remove the 3.10.2 installer from the website as a matter
of urgency? This installer was released using the older gdal 3.0.2 and
proj 6.2 versions, which directly lead to crashes and reprojection
failures in QGIS.

QGIS ********************SHOULD NEVER EVER*********************** be
used with gdal >= 3 and gdal < 3.0.3 or proj >6 and proj < 6.3.0.

This combination is a world of hurt for users :(

Tickets filed at https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/618, and
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/617, and later today I'm going
to commit cmake blocks which will completely prevent compilation under
the affected gdal/proj versions.

+100 on all that's been said here.

Also, once 3.10.2 is updated to include the updated packages &
above-referred fix, I'd suggest writing a QGIS.org blog post to inform
users of the worthiness of updating to 3.10.2(.2) *ASAP*, and expand a bit
on why 3.10.0/.1 were such rough releases. We can finish the post by
thanking users that have reported bugs (an inevitable nightmare to go
through as QGIS was exposing brand new GDAL3/PROJ6 versions to the masses).
IMHO, we should not skip this communication to our users.

Hi all.
I also agree. I'd think twice before setting up an ad hoc service. As you mention, maintaining it will be a challenge.
Cheers.

Hi there  
  
I like the idea of having an environmental policy which state that we are considering environmental issues as well.  
  
Likewise I support Andreas' original input, that QGIS.ORG should only fund train tickets for short distance travels to QGIS contributor meetings.  
I think it's not about educating people in their lifestyle, it's about "not supporting financially" things. Everyone will still be free to travel self-payed by plane and nobody should be blamed for doing it (like QGIS.ORG doesn't blame anyone for smoking, but doesn't pay the cigarettes either).  
In case that someone has a difficult situation like e.g. sick spouse and cannot afford the plane travel by him-/herself, maybe exceptions for individual cases can be made.  
  
Other topics depend on where the meeting takes place. In universities, it's probably easy to offer vegan food only. In e.g. Madeira where we went out eating, it depends on what's offered by the restaurants.  
  
I have no strong opinion yet regarding the amount of meetings etc. but providing good possibilities to participate on the meeting via remote makes sense anyway for all who cannot be there for whatever reason.  
  
Thanks and cheers  
Dave

Hi all,

One more note to add to Raymond's announcement:

s-Hertogenbosch is a lovely Dutch town - but hotels can be pricey and 
the choices are somewhat limited. :(

So it is safer to arrange your hotel bookings early on.

I just did a quick sweep online - it looks fine for now ;) but you know...



Hope to see you soon!

@Tim, sad to hear. See you at another time!

Aron

Hi List,
Hopefully I can offer some insights into this as someone with some 
experience in spatial service discovery (I run GeoSeer: 
https:/www.geoseer.net - a search engine for spatial web services).

-----
csw.geopole.org is what I believe is behind the search button. As it 
stands right now, this service has the following stats for *working* WMS 
services:
* Points to 229 services that have data
* Across 63 hosts
* with 3,938 layers
It has 0 working WMTS, WFS, or WCS entries.

That might seem like a lot, but GeoSeer's index has the following:
* 218,861 services
* across 5,000 hosts
* with 2,048,346 datasets/layers
More stats: https://www.geoseer.net/stats/ - The index is regularly 
refreshed.

So basically the Geopole service has less than 0.1% of the OGC services 
that are out there (GeoSeer's index isn't exhaustive, but it is several 
times larger than the next largest I know of).

---

Just to be clear, I'm not trying to sleight the GeoPole service, instead 
I'm highlighting a problem that is rarely considered: Manually searching 
CSW's/data portals is almost pointless.

Basically, there are at least 391 CSW services out there (325 of which 
work). Is it reasonable to expect users to be able to find them all and 
manually search them, even with a plugin?
And even if a user did search them all, between them, all those 325 
working CSW's only have about 5% of the spatial web services that are 
actually out there and working! You're still missing 95% of them!

This is why the solutions suggested here while good in theory don't 
really work. At best they're a placebo.

Co-incidentally, I did a blog post on this exact thing just a few days 
ago - https://www.geoseer.net/blog/?p=2020-01-10_dataportal_problems

----

Solution?
You're welcome to point users to GeoSeer's free web search - it's 
completely free and there are no adverts (because ethics).

GeoSeer also has an API which is designed for exactly this sort of thing 
- https://www.geoseer.net/api.php - it lets you integrate the search 
directly in the application. It's not free because that's how GeoSeer 
covers its costs. I have considered creating a GeoSeer plugin for QGIS 
that uses the API but the business case hasn't been there yet.

I'm open to questions if you want more stats, or have any thoughts/comments.
Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi

Do you know the WIP bot?

It blocks merging pull requests with WIP in the title. It's very helpful 
to tag pull requests as requiring action and add an extra obstacle 
before clicking the green merge button.

I think we can only win by installing it.

Could a repository admin do that for me?

Thank you very much

Matthias

Yes, I have used it before but I think the WIP bot goes further.

- IIRC tests are not executed for draft PRs

- I think I cannot make a pull request a draft once its opened (and I 
realize only 10 minutes after opening that I needed to verify X or add 
some tests)

Not anymore. Tests are running on a draft PR now. I think it was only at
the beginning.

Yes, this is missing, I agree.

Hi,

I find it very useful but sometimes it return false positives:

https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/640060885#L897

is there anything we can do to fix it?

I knew about "spellok",  but it shouldn't be necessary (because it wastes
time): can we avoid the spellcheck to check the lines of code in the first
place?

Paolo, here's the draft blog post:

*Public Service Announcement: Update to the latest point release now*
------
QGIS users who have adopted the 3.10 version when initially released at the
end of October 2019 have likely noticed a sharp drop in reliability. The
underlying issues have now been addressed in 3.10.2, all users are advised
to update *now*.

When QGIS 3.10 was first released in the end of October 2019, a pair of
libraries – namely GDAL and PROJ – were updated to their next-generation
versions. The advantages are plenty: GeoPDF export[1] support, more
accurate coordinate transformation, etc. For those interested, more
technical information on this is available here[2].

The update of these crucial libraries led to a number of regressions. While
we expected some issues to arise, the seriousness of the disruption caught
us off guard. Yet, it was also somewhat inevitable: QGIS is the first large
GIS project to expose these next-generation libraries to the masses. The
large number of QGIS users across the globe were essentially stress testing
both new code within QGIS as well as the libraries themselves.

Thanks to dedicated users taking time to file in report and the community
helping out as well as our project sponsors for allowing us to fund
development time, developers have been able to fix all known regressions in
both in QGIS as well as underlying GDAL and PROJ libraries, benefiting a
large number of open source projects.

As a result of this collective effort by the community, QGIS 3.10.2 is now
back to being the reliable and stable GIS software we all love. As such, we
cannot stress enough the important of updating now.

Once again, thanks to our community of testers, sponsors, and developers
for their countless hours and efforts in making QGIS better.

Happy mapping!

Hi Mathieu,

Thanks a lot. It reads very well!

Something that I'd like to add is that in case of still finding a bug, 
users should file issues and to mention proximity of LTR replacement.

If you still happen to find QGIS behaving in an unexpected way, please 
let us know on https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues 
<https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1579773605204000&usg=AFQjCNHP21SO7MPYwrn023vHOeZwMUBKuQ> 
as always. We are very happy that QGIS 3.10 is now in shape to replace 
3.4 as LTR in a month time.

Bests
Matthias

How about

- Waiting for https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/33971

- Releasing 3.10.3

- Announce on twitter, blog, news panel

Clear cut for everyone (including those 95% of our users not following 
[qgis on] twitter)

You made a mistake translating/editing:
„the important of“ ==> „the importance of“

As such, we cannot stress enough the important of updating now.

Betreff: Re: [QGIS-Developer] Fwd: Urgent: Remove windows 3.10.2 installer from site

Paolo, here's the draft blog post:

*Public Service Announcement: Update to the latest point release now*
------
QGIS users who have adopted the 3.10 version when initially released at the end of October 2019 have likely noticed a sharp drop in reliability. The underlying issues have now been addressed in 3.10.2, all users are advised to update *now*.

When QGIS 3.10 was first released in the end of October 2019, a pair of libraries – namely GDAL and PROJ – were updated to their next-generation versions. The advantages are plenty: GeoPDF export[1] support, more accurate coordinate transformation, etc. For those interested, more technical information on this is available here[2].

The update of these crucial libraries led to a number of regressions. While we expected some issues to arise, the seriousness of the disruption caught us off guard. Yet, it was also somewhat inevitable: QGIS is the first large GIS project to expose these next-generation libraries to the masses. The large number of QGIS users across the globe were essentially stress testing both new code within QGIS as well as the libraries themselves.

Thanks to dedicated users taking time to file in report and the community helping out as well as our project sponsors for allowing us to fund development time, developers have been able to fix all known regressions in both in QGIS as well as underlying GDAL and PROJ libraries, benefiting a large number of open source projects.

As a result of this collective effort by the community, QGIS 3.10.2 is now back to being the reliable and stable GIS software we all love. As such, we cannot stress enough the important of updating now.

Once again, thanks to our community of testers, sponsors, and developers for their countless hours and efforts in making QGIS better.

Happy mapping!

Also, once 3.10.2 is updated to include the updated packages & above-referred fix, I'd suggest writing a QGIS.org blog post to inform users of the worthiness of updating to 3.10.2(.2) *ASAP*, and expand a bit on why 3.10.0/.1 were such rough releases. We can finish the post by thanking users that have reported bugs (an inevitable nightmare to go through as QGIS was exposing brand new GDAL3/PROJ6 versions to the masses). IMHO, we should not skip this communication to our users.

Can we please remove the 3.10.2 installer from the website as a matter
of urgency? This installer was released using the older gdal 3.0.2 and
proj 6.2 versions, which directly lead to crashes and reprojection
failures in QGIS.

QGIS ********************SHOULD NEVER EVER*********************** be
used with gdal >= 3 and gdal < 3.0.3 or proj >6 and proj < 6.3.0.

This combination is a world of hurt for users :(

Tickets filed at https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/618, and
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/617, and later today I'm going
to commit cmake blocks which will completely prevent compilation under
the affected gdal/proj versions.

Thank you for proof reading, Stefan!

Please note, however, that the tone of the message (i.e. "Posting that

As our code of conduct [0] states: "Be kind to others. Do not insult or put

Thanks a lot Denis!

But what's the point in checking the spelling of C++ code? It won't build
if a method/class/variable is mispelled.

Isn't that possible to limit the spellcheck to strings (and comments) ?

Hi Alessandro,

Spellcheck also guarantees consistent use of names in public API we 
expose (setColor vs. setColour etc).

Bests

Hello, Alessandro and Qgis developer community.

Thank you for the feedback, Alessandro. I tried running a dependency walker
on the program and, although it pointed out some possible error related to
Qgis, I couldn't identify why this happened. As can be shown from the error
lines below, the error appears to be related to the path to some python
modules, however having checked, the paths appear correct. Do you have any
insight into what could be causing this, and if this might be the reason
for the error in launching the program?
The link below contains a zip file with the logs, one without Qgis
installed, and one with Qgis. I appreciate the help. Thank you.

Possible Qgis related errors found in Dependency Walker:
LoadLibraryExW("c:\psr\hera\qgis\_gui.pyd", 0x0000000000000000,
LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH) returned NULL. Error: The specified module
could not be found (126).
LoadLibraryExW("c:\psr\hera\qgis\_core.pyd", 0x0000000000000000,
LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH) returned NULL. Error: The specified module
could not be found (126).

"Since PyQgis does not offer some kind of logging or error message showing
the user whats could possibly be missing" not true!
try to install qgis-dev and related pdb symbols... set QGIS_DEBUG [1] env
var with some value > 0 (usually 0 to 3) and see the log in the DbgView
windows application

btw in dependecywalker I can see that the two log have error finding qgis
or related qgis libs (the second one)... so seems more a problem setting
the PATH env var where to look for DLLs.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Data provider default values and default value
	clause
Message-ID: <CAL5Q6720rfhnDiQVajFDH3K3YBBh7Q=1GoHRBz7B9y98sESB=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Sorry for the long post, but I need some advice on the current API:

I'm working on a bugfix (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/33383) and (as
sometimes happens) I just opened another can of worms, I'm currently
testing the following providers:
- postgres
- spatialite
- ogr (spatialite opened with ogr provider)

and the following methods (dp is the QgsDataProvider instance):

dp.defaultValue(fieldIndex)
dp.defaultValueClause(fieldIndex)

the behavior of the tested providers is totally different and before
attempting to homogenize them, I'd like to be sure about my understanding
of the expected behavior, the relevant docs are:

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorDataProvider.html#ad2a51ae0b1928a179e258e7eba6d94a7
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorDataProvider.html#a8b8b1fe945ec289885d77f820c85f8b6

Note that in case of a literal default value (like "123", "My default
text") the result of the two function calls in some (but not all) of the
current provider implementation may be the same (except for the returned
type).

Questions:
1. From the docs it seems that the defaultValueClause() should ONLY return
clauses (like sequences, functions, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP etc.) and should NOT
return literal defaults.

2. From the docs it seems that defaultValue() should return ONLY literal
defaults and NOT functions, ::nextval and friends

3. OGR provider does return the actual client-side calculated value when
calling defaultValue() ONLY in case of literal defaults and
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE and CURRENT_TIME, it returns the clause
definition in all other cases, is this correct?

4. postgres provider in case the property EvaluateDefaultValues is true
does something more and send the clause to the server for evaluation,
returning the calculated value, otherwise it returns the clause definition.

5. What to return in case of no defaults? Depending on provider and field
types, some implementations return a NULL (QVariant()), some others return
a Python None.

So, I'm confused about the expected behavior, if the documentation of
defaultValue() and defaultValueClause() is correct then the provider
implementations are (at least for some of them) wrong.

I'd like to hear other developer's opinion before proceeding with a fix for
the a.m. providers.

Thank you in advance!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Estimate metadata when loading a vector layer
Message-ID: <fe68328a1eb1411f87ff03d18e5d46ec@SCPEX2K13-2.scp.fr>

Hi,

After many hours searching the web, I didn't find any solution, so I come to the dev community.

I have an issue when loading a big layer with PostGIS :


-          On QGIS 2.14 it was very fast (~100 ms) using the flag "useEstimatedMetadata" set to True

-          On QGIS 3.4 it is very slow (~1min) using the flag "checkPrimaryKeyUnicity" set to False

o   st_extent(geom) is run to load the layer and takes about 1 min (I wish st_estimated_extent was used)

Any idea please ?
Thanks a lot,

BR

Please file an issue attaching a test project and a DB dump (with a couple
of records to test with, no need for a big dump).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Prefered way of creating custom parameters and
 widgets in Processing
Message-ID: <1579877827842-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

I am porting a Processing algorithm provider plugin from QGIS 2.x to 3.10.
The provider requires some custom parameters and parameter widgets and I am
a bit lost in trying to figure out how to create and register them. I found
some PRs (e.g. https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7761) and QEPs (e.g.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/65) but that just
adds to my confusion because it looks like the discussions and ideas were
evolving quite quickly from having the definitions in ParametersPanel to
Python WidgetWrapper class to C++ wrappers, factories and registries. Also
it looks like there are now two ways of creating the wrappers
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/gui/wrappers.py#L1773-L1797).

Is there an existing algorithm provider which uses the preferred method of
creating custom parameters and their widgets? Or a Python code example or
documentation that I could use as a starting point?
Thanks!
Rado

Has 3.10.2-2 been verified to have solved the projection issues. I have
been holding off introducing it to our departments until it was fixed. I
will also wait for several weeks as well to make sure there isn't some
other serious issue.

Thanks,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to open a QGIS prococessing algorithm dialog
	in python?
Message-ID: <CAJy=XtdAv-8zGStDkByQoaZ2iLO59siFvcSL8aNiLs-7U0QFGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGIS developers,

I would like to programmatically show a processing algoritm dialog from
python. I gived a look to processing toolbox and I found that this is
possible importing and instantiating the class AlgorithmDialog
[gui/processingToolbox.py][1]

    from processing.gui.AlgorithmDialog import AlgorithmDialog
    from qgis.core import QgsApplication

    alg =
QgsApplication.processingRegistry().algorithmById('qgis:extractbyattribute')
    dlg = AlgorithmDialog(alg, False, iface.mainWindow())
    dlg.show()
    dlg.exec_()

This opens algorithm dialog and let me perform processing computations but
once closed the dialog window QGIS become instable and crash without any
message interacting with the user interface.

What am I doing wrong? Is there a method to do this in other way?

I just posted the question on StackExchange:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/348542/open-qgis-prococessing-algorithm-dialog-with-python

Thanks in advance.

It's wise of you not to have your department jump on a .0 release. All
known (ie reported through filing) protection issues have been resolved.

That said, you should also take on the task of stress testing the latest
version against your department's workflows and datasets. Unreported issues
are usually not addressed ;)

It's especially crucial to do this now as we're 4 weeks away from seeing
3.4 being retired in favor of 3.10.

Cheers

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Handling NULL differs in concat vs || in
	expressions: let's remove ||
Message-ID: <85cce235-fa76-64c4-e477-dc46debd2d93@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

tldr; should the '||'-button in QGIS expressions not either behave like
a real 'String concat' function,
or
as a logical OR
or
be removed?   <= my favourite

Longer story:

If you want to play, this zip contains a geopackage and shp and QGIS
project: http://duif.net/concat_issue.zip

I had to create a new column by concatenating 3 strings from other
columns in field calculator (but label expressions behave the same).
I used:

 "col1"   || ' '  || "col2"   || ' '  || "col3"

but all records which had one or more NULL values in (tested both gpkg
and shp) showed nothing (NULL)

So thought to create an issue, but then found:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/16460
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/11504
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/15848
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/18608

Then I thought "if || invalidates the string if it contains a NULL, it
more behaves like an OR and that should be shown in the help text"
BUT: these buttons do not have an help text (only a small label).
Then I searched for a 'concat' function and found it

String/concat: "Concatenates several strings to one. NULL values are
converted to empty strings. Other values (like numbers) are converted to
strings."

So this just works flawlessly:

concat( "col1", ' ',  "col2", ' ',  "col3" )

Should the '||' not be removed from the expression buttons?
As it works (in my opinion) counter intuitive?

Or else the label could be changed? It now says 'String concatenation'.
Which it is not, as it also concatenates integers to strings etc.

The argument that it behaves like sql is also not valid: || is behaving
differently on all kind of database:

Oracle apparently only returns NULL if ALL the arguments are NULL, else
it creates an empty string from the NULL, see
http://www.sqlines.com/oracle-to-sql-server/string_concat

Mysql and SQL server apparently handle this differently too:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39453742/sql-like-with-double-pipe-concatenation

Opinions?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

The argument that it behaves like PostgreSQL is good enough for me.
No need something that is working.

I don't have a strong opinion on the buttons.

Hi Jonathan,
thanks for your thougths. I am in favour of replacing the current 
service with Geoseer.
Objections anyone?
How do you suggest to proceed?
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Qgis crashes while loading WMTS layers
Message-ID: <e608e1cc-ef40-b259-9c67-177ecb1bfa8c@gmail.com>

Good day to all.

Not so long ago I wrote a post about issues handling large numbers of 
raster files. This results from what appears to be an architectural 
design limitation of Qgis in that it only has enough resources available 
for a certain (unknown) number of raster layers and does not have any 
effective system for dealing with the exhaustion of these resources.

I also noted that the software does not appear to have the ability to 
use the swap (virtual memory) resources within a system to deal with the 
apparent exhaustion of resources, as other software would. For example, 
Gimp which I use for graphical editing is able to handle certain 
projects using a swap space of 200 GB, which consists of 32 GB of 
physical RAM and the rest in SSD. It is not unusual with some of these 
graphics projects to have 100 GB or more of swap space in use, without 
crashing the system. (This being possible since Gimp 2.10 with its 
ability to write files of more than 4 GB)

Whilst it is possible to manage the number of layers with file based 
rasters, this cannot be done with a WMTS server because there is no way 
I am aware of to manage the number of layers that can be downloaded from 
the server.

Version 2.18 and earlier almost never crashed with excess layers, 
usually all that would happen is a layer would be displayed with invalid 
data. However, crashes have become the norm with 3.x versions of software.

It seems to me there is a big architectural problem in the software with 
its inability to utilise the full resources of the system in order to 
process the number of layers that a WMTS server is capable of issuing.

Hi Patrick,
I can't comment on the core issue, but just a point for clarification - 
I thought Swap memory usage was something the operating system dealt 
with? Isn't it usually transparent to the application?

A quick search indicates that what GIMP calls swap is really a bespoke 
folder for GIMP to store temporary files (in a fashion similar to 
virtual memory/swap) rather than the system swap file; FME does this too 
(they call it a "temporary directory").

I can certainly see why that would have value - it looks like QGIS has 
one, at least for temporary outputs - 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/28222 - but whether it's as well 
used as it should be I leave for others to comment on (I have no idea 
what it's used for).

Cheers,
Jonathan

Massive -1. Just because something is complex, doesn't make it wrong!

Otherwise by the same reasoning we could make a case that all
single-part geometry types should be removed and we should just treat
everything as multipart, because it would cause less issues! (hint: it
won't :P)

Yep - there's a built in method which does this for you.

You want either

from qgis.processing import createAlgorithmDialog
dlg = createAlgorithmDialog('qgis:extractbyattribute', parameters={})
dlg.exec_()

OR

from qgis.processing import execAlgorithmDialog
results = execAlgorithmDialog('qgis:extractbyattribute', parameters={})

(check the docs for each for the full details)

In general, try to avoid any "from processing.* " imports -- those are
all internal details and not considered stable API. Anything in
"qgis.processing" IS stable and is public API, designed for external
use.

Correct. However -- not all providers are completely well behaved in
this regard. Some of these are because of limitations on the provider
itself, e.g. there is no way to different literal defaults from
clause-type defaults on the associated backend. When we can't
differentiate the two, we err on the side of returning a
possible-literal value from defaultValueClause (and not the reverse
and accidentally return a non-literal value from defaultValue() ).

> 2. From the docs it seems that defaultValue() should return ONLY literal defaults and NOT functions, ::nextval and friends

Correct (and should ALWAYS be the case)

> 3. OGR provider does return the actual client-side calculated value when calling defaultValue() ONLY in case of literal defaults and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE and CURRENT_TIME, it returns the clause definition in all other cases, is this correct?

Yes - it's deliberate, even thought it slightly violates the above
answer to (2) in that for this provider we pre-calculate these
quasi-literal values on the qgis side.

> 4. postgres provider in case the property EvaluateDefaultValues is true does something more and send the clause to the server for evaluation, returning the calculated value, otherwise it returns the clause definition.

That's correct also, and by design. As per the warnings in the
defaultValue() docs, defaultValue calls are potentially dangerous to
make and should only ever be done when creating features (and in that
situation, only ever called once per field per feature). Otherwise
when EvaluateDefaultValues is true we run the risk of evaluating
sequences multiple times for a single feature, causing "gaps" in the
sequence.

> 5. What to return in case of no defaults? Depending on provider and field types, some implementations return a NULL (QVariant()), some others return a Python None.

Slight correction: QVariant() != Python NULL. Rather QVariant() ==
Python None, and QVariant( QVariant::Int ) == Python NULL. The c++ api
doesn't usually differentiate between the two and QVariant() is more
commonly used. (And I personally think in 4.0 we should completely
remove the PyQGIS NULL/QVariant( QVariant::Int ) distinctions -- they
add much complexity to code without compelling enough benefits).

Short answer: return QVariant() when no default literal exists.

> So, I'm confused about the expected behavior, if the documentation of defaultValue() and defaultValueClause() is correct then the provider implementations are (at least for some of them) wrong.

Hope that clarifies!

It's not complex, it is not behaving as most people think it is, or are
familiar with AND there is not 'help' for these buttons (in contrast
with the functions, where you could describe this behaviour).

As said, it was my frustration (as in: instead of just 'using' I ended
up trying and testing) that I "lost" labels just because whole records
were ignorred, because certain columns had NULL values, and I ended up
with an overly complex expression which tested IF the value was NULL.

It's when I thought it was a bug that I found that other people, also
had been there, AND found that there was another 'concat' function
behaving a little different.

In general I prefer a single intuitive working way of doing things, do I
agree that 'intuitive' is very personal :-(

Hi,

After searching into QGIS source code again, I found the option to set a project “trusted”, which bypasses the checks about the extent and other metadata on postgresql.
It’s exactly what I need!

Have a good week,

Hi,

After many hours searching the web, I didn’t find any solution, so I come to the dev community.

I have an issue when loading a big layer with PostGIS :


-          On QGIS 2.14 it was very fast (~100 ms) using the flag “useEstimatedMetadata” set to True

-          On QGIS 3.4 it is very slow (~1min) using the flag “checkPrimaryKeyUnicity” set to False

o   st_extent(geom) is run to load the layer and takes about 1 min (I wish st_estimated_extent was used)

Any idea please ?
Thanks a lot,

Hi Nyall,

thank you for confirming my worst nightmares :)

Unfortunately, since the data providers are certainly a foundation
component of QGIS, these behavior inconsistencies lead to issues in client
code (GUI/UX mainly but probably also in QgsVectorLayerUtils create
features functions) and I believe we should try hard to find a solution.

Do you think it is a wast of time (because as you mentioned some providers
can't tell the difference between a literal and an expression)?

I've done a PR that does not completely fix all the issues but at least
adds some tests and fixes a few things:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/34012

Hi all

This is just to advise you that we will be migrating the plugins.qgis.org <http://plugins.qgis.org/> and planet.qgis.org <http://planet.qgis.org/> web sites to a new server over the next hour or two. We do not expect any downtime of these servers during this migration but we do ask you to hold on uploading any new plugins until I post an update announcement indicating that the new server is online and fully operational.

During this migration, we will be deploying security updates and a platform upgrade to Django 2.x and Python 3 that was performed by Alessandro Pasotti. Dimas Ciptura also migrated the feed platform used for https://planet.qgis.org <https://planet.qgis.org/> to Django 2.x and Python 3. The plugins web site will also be on it’s own dedicated server now which should hopefully improve responsiveness.

If you have any problems using / connecting to these servers, please do not hesitate to contact myself and Dimas (in cc) to let us know.

Thank you 

Regards

Tim

Thanks Even. As I read it, this essentially means we are more or less
forced to use the latest version, not the LTS (or to stick to an older
one). This could mean more bugs.
Any deeper insight?

Message-ID: <BY5PR09MB416861D66AFB5D05DF6740F6AE0B0@BY5PR09MB4168.namprd09.prod.outlook.com>

Hello All,

I've noticed that QGIS 3.10.2-2 (and previous versions) would crash and then get flagged by Trend Micro with the following 2 "Security Threat":

  *   TSC_GENCLEAN https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/TSC_GENCLEAN
  *   Unauthorized File Encryption https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/search/unauthorized%20file%20encryption

I don't know if the crashes are caused by the Trend Micro, but it would be great if I can figure out what QGIS is doing to trigger Trend.  Can anyone tell me how these "Security Threats" are related to how QGIS works?

Thanks,
Bob

It's an unexpected move, but I can honestly understand the rationale behind it.

Here's my analysis of the impact it will have on QGIS (using quotes
from https://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2020-January/038316.html)

> "One is a change in policy regarding the LTS releases, where the LTS part of a release is in the future going to be restricted to commercial customers. All bug fixes will (as agreed on the Qt Contributor Summit) go into dev first. Backporting bug fixes is something that the Qt Company will take care of for these LTS branches. We’ve seen over the past that LTS support is something mainly required by large companies, and should hopefully help us get some more commercial support for developing Qt further."

Doesn't greatly affect us, since this change mainly has distro level
impact. Of our supported platforms, we have:

- linux: Qt releases are a distro responsibility, so no direct impact
to us there. Distros will either need to manually backport fixes from
Qt current releases to older releases, or update more frequently to
newer Qt releases. I can understand this will be painful for distro
level Qt maintainers, but for our users there's likely to be minimal
impact, and possibly we'll see a **better** end user experience IF
distros decide to start updating Qt major releases more frequently.
- mac: Zero impact. The mac builds use infrastructure that regularly
updates to the current Qt versions and don't use LTR releases.
- Windows: Zero impact -- osgeo4w doesn't use Qt LTR releases, and
doesn't regularly update Qt versions. It's done on an ad-hoc basis and
will likely continue this way

On the flip side, if this move increases the revenue stream and
viability of the Qt company, then it's a GOOD thing for us.

> "The second change is that a Qt Account will be in the future required for binary packages. Source code will continue to be available as currently. This will simplify distribution and integration with the Marketplace. In addition, we want open source users to contribute to Qt or the Qt ecosystem. Doing so is only possible with a valid Qt Account (Jira, code review and the forums all require a Qt Account)."

Almost zero impact. A bit of annoyance for the handful of QGIS
developers who build QGIS using custom (non distro) Qt versions or who
use upstream Qt Creator releases, but likely all those already have Qt
Accounts for use on the Qt bug tracker.

> "The third change is that The Qt Company will in the future also offer a lower priced product for small businesses. That small business product is btw not limited to mobile like the one Digia had some years ago, but covers all of Qt for Device Creation."

Zero impact.

Lastly, from https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-offering-changes-2020 :

> "The offline installer will become available to commercial licensees only"

This is the biggest impact. I understand that osgeo4w qt libraries are
based off the offline installer packages (correct me if I'm wrong here
Jürgen!). The consequence of this is that we'd need to self-build Qt
libraries for inclusion in osgeo4w and the QGIS installers. Outcome:
more work for the Windows installer maintainers̶.

Well - I realise it's nitpicking, but I don't see this as a bug,
rather as a feature request. Before the default value/ default value
clause api was introduced we had NO way of differentiating these two,
for any providers. We'd treat everything as a clause and there was
lots of bugs as a result. When it was introduced the majority of
providers were updated to utilise it, with the expectation of those
which **couldn't** (due to backend limitations). For those providers
there was no regressions -- they just didn't get the improved
handling/user experience that the other providers gained. It's
technically a "feature request" to somehow upgrade the remainder and
find ways to differentiate default clauses from literal values for
those providers.

There may well be implementation bugs here (there always is!), but I
think the existing API is fine and gives a sufficient level of
distinction between the two.

> Do you think it is a wast of time (because as you mentioned some providers can't tell the difference between a literal and an expression)?

...Possibly? When I added them I did look into these backends with no
luck, but you may have better luck then I did! (or just run into the
same dead-ends...)

QGIS sources aren't bound to a particular QT version. Currently the requirement is just >= 5.9
So pretty much depends on what binary distributions actually ship.

I've tried to follow the discussion on the thread announcing it at
https://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2020-January/thread.html#38316
but it is still unclear if QT Company will publish the source of their LTS branches or not.
At the very least, bugfixes that apply to the latest -dev branch, and older branches,
will be available, so people can *potentially* backport them (pending extra burden for
FOSS QT, typically Linux ones, distribution maintainers to scrutanize what must be
backported, which according to [1] would be very hard to do). If they don't publish the
source of the LTS branches, and a bug only affects a LTS branch and not the latest -dev branch, then
non-commercial customers will not benefit from it.

A lot of speculations in the above thoughts, and from a outsider of the working of the QT
project. If QT Company has the ultimate say to which branches are maintained or not,
or if other companies might jump in to bring back public LTS support...

Anyway, somewhat related to the above considerations, it looks like as far as OSGeo4W is
concerned, there's a QT 5.11.3 release with security fixes (cf [2]) whereas 5.11.2 is shipped now.
But as the 5.11 branch is no maintained anymore, it is
well possible that 5.11.3 contains know issues, including security related ones,
fixed in later versions.
The 5.12 series is (should we say "was" now ?) announced as the LTS one with support until
5.12.2021 according to [3], so could be (have been?) a good candidate to track.
Perhaps some upgrade policy should be defined (only makes sense if there's manpower to
implement it of course)

This question should be addressed to Trend Micro, to explain what it is
they are flagging, and why it is a legitimate complaint.  Software like
Trend Micro is almost always proprietary and opaque, so people other
than the company simply cannot answer questions like the one you are
asking.  I would not be surprised if it is some pattern-matching false
positive.

I can confirm, over the years we have had a number of these false
positives with various anivirus etc.
Usually customer complains with the provider helped solve the issue.
If you do, please report back, it will be appreciated.

I tried to avoid the building because that takes ages - and we maybe have other
advantages by using the "standard" binaries.

I originally thought that we could also upgrade the compiler with the update,
but the compiler we were already using was the last the installer offered 32
and 64bit builds - at the time - so I kept using that.

qtwebkit had to be built extra anyway - which is also huge (maybe even larger
than Qt itself) and later I found that qtwebengine wasn't builtin as well,
which is also a huge build.

So I'm not sure that using the installer instead of building myself saved much
at all.  IIRC webkit used to be the most time consuming part of the build in
earlier versions.

Another side note: azure pipelines will phase out the image carrying the 2015
compiler we use in march - not sure if we can install 2015 on the fly, that was
what didn't work in github workflows (producing an internal compiler error at
some point)…

BTW which is the version that has the fixes we contracted KDAB on?

I didn't know exactly, but from Mathieu's 
<https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2019-December/059735.html> 
and Kristian's messages here 
<https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2019-December/059740.html> 
on this list, I deduce that it should be at least PROJ 6.3 and from 
Even's message 
<https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2019-December/059748.html> 
that GDAL/OGR should be at least 3.0.3 .

Currently, *PROJ 6.3.0* is the latest released version of PROJ 
<https://proj.org/download.html#current-release> (as announced in 
Kristian's message, it was released on 2020-01-01) and *GDAL/OGR 3.0.3* 
(released on 2020-01-08) is currently the latest released version of 
GDAL <https://gdal.org/download.html#current-releases>.

Thus, the only viable released versions available are:

  * PROJ 6.3.0
  * GDAL/OGR 3.0.3

On the master branch, these minimal versions are also enforced by the 
build system thanks to PR 34038 
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/34038>. This changes came after the 
3.10.2 release, though, so aren't included in the source for that release.

For convenience and visibility, I think it'd be great if the blog post 
"Public Service Announcement: Update to the latest point release now" 
<http://blog.qgis.org/2020/01/24/public-service-announcement-update-to-the-latest-point-release-now/> 
would be edited to also include these two lib version numbers.

Kind regards,
Raphael

Apparently, the first Windows builds of release 3.10.2 still included 
older versions of GDAL/OGR and PROJ. See this thread 
<https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2020-January/thread.html#59948> 
on this list. 
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2020-January/060001.html 
seems to indicate that 3.10.2 was re-released some time before 
2020-01-23 16:16 PST (2020-01-24 00:16 UTC). So *if you downloaded QGIS 
3.10.2 before that, you should re-download it* to not suffer from the 
bugs of the old library versions.

I don't know why the 3.10.2 was re-released instead of releasing 3.10.3 
with the upgraded library versions as suggested in that mailing list 
thread (here 
<https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2020-January/059983.html> 
and here 
<https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2020-January/059986.html>). 
Releasing it as 3.10.3 would have made it more clear to users, which 
version they actually downloaded and would have been more in line with 
semantic versioning concepts. (I dunno whether QGIS aims to follow 
semantic versioning conventions.)

Kind regards,
Raphael

For what it's worth, I agree with Richard that it's often not what's 
expected. And the worst is that on first sight it looks as if it's 
working as expected.

Having the button for the unexpected more prominent than the function 
someone was looking for is not the most helpful thing.

In courses I always teach people to stay away from `||` unless they 
really know what they are doing.

I'm in favor of removal of the quick access button too.

The functionality of `||` on the other hand should be left untouched. 
(it's useful to have e.g. `prefix || filename` produce NULL if filename 
is NULL)

Thank you for the follow-up, Raphael.

I'm now up to date and all works for me.

 

My original message was just before the mad scramble to re-release 3.10.x
with 3.0.3 and 6.3.0 (and in fact may together with the associated bug
reports have prompted it). 

 

My appreciation to the developers for the quick followup (doubtless
displacing whatever Nyall et al meant to be doing last week..), and for
doing their best to maintain a complex and very capable geospatial software
ecosystem. Not easy, in the open-source or commercial software environments.

 

I think there are lessons to be learnt about what should trigger (and, on
the flip side, be allowed in) _._._-x, _._.x, and _.x releases. In
particular, given the criticality I suspect it would have been better to
withdraw 3.10.2 and issue the fix as 3.10.3. And (earlier) to not try to
backport the Proj4->Proj6 shift into QGIS 3.4.x at all. (And maybe to not
change custom projection functionality as much between 3.10.1 and 3.10.2,
waiting until 3.12.) But I realize we were scrambling to fix the darn thing
rather than splitting hairs on versioning, and I think we can wait for the
devs' PTSD symptoms to abate somewhat before conclusive postmortems!

 

Thanks again,

Martin

Full +1 with Matthias (and others).
Partial +1 with Richard; you're right that it's unexpected at first. We
should make sure it's explained in help, and if space permits some clue in
the tooltip wouldn't hurt.

But I think for better or worse lots of users (those that use expressions,
that is...) will have developed code in their projects that harnesses the
nuances of ||, concat, and coalesce around NULL in specific ways. I'd be
very careful about changing or getting rid of || since it will break stuff.

No opinion on the buttons.

I can totally feel you there, for myself I've the same issue when I fly
for work or yes (let's be honest at times also for leisure)

Something I've started doing already 5 years ago is _at least_ to carbon
offset all my flights through myclimate.org. I know it is not the
solution but it can't hurt. I'm considering now to offset my (and
OPENGIS.ch) total foot print

Cheers

Marco

Thanks Even for a very nice write-up of a complex matter, even-though I
see Alessandro's point, I'm absolutely with you that we should not mix
our ethics with our licenses.

With OPENGIS.ch we have refused to do some work offers because we didn't
feel confident that it was about Peace, but that is an assessment that
each individual has to do himself since as you say it depends on the
viewpoint.

Hello!

We find that the union processing tool fails with certain geometries. The
error shown is "GEOS geoprocessing error: difference failed.". The check
validity tool did not find any errors with the input layer.

The input data used can be downloaded here:
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/41bwzjpid3ahwxo/isochrone%20issue.7z?dl=0

Is it related to this issue: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/21584  ?

Thanks for your support,

Nevil

Message-ID: <CABPxTTq7PYjhqFoHJVQKD8-UO0VGGBzkt0mD-RZgtV_7+MZ1kA@mail.gmail.com>

I can get a list of all of the authentication IDs in QGIS by these two
lines of code.

authMgr = QgsApplication.authManager()
authIdList = authMgr.configIds()

Starting from one of the authentication ids in the list I cannot seem to
find out how to retrieve its associated name. It is probably simple, but I
cannot find the right method to call. Does anyone know how to do it?

Thanks,

Calvin

Further investigation and comment

Since recently installing Qgis 3.4.15 or 3.4.14 on some of my computers 
running Debian 10, I immediately began to see a trend of the software 
exhibiting an increased tendency to crash when working with certain WMTS 
layers that I had previously worked with extensively over recent weeks 
for mapping purposes.

After attempting numerous changes including special versions of projects 
containing no file based raster layers and only containing one WMTS 
layer at a time and being unable to use the software regardless I 
created a virtual machine running Debian 9 which has the latest version 
available for that platform, 3.4.4. This has resulted in immediate major 
improvement in the reliability of the software to the point I can resume 
using it without the numerous crashes of the software that have been 
noted recently, especially in the last week approximately.
