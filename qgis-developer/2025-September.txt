Status update: we've now moved ALL of testing CI to Qt 6! ? All tests
which were passing on qt 5 are now passing on qt 6, and a handful of
underlying issues which were breaking these remaining tests have been fixed.

HI Nyall,

Thank you for the status update and your work!

Question: do you still prefer the skipping of one release and then release
of QGIS 4.0 in February 2026? Just to be clear on this.

Thank you for your reply,
Andreas

I agree with Nyalls position on this.  No point rushing it out esp
considering the API changes and plugins etc and more testing time.

So 4.0 in february and  4.2 in june.

So 3.44 would continue to 3.44.7 and 3.40 to 3.40.23.

Hi all,
I think it could be useful - if possible - to add QGIS 3.46 (from .0 to 
.3) to the roadmap (instead of extending QGIS 3.44 from .4 to .7).

Having a QGIS 3.46 version would allow users to use (and extensively 
test) the new features added only to the master branch in the latest months.

In this case, I guess https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/63049 should be 
reverted and merged again in master right after the release of QGIS 3.46 
in October.

Regards.

Andrea

master is already at 3.99 (ie. below the next release - to allow people to
upgrade to the release they were testing before - which a 3.46 would break).

They could(/are supposed to do) that with the master nightlies.

Message-ID: <CAMtsY+bDvxu=ef_8WRuisrBUBSPKjajU01jCPmdtmk0WR7hZDw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

After the discussion of skipping one release before 4.0, I would like to
suggest to turn 3.44 into a LTR version:
- this would lower the pressure on the upcoming 4.0
- this would make a last 3.x version with all the features a LTR
- this would avoid the complexity of maintenance over such a long period of
time on 3.40 (in case 4.0 gets more delayed)

No big deal, but I believe this would make things a bit smoother.

Denis

Hi all,

Tomorrow is our next PSC meeting. We can discuss it there and then announce
it somewhere where it is hopefully visible (feed and or blog) - along with
the information that QGIS 4.0 is postponed to 2026.

I am also +1 to make 3.44 an LTR as the last 3.x version.

Andreas

Hi all!
The Idea of making the last 3.x a LTR is a very good one and I think there
is a big benefit if we do so.

so big +1 from my side too

Werner

Hi all,

Then comes the question of the timing.
Here would be my proposal:

- 3.40 stays LTR until the 4.0 release (if it sticks to the schedule, it's
the regular amount of time)
- 3.44 turns LTR when 4.0 is released, until 4.2 becomes LTR (if we stick
to the schedule, it's again the regular amount of time)

see the modified schedule:

I could not find the 'pyqt5_to_pyqt6.py' script on a QGIS-Qt6-Windows install...

Would it be an idea to add that to the Qt6 Windows packages?
