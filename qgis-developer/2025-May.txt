Hi Nyall,

I wanted to get back to you regarding your proposed changes to the grant 
programme process. The changes make sense for me.

Is 1 week enough for contributor voting & discussion summary writing?

Would you start a dedicated QEP for updating the grant programme process?

Regards,

Anita

Hi Jean,
Thank you for your work and for bringing this up.

We discussed your proposal at the recent PSC meeting. We agreed that while
fixing these Qt6-related unit tests is indeed essential, there?s no need
for a special, separate funding initiative. Instead, we consider this
effort to fall within the scope of the regular bug fixing round (starting
next week), albeit with an extended timeframe and budget allocation given
the scale of the Qt6 transition.

Andreas will note this in the mail to the devs participating in the
bugfixing round.

Cheers Marco

Hello,

Thanks for accepting it! Sadly I'm now out of work for a while. I let 
Julien Cabieces and Florent Fougeres take it from here.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] STAC classes in Python bindings
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+bOM-du2ZN6LOQysH3QbYOEzL+En5nGOABpCST3fyjmNw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

For a refactoring of a plugin using STAC catalog (
https://github.com/piMoll/swissgeodownloader), we are thinking about using
the core implementation. None of these classes are available in Python
bindings and they are marked as private (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/src/core/stac).

Is there any specific reason for this? Do you have any objection to making
this public?

Cheers,
Denis

I recently made a new blog to share tips and tricks for QGIS users. It can be found at https://qgis.tips<https://qgis.tips/>. It is a personal non-profit side project and I don't use the QGIS logo. To make it very clear it's not an official QGIS website I added the text "This not an official QGIS website. This website is made by Michel Stuyts." to the footer of every page of the website. I was notified by Alexandre Neto I should ask permission to use the word "qgis" in the url of my blog. So my question is: is it ok for me to use the domain "qgis.tips" for my blog?

Hi Denis

The core STAC support was a two-part implementation, one in 3.38 and one in
3.40.
We just wanted to avoid the stable API limitation while there was work in
progress.

I believe there's no reason to keep it like this any more :)

Best
Stefanos

Great, thanks a lot for the feedback.
We'll probably make it available and flag it unstable until 4.0 then.

Hi Michel,

FYI, I still have qgis.be available for the Belgian QGIS User Group ;-)
qgis.tips is also cool though :-)

This website is made by Michel Stuyts.? to the footer of every page of the website. I was notified by Alexandre Neto I should ask permission to use the word ?qgis? in the url of my blog. So my question is: is it ok for me to use the domain ?qgis.tips? for my blog?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] locate proj.db used by Qgis from python plugin or
 script
Message-ID: <612188c0-14c4-4535-9953-30b543e8a074@ign.fr>

Dear colleagues,

I have already sent my question on the qgis-user list but someone told me it should be bette to ask on Qgis-dev.

I am working on the plugin IdentifProj (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/IdentifProj/). For the developpement of the plugin I would like to acces to the CRS definition file (proj.db).

Is there a way to locate the proj.db on the system (and precisely the version which is currentely used by qgis) ? I would like to be able to load it from python to get some informations which are not available from QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem class.

Best regards,
Jacques

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Missing fixes in 3.40 branch: commits merged to
 queued_ltr_backports not subsequently merged to release-3_40
Message-ID: <6a7ee973-dd63-41d2-b8e0-b4e1200416b2@libero.it>

Hi all,
I've recently noticed that, for unknown reasons, some commits merged to 
the queued_ltr_backports branch on March have not been subsequently 
merged to the release-3_40 branch leaving the issues not fixed in QGIS 3.40.

Particularly, the PR "Fix regression from57255" 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/61011 by Lo?c Bartoletti was merged to 
master on March 20th and the "[Backport queued_ltr_backports] Fix 
regression from57255" https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/61105 was merged 
on the same day to the queued_ltr_backports branch.

However it looks like the relative commits were not included in the PR 
"Queued LTR backports" https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/61150 by Nyall 
Dawson merged to the release-3_40 branch on March 23th. They are not 
even in the "Queued ltr backports" 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/61574 by Nyall Dawson merged to the 
release-3_40 branch on April 22th.

After a non exhaustive check, it seems to me that also the following 
ones, all merged to the queued_ltr_backports branch on March 20th, have 
not been subsequently merged to the release-3_40 branch:

- "[Backport queued_ltr_backports] [GDAL] Deal with [C]Float16 of GDAL 
3.11 as [C]Float32" https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/61099
  - "[Backport queued_ltr_backports] Add special handling for geocentric 
CRS in QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::toGeographicCrs()" 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/61097
- "[Backport queued_ltr_backports] profile tool: clear the measure tool 
when a new profile is set" https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/61095

I fear that the same issue might have been occurred for other PRs, but I 
don't know how it is possible to find the affected ones without manually 
check one by one.

I hope those 2 moths old fixes could be finally merged to the 
release-3_40 branch in time for the release of QGIS LTR 3.40.7 (which is 
planned for tomorrow).

Best regards.

Andrea

Sorry, that'll be my mess up. The branch syncing is all done manually and
requires some force pushes -- looks like I messed something up along the
way on that round! ?

You've written to the wrong place ;-)   Please follow up with your IT
department about their incorrect blocking.

Or, if they have investigated and are really sure this is true, rather
than the usual random error in blocking schemes, they or you could post
evidence.

Hello,

We are using QGIS to regularly edit shapefiles and raster data stored on SharePoint. However, we've run into an issue: SharePoint paths are user-specific (e.g., C:\Users\[username]...), which breaks shared access across multiple users in QGIS.
We are specifically looking for a way to save files directly on SharePoint, rather than on the local synced copy, which remains tied to a specific user profile.
For info , we are using  3.34.0 version.
Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
