Hi Nyall,

I wanted to get back to you regarding your proposed changes to the grant 
programme process. The changes make sense for me.

Is 1 week enough for contributor voting & discussion summary writing?

Would you start a dedicated QEP for updating the grant programme process?

Regards,

Anita

Hi Jean,
Thank you for your work and for bringing this up.

We discussed your proposal at the recent PSC meeting. We agreed that while
fixing these Qt6-related unit tests is indeed essential, there?s no need
for a special, separate funding initiative. Instead, we consider this
effort to fall within the scope of the regular bug fixing round (starting
next week), albeit with an extended timeframe and budget allocation given
the scale of the Qt6 transition.

Andreas will note this in the mail to the devs participating in the
bugfixing round.

Cheers Marco

Hello,

Thanks for accepting it! Sadly I'm now out of work for a while. I let 
Julien Cabieces and Florent Fougeres take it from here.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] STAC classes in Python bindings
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+bOM-du2ZN6LOQysH3QbYOEzL+En5nGOABpCST3fyjmNw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

For a refactoring of a plugin using STAC catalog (
https://github.com/piMoll/swissgeodownloader), we are thinking about using
the core implementation. None of these classes are available in Python
bindings and they are marked as private (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/src/core/stac).

Is there any specific reason for this? Do you have any objection to making
this public?

Cheers,
Denis

I recently made a new blog to share tips and tricks for QGIS users. It can be found at https://qgis.tips<https://qgis.tips/>. It is a personal non-profit side project and I don't use the QGIS logo. To make it very clear it's not an official QGIS website I added the text "This not an official QGIS website. This website is made by Michel Stuyts." to the footer of every page of the website. I was notified by Alexandre Neto I should ask permission to use the word "qgis" in the url of my blog. So my question is: is it ok for me to use the domain "qgis.tips" for my blog?

Hi Denis

The core STAC support was a two-part implementation, one in 3.38 and one in
3.40.
We just wanted to avoid the stable API limitation while there was work in
progress.

I believe there's no reason to keep it like this any more :)

Best
Stefanos

Great, thanks a lot for the feedback.
We'll probably make it available and flag it unstable until 4.0 then.

Hi Michel,

FYI, I still have qgis.be available for the Belgian QGIS User Group ;-)
qgis.tips is also cool though :-)

It is a personal non-profit side project and I don?t use the QGIS logo. To make it very clear it?s not an official QGIS website I added the text ?This not an official QGIS website. This website is made by Michel Stuyts.? to the footer of every page of the website. I was notified by Alexandre Neto I should ask permission to use the word ?qgis? in the url of my blog. So my question is: is it ok for me to use the domain ?qgis.tips? for my blog?
