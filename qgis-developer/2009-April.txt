Subject: [Qgis-developer] String categories in translations files
Message-ID: <200904011201.48384.borysiasty@aster.pl>

Hi List,
I've just opened linguist and realized that some strings newly added to the 
translation files are a little messed. The strings of fTools are put to a few 
unclearly named categories/contexts scattered among others. The Beata strings 
are put to the categories BeataDialog and BeataDialogGui whereas the old table 
was in the QgsAttributeTable, QgsAttributeTableBase and 
QgsAttributeTableDisplay. In general, most of the categories are named as 
QgsClassName, including QgsClassNameBase for ui files.

What about keeping these rules for all plugins too? I think at least fTools 
shouldn't be scattered as GeometryDialog, VisualDialog etc but rather 
alphabetically gathered as fToolsGeometryDialog, fToolsVisualDialog... (if not 
QgsFtoolsGeometryDialog and QgsFtoolsVisualDialog).

The bad news for Carson is the categories are just the class names, so you would 
have to rename all fTools classes :(( But the advantage is that translators will 
be aware where are the strings from...

My idea is probably best illustrated by the QgsPluginInstaller categories.

Regards,
B.

Good day, guys!
I have a problem with zooming poligonal maps. At some scale QGIS freezes 
with 100% loaded CPU. After 10-15 minutes QGIS refreshing map, but every 
change of scale or extent would freeze QGIS again.
Is this a bug or rendering feature?
Sorry for bad english

Message-ID: <49D35371.70302@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
In qgis from trunk, the option
	update="yes"
in GRASS modules does not seem to be recognized; as a result, the loaded
map does not appear in the menu, and the command is unusable.
I just committed a change to svn, removing the option for r.colors.*
commands. Now commands work properly, but I guess there will be more to
fix. I'll look into this.
Does anyone know why the option stopped working?
All the best.

Peter Ersts may correct me if I am wrong, but at present there is no
work underway on raster analysis in core. During the hackfest we started
with the creation of a new (third) QGIS library libqgis_analysis.
Currently mainly Carson is working on porting his python routines to
this, but it would be great to start wrapping in other raster orientated
routines.

Someone posted to the mailing list not too long ago that they were
planning to wrap gdal raster functions such as clip, warp etc. though I
dont know what state (if any) that work is currently at.

Regards

Tim

Hi all


QGIS 1.0.1 Release Plans:
- ------------------------

Some of you may already have 1.0.1 down as a distant memory, even though
it still hasnt been formally announced yet. This is by design rather
than ommission as I want to have a Windows build all in one installer to
accompany it. One of the major pieces of feedback I got with the 1.0.0
build is that people really missed the all in one standalone installer.

Since several of us now have QGIS building under MSVC, and I have the
nsis packager Marco did working with the MSVC built QGIS, we are on the
home strait to having an all in on installer ready over the next week or
so -  at which point I will put the package online and announce the release.

I will give 1.0.2 a month or so for additional bugfixes to come in (dont
forget to patch your changes into the stable branch where appropriate).

QGIS 1.1 Release Plans:
- ------------------------

I would like to request that we feature freeze one week from today
(Thursday 9 April).

Following that we will have a two week period for stabilisation and
translations with code freeze and creation of 1.1 branch on 23 April.

Following the branch creation, I will put out a call for packaging with
the aim of making release announcements around 4 May 2009.

Please let me know if there are any problems with these timings. I will
be updating the 1.1 release checklist over the weekend and will post a
link then.


Lots of nifty new things to look forward to in 1.1....so take the chance
of this week to get your cool new features in!

Regards

Reading threw several threads it kept coming up and I thought I'd try to
clarify from what I know.

MrSID is free to use, as with many linux distro's it's not part of the
defualt build of say gdal because it's not open source. But it is indeed
free just like acrobat or flash or an of those "non-free" apps.
This is what I understand from listening to MPG who I believe works for
lizardtech (which is an OSGeo sponsor).

Maybe we can offer up a 2nd build via launchpad for the "non-free"
version of gdal build with support turned on.

Hi,

we were discussing it (Prague hackfest) with Martin Dobias and Martin
Landa this week. In Prague, there would be Geoinformatics
seminar/conference around the time [1]. 

It would be nice, to organize Prague hackfest around this date, means autumn
(every year). 

Otherwise, since non-developer,

Hi Alex,

Thanks for clarification.

I had a look at the LizardTech webpage
(http://www.lizardtech.com/download/) and couldn't find a source code
release to download and compile for gdal support. Would I have to download
a SDK (requires registration first?)

Does it also properly support 64bit Linux?

The problem with many of those free/but closed source apps is that they
usually only support mainstream platforms (usually 32 bit Intel Linux) -
they wouldn't support PowerPC/ARM, 64 bit/AMD Linux support. For the same
reason I don't like Flash and Acrobat. They usually also support only
mainstream platforms.

Andreas

Hi to all!

I already mentioned .. It seems that there's no _must_ to do the 
hackfest at this date in vienna..
If there are other (and better) places I'm open to come there too.

I were just at the university and asked and got acceptance immediately.

I told them that I've to ask first and if Vienna is accepted I'll 
contact them with further plans.
I think theres enough time to think about it - and all I can say is: 
"Vienna is ready for it"

I'll continue with arrangements and search for hotels .. At least I can 
use this information later on..

Can someone initiate something like a "voting-page?"

regards
Werner

Hi, 

from the documentation side we had a meeting yesterday and decided that we want
to follow the unstable QGIS releases (1.1, 1.2 ...) with unstable doc releases.
At the hackfest we were thinking about a way how documenter can easily find out
in SVN what is new and should go into the documentation. 

One idea, that I prefere and seems to be simple, is that developers indicate
with a short SVN commit comment, such as [MANUAL] or sth. else, if something is
added, update or enhancement that should be mentioned in the manual. Then we
can grep it from svn and know where to search for the new feature or feature
update/enhancement. 

Please tell us, if you agree with this procedure and maybe Tim can add some
notes to the CODING guide then. It would save us a lot of time! For features
that are already committed to trunk for the 1.1 release, it would be great if
you send a short comment to the community list, so we don't miss it.

BTW: I hope we can establish this as a general arrangement, because also for the
stable 1.0.x versions, I think it would make sense to add the SVN commit comment
[MANUAL], if it is a feature update/enhancement that should go into the manual.

Any other ideas are welcome. 

regards,
 Otto

Did you guys know about this

I think we better make sure to get that info updated. The download link
is to download.qgis.org so that should be ok.

Hi all.
I think some of the most important issues about a location for a
hackfest are:
- the availability of cheap and comfortable places to sleep (do not
know: I suppose Vienna is an expensive place)
- low-cost airport (I think Vienna is OK: devs, please check if there is
a good connection with your place)
- of course, a large room with very good bandwidth.
Anything else?
All the best.

The question is not whether we like those formats, the question is that in
Catalonia we have 303 1:25000 RC orthoimages + 303*4 1:5000 RC orthoimages,
acquired at least twice in most of the country, actually 4 times in many 
cases,
+ additional cover in 1:25000 CIR for most of the country, some of it 
twice. All this
is freely distributed by our mapping agency as MrSid format.
Therefore, there is simply no room for a system not being able to read 
this imagery here.

I do not know for the rest of Spain, but at least for Andalucia the 
situation
is similar. I can look into it in more detail. I'm not sure which is the 
situation
in other European countries, can try to look into that as well.

And the data in the zulu server are 2 worldwide coverages of landsat 
images. Not
insignificant either.

I'm also starting to ask in the gdal list, but a developer would know 
better how to handle this issue.
My point is that this is not "just a gdal issue". For qgis users, this 
is a qgis issue. Maybe
this type of support is not seen as urgent in the gdal community, but 
our requests might
make them change their mind.

Thanks a lot Tim.
Will 1.0.1 release be based on the "old" code at the time of initial
release, or will it include recent patches?
All devs, can you point out which will be the main new features of 1.1,
so testing will be concentrated on these? I know of the SpatiaLite
provider from Sandro, which seems to work smoothly, of the diagrams from
Marco, and BEATA from Martin (I'm having issues on this with GRASS
tables, more testing later). Anything else?
All the best, and many thanks.

I absolutely disagree. I'm not the question, I can compile (provided
the appropriate directions are there). The problem is that if my 30 
students twice a year have to
compile or, worse, have to hire someone to do it in order to
be able to use mrsid/ecw, they will just keep using windows. Or not 
using qgis.

Linux cannot be a system for which you have to either become
able of compiling QGIS or hire someone to do it. If this were the case,
binaries should not be distributed.

Hi Werner

Thank you for the organisation. In my opinion Vienna is a very nice place for a hackfest, so +1 from my side.

I think the expensiveness is not so bad (at least compared to Zurich). And the location in the center of Europe makes it easily accessible for most community members (and Tim is used to long distance flights anyway :-) )

Regards,
Marco

Hi to all!

I already mentioned .. It seems that there's no _must_ to do the 
hackfest at this date in vienna..
If there are other (and better) places I'm open to come there too.

I were just at the university and asked and got acceptance immediately.

I told them that I've to ask first and if Vienna is accepted I'll 
contact them with further plans.
I think theres enough time to think about it - and all I can say is: 
"Vienna is ready for it"

I'll continue with arrangements and search for hotels .. At least I can 
use this information later on..

Can someone initiate something like a "voting-page?"

regards
Werner

yes - +1 for me ;-)

It is a good idea to expose more universities to QGIS. After all it is the
students that somehow can infiltrate government orgs/companies with
open-source software.

Maybe we could also invite the geographers or other university
institutions (which I still know from my university time in Vienna) to
join a QGIS presentation as well.

so in my opinion you should contact the companies involved with MrSID and
ecw to change their licence in some sort of dual licence like other
companies did (e.g. Trolltech, MySQL). After all they are interested in
widespread use of their technology - so they should open up and change
their licence so it can become a regular component of gdal/ogr. Otherwise
I don't see an easy solution.

An alternative would be to ask the data providers for their original data.
I am sure they have their data somehwer available with lossless
compression - they wouldn't throw their originals away - would they? Both
MrSID and ECW are lossy compressions ...

Hi, I'm trying to add a simple vector layer, but with no success.

I use this python code:

       layer = QgsVectorLayer("D:\temp\circoscr.shp", "circoscr", "ogr")

Here are the temp contents:

29/06/2007  07.56             1.538 circoscr.dbf
29/06/2007  07.56            36.452 circoscr.shp
29/06/2007  07.56               196 circoscr.shx

I can open it in QGIS.

But If I execute that python command, it gives me an error:

Failed to load

why?

Andreas,

LizardTech does not provide source code for the decoder sdk.  You need
to register and download the appropriate binary sdk kit for your
platform and compiler.

It does, for x86.

I agree.  All I can say is that within the limitations of their model
LizardTech has went out of their way to try and support quite a few
platforms, and to provide licensing that is easy to swallow for
distribution with non-GPL software.

 Perhaps you could run a workshop on open-source geospatial as well? I
know a good set of source materials :)

 I'd like to suggest Lancaster University as a location for a hackfest
in the future. Cheap accommodation in the student halls, cheap flights
from the US to Manchester Airport, cheap trains for the Europeans
maybe. Cheap beer.

 I have been wondering if 'Hackfest' is the right name. Clearly 'code
sprint' is wrong since there's other things to do apart from coding,
but I'm not sure if the 'hack' in 'Hackfest' is quite right. How does
"QGis Development Days", or 'Dev Days" sound? Not as catchy... Other
ideas?

 Backslashes are escape characters in python. Try with forward
slashes, or doubled-backslashes:

 QgsVectorLayer("D:\\temp\\circoscr.shp",...etc...)

 QgsVectorLayer("D:/temp/circoscr.shp",...etc)

I'm sure we've all made this mistake more than once....

Note that if you are doing file and dir operations in python you
should be using the os.path module, and not stringing together strings
with things like: path = dirName + "/" + filename + "." +
fileExtension - the os.path module provides routines for doing this
kind of thing in a platform-independent way.

I like the name hackfest. It is a nice courtesy to the german speaking
community ;-) 

Cheap Beer is a strong argument to make a hackfest at Lancaster
University.

Message-ID: <e32d76a10904020807q176ff93er8b7dcabac9fbae89@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I read the QGIS API
documentation<http://doc.qgis.org/stable/modules.html>and tried to
implement it. I have some questions/problems and I would like
you to help me:

1. Is it possible to set the canvas scale manually? The only method I see is
in MapRenderer class but it is not accessible for canvas.mapRenderer() (I
get AttributeError: setScale).

2. Is it possible to set the canvas SRS manually? I only see this method on
QgsMapLayer.

3. I get some "class is not defined" with QgsRunProcess and QgsMapTip. How I
should reference them? I have the qgis.core and qgis.gui imports. These are
the 1% of the API in C++ which is not in the bindings? :P

4. Implementing the QgsMapTool class I have no way to get the DoubleClick
event, I did this:
    -------------
    def canvasDoubleClickEvent(self,event):
        print "Yes"
    -------------
   But it doesn't work. I get two Raise events instead of DoubleClick one.
(I really want the DoubleClick event)

Thanks for the project and for the bindings.

In-Reply-To: <49C3352D.90007@wildintellect.com>
References: <49C3352D.90007@wildintellect.com>
Message-ID: <49D519C4.1020000@wildintellect.com>

I've only heard mumbles on the side, so I'll try to explain where I'm
going with this. I think it would be good for fostering plugin
development if we had a more collective place where new developers could
 put together their stuff.

I'm particularly looking at examples like http://trac-hacks.org/ where
plugin developers all share a code repo and have their own page/folder
for development. All the other developers could technically help on any
plugin hosted there, and releases can be hosted from one unofficial
repository.

Right now, I've got a plugin I want to release but it was a team effort
and will continue to be. We used sourceforge to collaborate but it's not
a good platform for a qgis repo to be hosted. In fact I can't figure out
how to do it without violating sourceforge rules.

Moving the release to another server at my lab or the qgis contributed
or official will work short term, but it would rely on me to be the
person who always packages a new version for release. I worry that's not
robust enough of solution.

Any ideas, thanks,
Alex

Hi Martin,

turns out to be much simpler than we thought: libpq does SSL by default
and JDBC doesn't.

I made that configurable in the postgres connection dialog in r10456 and
w/o SSL the rendering time for my sample layer with ~180000 polygons
drops from 20s to 10s...

I have no problem with hackfest...its short & snappy and keeps (some of)
the people happy. That said I have this kinda daft and crazy idea to
make a yearly conference with a not-only-hacking focus. The idea would
be to host a kinda mini academic conference where for the first day we
have poster sessions, talks and paper presentations. After that we
commence with hacking proper. I know it will probably be humble
beginnings, but I would like to see QGIS establish itself as a research
platform both for the idea in and of itself, and because of the
inevitable trickle down effect that will happen with new features and
improvements making their way into QGIS.

Regards

Tim

I think we can implement possibility for collaboration in the Contributed Repo. 
Every author would be able to give privileges to others for each of his plugins.

Even at the present state there is a technical possibility for collaboration, 
but we have to discuss whether it should be permitted or not... You can register 
an account for a team instead of a person. Of course someone would have to be 
personally responsible for such account...

No it will be the codebase as it was at time of the 1.0.1 branching.
1.0.2 will include more recent patches.

This name will be changed before release to comply with QGIS naming
guidelines.

There is Godofredo's new add vector dialog. There are the proper theme
support updates for core plugins from Borys. There are updates to the
plugin installer. No doubt there are a heap of other things that dont
immediately come to mind...

Not so crazy, especially if adjacent to a similar meeting who could
attract more people. Given the number of conferences, a standalone one
could make life difficult to many.

 A Qgis User Meeting? Marvellous idea. The R stats package community
has done this kind of thing for a few years, but has, I reckon, a much
larger user-base.

 Another idea from R - and now we're drifting off-topic into general
publicity items - is an N-monthly newsletter containing news,
comments, code snippets and short application descriptions - perhaps
like the OSGeo journal [http://www.osgeo.org/journal] will be.

 It's hard to know when a project has enough momentum to make user
meetings or newsletters worth doing - clearly the whole of OSGeo has
it, but does a single project like QGis? We probably won't know until
we try...

After some investigation, I decided to not "copy" a new qgis.bat (like that
located in osgeo4w\bin directory), but to point to the original qgis.bat.

I discovered another strange thing: ECW rendering is fast only on two PCs,
while in eight PCs is awful slow. All PCs share the same hardware. Any idea
on why is happening this? Investigating...

We're just on time for organizing a QGIS user meeting + hackfest
within or adjacent to the next foss4g in Barcelona, I've been talking
to the organizers, but we should take a decision on this now so that I
can start taking the necessary steps soon. Planing and organization
of the foss4g conference takes a long time.

Hi Carson.
Apparently the tool "Select by location" has a bug: the button "Browse"
to open an output shp does not work.
I guess it's an easy and quick fix, isn't it?

Yes it is... in fact, that shouldn't even be there, as it's a selection 
tool -> no output to generate in the first place! I have fixed this in 
rev 10459. I will likely make a repo update this weekend with this fix 
(though I'd like to find a few more if possible...).

I made up a python plugin a while ago that mostly works to convert a 
point layer (or selected points) into a .gpx file to make it easier to 
select a bunch of points to put on a GPS unit. We wanted it for when we 
are prospecting for new fossil sites so that we don't visit old sites, 
especially as we have up to 20 people in the field at once. The problem 
is I need resolution less than 10 metres, but I can't figure out how to 
retrieve the full data for a point using QgsFeature.geometry(). From 
what I can see, python (or something) rounds the points off to 6 digits, 
which means something like 106.23245 degrees W becomes 106.232 degrees W 
(around 40 metres or so; a fair bit when some sites are around only 1 
square metre). I know the data is there, because the original layer 
shows the finer scale resolution, and if I select and copy the points 
from the original layer and then paste into a text document, it shows 
the full point location.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.
Cheers
Matthew

Drawing my roadlines of South Africa layer which has 1 137 339 features

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Where to upload Plug-Ins?
Message-ID: <op.urvh7x16na7rjy@aspire5612.lan>

I just uploaded a new version of "FindByAttribute"-Plug-in to  
http://spatialserver.net:3001/.

Now I cant find it with the plug-in installer. Is there a new location  
where to upload plug-ins for qgis1.0 or did I make some other mistake?

Thanks,
Anita

Yes, go to http://pyqgis.org to find the link for contributing 1.0  
plugins.

Yes. That repository is only for QGIS 0.x! For 1.x we have the new repository: 
http://pyqgis.org/admin/contributed/

But I'm not sure if creating multiple plugins (findbyattr and findbyattr_v03) is 
a good idea... It makes a little mess at users' machines. If you feel your 
version can be considered stable I would rather replace the old findbyattr 
instead.

Hi Borys,

I'm aware of this. We'll do a rebranding to QgsAttributeTable* classes soon.

Someone probably forgot to add this function to python bindings...
I've revised the bindings and fixed this (and few more missing
functions) in svn trunk (r10467) and it will be included in version
1.1.

But I don't think setScale() is the right method. In fact it just a
workaround for map composer to show layers with scale-based visibility
correctly. I'm not aware of direct method that would do it. You can
check QgsScaleCalculator code that calculates scale from map extent -
so you should be able to do inverse calculation.

Yes, you can do it by setting destination CRS in map renderer
associated with map canvas.

Right :)
In case you need them, I can create those wrappers...

I have no idea about this one. The bindings are in place, so the
problem might be in dispatch of double click from canvas.

Thanks for reporting back the problems :)

Hi Matthew,

please can you provide us with a sample python script (and gpx file)
that shows this problem? That would help us to find out root of the
problem. There should be no rounding of the coordinates...

Message-ID: <681d07c20904042103q4e5b143ale9a11a49683c374b@mail.gmail.com>

I'm interesting in adding the ability to handle comments for the
delimited text layer plugin.  In Excel and openoffice, comments are
handled by specifying the line number to start at.  In R, a comment
character can be specified, defaulting to #. Python's csv.reader does
not have default comment handling, but it doesn't take much code.

Would this be useful to anyone else?

Also, where does the source live?  I poked around in svn and checked
the plugin repositories, but i didn't see it.

thanks,

This is probably the first important difference between the 1.0 and 1.1 API.What 
about creating a wiki page with a change list?

Ideally login should be the same as for trac.osgeo.org
I think a collaborative platform is much needed for python plugins.

Maybe someone could add the new repository to the wiki page  
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PluginRepositories

I can't delete version 0.2 as it was uploaded by Mauricio. But maybe after  
some trial time, Mauricio could delete the old version.

I've removed them both to not produce multiple plugins in users' systems.
Please upload the 0.3 version as just findbyattr.zip (and the same directory 
inside)

We definitely need a possibility for collaboration in the contributed repo.
Gary, what about possibility for giving write permissions for particular 
plugins? Plugin author and repository admins could give them to any other user 
or even change the ownership.

No, it's there. But that doesn't seem to be a recently introduced
problem.  I get the same with GRASS 6.4.0rc3 on Linux - with 6.3 it's
fine.

Looks like the "buffer" parameter was removed in 6.4.  v.buffer
--interface-description doesn't report it anymore.


> Should I file a ticket? On qgis trac or on the installer?

QGIS trac.   More to consider: v.buffer is even deprecated in favour of
v.buffer2.

Trying it with trunk and my Qgis 1.0.1 in the Spearfish dataset -  
runs.  Though the requirement of a vector overlay is a nuisance, it  
should be optional.

Try updating to 1.0.1?

Make sure you have my latest GRASS 6.4rc3 app.

I get that also, even in trunk.  I don't know what's up here.  Someone  
did mention (offlist) to me that viewing the attribute tables of GRASS  
vector doesn't always show the values, even though they're there in  
the table (ie when viewed directly in GRASS).  Just viewing the simple  
attribute tables in the Spearfish data, I see a lot of missing cat  
values.  I referred him to the list but he hasn't asked the list yet.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] end of Portuguese course
Message-ID: <49D8F801.2070504@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Just finished a QGIS+GRASS course in Portugal. Almost everything went
well, I have opened several tickets, but overall people were
enthusiastic about this, and most said the could replace their
proprietary software with QGIS+GRASS.
Every time I do a course things go better.
Thanks to all, and especially to Carson, whose real-time fix left people
astonished: this is a result I think cannot be achieved with *any* other
GIS, either proprietary or free, and of course python is a major
advantage here.
All the best!

Sorry I wasn't more specific before, but I did get what I wanted 
eventually using the exportToWkt() function. I was using asPoint() 
before, and it was giving me the shortened values. Not sure if this 
should be noted somewhere in the API (or if it already is and I missed it)
Cheers

The asPoint() function must not do any changes to the geometry. I
suspect that the loss of precision happened when doing conversion to
string - check out this:

>>> "%f" % 123.4567890123456789
'123.456789'

for better precision, override the precision:

>>> "%.9f" % 123.4567890123456789
'123.456789012'

Well, this is actually a bugfix - these methods have been there in C++
for some time already, so it's not really a difference in apI...

You're right, not in the API but in the Python API... You know, I mean plugin 
authors using this binding on 1.1 should be aware they can't declare minimum API 
as 1.0.

All,

Our class has ended and we have a very early stage plugin available for
tinkering. Currently it's more of a metadata reader but we hope to get
full read/write in the coming months. As such we would like to invite
any interested parties to help out on the plugin in any way that you
like, coding, gui design, research on xml standards, xml rendering in
web pages, documentation etc.

All you need is a sourceforge account, the project trac is
http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/qgismetaedit/

The initial release is in the User Contributed Repo, although I
recommend you svn checkout to stay up to date and to have access to more
testing files.

If you are interested in commit access just send me an email.

Thanks,
Alex

If I understand correctly, the work would happen here, by passing in
either n or x, and skipping the appropriate lines:
( https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgis/src/plugins/delimited_text/qgsdelimitedtextplugingui.cpp
)

QString QgsDelimitedTextPluginGui::readLine( QTextStream & stream )
{
  QString buffer( "" );
  QString c;

  // Strip leading newlines

  c = stream.read( 1 );
  if ( c == NULL || c.size() == 0 )
  {
    // Reach end of file
    return buffer;
  }
  while ( c == ( char * )"\r" || c == ( char * )"\n" )
  {
    c = stream.read( 1 );
    if ( c == NULL || c.size() == 0 )
    {
      // Reach end of file
      return buffer;
    }
  }

 Hi Alex:

 

I have downloaded your plugin and in my windows xp machine and have found the following:

 

* Open template fails with the message "loadDoc:: Failed to load: C:/Documents and Settings/freddy/.qgis/python/plugins/metaedit/Templates/xml/ISO19139_elements_es.xml 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf3' in position 7: ordinal not in range(128)"

Message-ID: <49DA45EF.5060100@jemila.jazztel.es>

Hello all
While checking translation of shortcuts in qgis_es.ts, I've seen those
translated are not working. For example, in File menu this is what I
have (r10484):
                               EN                     ES

              Yes
Open project:  Ctrl+O               Ctrl+A                       Ctrl+A 
              No

   Where does this Ctrl+S in gui come from?

Ctrl+S                No
It's supposed that if these shortcuts are in ts file they should work if
translated, but it doesn't seem to work.
There is also some other estrange behaviour under View menu

Ah, yes some xml documents aren't loading. You are the second person to
report such an issue, and we now have a hint to look at handling the
character encoding more gracefully.

I encourage people to file bugs on our project trac
http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/qgismetaedit/

I'm pretty sure all you need is a sourceforge account.

Thanks,
Alex

Message-ID: <1239086313222-2597278.post@n2.nabble.com>


hi devs and Dr.Marco,

I have a question regarding how can i make a rendering to my vector layer display. Lets me explain a little bit of my scenario; i need to load a building layer that contain a lot of data and it take some time to load. So, my plan is to render it by drawing a certain number of features first before updating the display. It's look like on QGis Edit>>Options>>Rendering>>Rendering Behavior panel and we can set "Number of features to draw before updating the display" = 10000(or some others value).
Hope you guys can help me on this matters.


Thanks in advance,
bonar

Hi Bonar

To update the display after 1000 features, you may do the following:

QSetting s;
s.setValue( "/Map/updateThreshold", 1000);

Like this, the vector layer sends the signal QgsMapLayer::screenUpdateRequested each 1000 features and the slot QgsMapCanvas:: updateMap refreshes the map image. If you are using QgsMapCanvas in your application, the signals of the layers are automatically connected to the refresh slot.

In a similar way, you may set other properties., e.g. to make your map appear nicer, do 

s.setValue( "/qgis/enable_anti_aliasing", true);

You might have a look at src/app/qgsoptions.cpp for the other options.

Regards,

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Number of features to draw before updating thedisplay..
 

hi devs and Dr.Marco,

I have a question regarding how can i make a rendering to my vector layer display. Lets me explain a little bit of my scenario; i need to load a building layer that contain a lot of data and it take some time to load. So, my plan is to render it by drawing a certain number of features first before updating the display. It's look like on QGis Edit>>Options>>Rendering>>Rendering Behavior panel and we can set "Number of features to draw before updating the display" = 10000(or some others value).
Hope you guys can help me on this matters.


Thanks in advance,
bonar

Message-ID: <21AFCE29-FB16-4B20-8439-2DA3FE509F04@kyngchaos.com>

I was looking at the vector overlay sources to add them to the Xcode  
project and noticed that the 3 vector overlay sources are directly in  
the plugins folder.

qgsvectoroverlayplugin.cpp
qgsvectoroverlayplugin.h
qgsapplydialog.h

Shouldn't they have their own subfolder, to keep things organized?   
And I don't see any cmakelists.txt that refer to these.

Hi all.
Is anybody working, or planning to work, on this?
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1471
I think this may be the cause of several other grass-shell related bugs,
and it is worth fixing. Furthermore, qt3 is now very old, and likely not
to be supported any more soon.
All the best.

Hi William

The overlay plugin classes do not belong to a particular plugin. It's just two abstract base classes for a new type of plugin, therefore they are at the same place as qgisplugin.h.

>And I don't see any cmakelists.txt that refer to these.

Good observation. qgsvectoroverlayplugin.cpp is empty and should be deleted from svn.

Regards,
Marco

Another bit from the vector overlay changeset, I'm not sure what it  
means: the *.hpp sources in the libpal are in the core QGIS_CORE_SRCS  
list to compile.  They're also #included from other sources in  
libpal.  Is this right?

Barry,

It appears that your selectplus plugin is causing crashes, at least on  
my OS X setup, when tyring to load postgis layers or project files  
with postgis layers in the current source for qgis.

Hi Dr.Marco,

Thanks for your quick reply, i'm glad to get my trainer reply my email.  I will try the code and will inform you the output.

Thank you so much Dr.Marco,
bonar


Hi Bonar

To update the display after 1000 features, you may do the following:

QSetting s;
s.setValue( "/Map/updateThreshold", 1000);

Like this, the vector layer sends the signal QgsMapLayer::screenUpdateRequested each 1000 features and the slot QgsMapCanvas:: updateMap refreshes the map image. If you are using QgsMapCanvas in your application, the signals of the layers are automatically connected to the refresh slot.

In a similar way, you may set other properties., e.g. to make your map appear nicer, do 

s.setValue( "/qgis/enable_anti_aliasing", true);

You might have a look at src/app/qgsoptions.cpp for the other options.

Regards,
Marco

Hi William

Those hpp files come from the pal library. From what I understood, they are .cpp and .h file in one. So I think it is no problem if they are compiled and included from other libpal files.

Hm, strange. The path to geos headers is already entered in CMakeList.txt:

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(
     ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} ${GEOS_INCLUDE_DIR}
     ../../core ../../core/pal ../../core/raster ../../core/renderer ../../core/symbology
     ../../gui
     ..

On my Linux box, it picks up the path correctly. I have no idea why it doesn't work for you.

I guess I should try a cmake build to see if it causes problems, but  
it looks like they just define class templates.  I don't know much  
about C++ but that doesn't seem like code that works on its own.

I'm just trying to decide if I need to create a custom rule in Xcode  
to process the hpp files as C++ files, or if the includes are good  
enough.

Hi all.
If I select the diagrams, and let various fields in (area and perimeter,
with largely different absolute values), I get a crash:
...

Hi all.
I think Ivan plugin is a valuable one, and will help spreading QGIS also
in situations where now it's unusable, because data are in Oracle.
AFAICT, there should be no licensing problems (we have discussed about
this rather extensively offlist), though it might be worth the while to
double check.
I cannot judge the quality of its code, but I would ask devs to revise
it, and if acceptable to give Ivan svn access, so he will be able to
upload and maintain the plugin.
Any thoughts?

From Greg Coats:

For the Charleston, South Carolina urban area, I have quantity=1360,  
0.60 meter resolution georeferenced GeoJP2 images.  I have created  
several reduced-resolution mosaic images, that in effect form a 25 GB  
image pyramid.  When zoomed out, for any particular scale, it is only  
necessary to draw pixels from one (not all) of the reduced resolution  
mosaic images.  I have built an ESRI ArcGIS interface that provides  
for easy seamless panning, and zooming in, and out through all of  
these images.

I would like to have prepared a functionally similar, easy to use,  
QGIS project file that would access, based on the current scale, the  
appropriate mosaic image, and as the user zooms in, seamlessly  
display the appropriate GeoJP2 image.  The GDAL utility gdalbuildvrt  
would be used to define the boundaries of the 1360, full resolution  
images.  I am seeking to pay someone to develop the QGIS project  
file.  If you are interested, then please contact me.

Hi Mauricio

Will the add button allow you to add multiple rasters to build a vrt
'catalogue' - equivalent to what gdalbuildvrt is doing from the command
line with the file list option?

Are you writing this in C++ or python?

Thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mac users: comments wanted on Xcode project
Message-ID: <E61F1D2A-65AD-419D-9688-97099E792333@kyngchaos.com>

Well, for a while now, I've been keeping an eye on commits and  
updating the Xcode project (in trunk/v1.1) as needed.  It's gone quite  
smoothly, except for large commits getting filtered out of the commit  
list so that I miss them for a while.

But, except for one person that's had some trouble with it (resolved)  
and given me a few ideas that I've implemented, the Mac users and  
developers have been pretty quiet.  Have the Mac folk tried using the  
Xcode project to build Qgis?  I would like to hear some feedback.   
Some things in particular to think about:

- Does the configuration make sense?  Is it simple enough to not scare  
people away?  It's a manual configure by editing a text file, though  
out of the box it should work with my frameworks and a few standard  
extras without any config edits.

The current configuration also does not verify dependencies.  But for  
many cases, this is unnecessary, like system libraries, because it's  
not trying to understand many very different systems, only OSX.  If  
something isn't found where expected or configured, you won't find out  
until the build fails.

A configure script is on my list of things to look into.  Maybe it's  
possible to hook into the cmake configuration, that would be nice...

- Most optional features are requirements in the Xcode project due to  
the lack of conditional sources (for things where a complete source  
file is added to core or gui components).  Plugins are optional in a  
manual fashion - select the target and build.  Source fragments are  
conditional in the usual #ifdef manner.  This could be used to wrap  
optional sources into an #ifdef + #include, if there is interest in  
having the same configurability as the cmake build, but I'm not sure  
it would work for moc sources.

- Debugging - has anyone tried debugging Qgis from the Xcode GUI?  I  
don't know much about it, though I did debug a program once in Xcode  
(or, I successfully started the debugging process, but didn't  
understand the output enough to track down the problem).

- Bundling - I've tested bundling of dependencies in the default  
framework-based configuration + a couple libraries where needed.  I  
haven't tried an all-in-one bundling of only libraries, like Tom's  
build.  It should work.  It's even possible to bundle frameworks  
(other than the Qt frameworks, which are always bundled) for a  
framework-based all-in-one, but I haven't had a chance to test this.

There is also an option to bundle extra non-Qgis files.  This was  
necessary for a PyQt addon (Qwt5) needed for a plugin.  I found that  
this PyQt addon (possibly others) must be in the PyQt namespace, thus  
must be bundled with PyQt in Qgis.  This is unfortunate as it goes  
against OSX conventions that addons/plugins/... should not be added to  
an application package as a separate installation, but instead be  
installed in a known plugin location for the app (Qgis python plugins  
do this, of course).  So, in this case, you couldn't add a plugin  
based on Qwt5 to a standard distributed Qgis app.

Funny you should ask---I tried it today and had trouble that was  
resolved by starting with a clean (checked out) source tree. I found  
that editing a .ui file and doing a build didn't pick up the changes.  
A clean was required first.

It would make sense if I had a clue :) I'm afraid I still don't know  
my way around the source and target folders very well.

Yes I tried this today. The only problem was I don't seem to have the  
debug libraries for Qt so it wasn't all that helpful for the task at  
hand. Otherwise I think it will be quite useful.

Overall I find the Xcode project useful and worth continuing. Thanks  
for all the hard work.

Hmm... maybe you had some compiled ui files left over from a cmake  
build that confused the Xcode build.  Xcode saves its intermediate  
files in a different location than the cmake build, but compilation  
will still see the cmake-generated copies.

Would more explanation of the project layout help?  Though, the  
configuration doesn't really need much understanding of the source and  
targets.  The readme should cover what's needed.

[replying to myself]

A quick look at the top level cmakelists.txt looks promising.  I could  
run a CONFIGURE_FILE() macro on a qgis_user.xcconfig.in.  Some config  
var adjustments may be needed to conform to Xcode configuration  
conventions, but it looks very possible.  You would just do a normal  
cmake configure and it would generate the xcconfig, then you fire up  
Xcode and build instead of running make.  The xcconfig would be  
reusable and customizable, just like a manual configuration.  (this  
would be a separate thing from the Xcode option in cmake, mentioned a  
while back, which generates the whole Xcode project and didn't work  
very well)

Message-ID: <7a30cd70904102216r7b29f4ffy10cbe69c5a4b6855@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I was reading through some old post and found this
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2008-March/002423.html
even thought the solution is great. But I am still trying to find a solution
that work in C++ completely.

I was able to manage to plot the data (present point .. in future could be
also have Polygon and Lines) by placing a blank shapefile with desire data
structure (created on loading of QGisApp) and loading it to the mapper,
thereafter plotting the data using the QTimer event.

But the very basic functionality of QGis is not coming up as desire. Like I
wanted to read the attributes of the realtime data which I had pushed with
as per the data structure in QGis. I only receive attribute of X and Y back
from point being plotted. Have anybody device some logic to retrieve the
same.

A query that come to my mind, is it possible to replace the my input
shapefile in realtime at the background and the data and attribute updated
get reflected to the Mapper without enabling the editing options or
reloading the shapefile.

Any Input or pointers would be appreciated.

Best Regards

Abhay.

Hi all.
I am using a server, probably misconfigured, that is loaded correctly,
but when I right-click "Projection", QGIS eats up a lot of RAM and CPU,
starts writing to disk, and I have to kill it. It is probably a problem
on the server side, but nevertheless QGIS should behave better in these
cases, I guess.
If anybody is interested in checking this, I can provide the address of
the server (it is not meant for general public view for the moment).

Hi all.
I try to keep the (loooong) ticket queue tidy, removing duplicates,
closing fixed bugs, etc. I think too many unverified bugs will distract
the attention of developers, and will give a bad general impression of
the whole project.
I think it would be good to have a policy for closing non confirmed and
obsolete bugs. If I cannot replicate the bug, I am asking the reporter
to check them again against a new QGIS version, to provide additional
info, or the data that caused the crash, etc.
What should we do when the reporter does not reply, and the bus is
apparently not replicable? I would be inclined to close it down after,
say, a week; the reporter gets notified anyway, and (s)he can reopen the
ticket at will.
Any thoughts?

I suspect the issue is that you havent specified the CRS list for the
server - are you using geoserver by any chance? What happens is that
QGIS then pulls down thousands of CRS defs and its obviously not dealing
with that well...

Hi List (mainly Tim),
I wonder whether it's a good idea to show the version number in the title bar. 
It's convenient if we run various versions, but it takes a lot of place and 
looks bad. Especially in a 'mac-style' menu, where it's also put as the first 
menu. See the screenshot: http://www.bwj.aster.net.pl/temp/qgiswindowtitle.png

I see what Borys means, on OSX the Qgis window titles are:

Quantum GIS - 1.1.0-Unstale-trunk

Quantum GIS - 1.0.1-Kore

The menubar does not have the version on OSX.  I agree that having the  
full app name and version in the titlebar is messy.  If I want to know  
the version, I'll check the About window.  Also, when a project has  
been saved, thus named, the project filename gets run together with  
the version in the titlebar:

Quantum GIS - 1.1.0-Unstale-trunk MyProject

I think the titlebar should have *only* the project title, and  
"Untitled" for a new unsaved project.

I just realized that I forgot about the "debug" variations of  
libraries on OSX.  Kindof a neat mechanism so standard and debug  
copies can live side-by-side - add _debug to a library or framework  
name, and a special link flag will automatically link that variation.   
Not a big deal for libraries, but necessary for frameworks, since  
there is no flexibility in framework names otherwise.

So, I need to add an option to use the debug variations of the Qt  
frameworks.  But I'm not sure if -DQT_DEBUG requires the debug  
variations, or if it is useful on its own with the standard Qt  
frameworks.

Poking around today - should QGIS_VERSION_INT be updated to coincide  
with the trunk version?  Currently:

SET(QGIS_VERSION_INT 10000)

For some reason I changed it to '10100' in the Xcode project config  
when I first set that up, but the cmakelists.txt still has 10000.

I just want to make sure - that's really '11000'?  I would have  
thought something like Mmmpp for Major/minor/patch, 0-padded, thus  
'10100' for 1.1.0.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SpatiaLite data provider - fixup
Message-ID: <49E0FB89.9010502@lqt.it>

Hi,

I've just fixed a couple of  issues related to the SpatiaLite data provider:

a) I've fixed a stupid bug in libspatialite-2.3.0, causing a total
   failure for any Spatial Index based on MbrCache; consequently
   I've updated the QGis' INTERNAL spatialite.c

b) in the meanwhile I was performing some testing about the previous
   issue, then I found a second issue this time causing total failure 
for any
   Spatial Index based on RTree. I noticed this using the OSgeo4W qgis-dev.
   After some debugging I discovered that the problem wasn't any SpatiaLite
   bug, but the cause was in CMake definitions QGis applies to build 
INTERNAL
   spatialite, and so I've modified -/src/core/CMakeLists.txt
    
=========================================================================

sqlite3.c / spatialite.c require some extra CFLAGS to be set:

 > ADD_DEFINITIONS(-D_LARGE_FILE=1 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 
-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE=1)
is required to support database files > 2 GB on 32 bits systems

 > ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DSQLITE_ENABLE_RTREE=1)
is absolutely required in order to enable RTrees

and I've fixed too:

< INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(spatialite/headers)
 > INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(spatialite/headers/spatialite)

in order to avoid any further need to manually adapt
#include "sqlite3ext.h" into the spatialite.c source

----------------
I noticed a second (unneeded ?) manual adaption in the previous
version of the INTERNAL spatialite.c source:

< #ifndef _MSC_VER
#include <localcharset.h>
< #endif

this sounds quite strange to me, because localcharset.h is strictly
required for ICONV-Windows; this header is easily available at:
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libiconv.htm

The _MSC_VER macro is a typical MSVC marker, so it looks like
some problem arises from this header while compiling on MSVC,
may be in the OSgeo4W build ???
Any further explanationion on this point is welcome.

Anyway I believe it would be by far better avoiding to
introduce any "manual adaption" in the INTERNAL QGis
spatialite.c source,  so to make easier updating this latter
simply replacing the current 'amalgamation' source just as it is.

bye,
Sandro

I added a BEFORE there - otherwise qgis might pickup the sqlite3ext.h
from the systemwide sqlite install instead of the internal one.

That's because iconv in OSGeo4W doesn't have localcharset.h.

Please contact the server administrator, root@localhost and inform them

More generally, it is quite slow: perhaps it's time to ask OSGeo to

Also, the server appears partly misconfigured, and based on a rather old

Hving the version in the title bar is a useful reminder of which QGIS
version you are using. Under a 'real' mac osx it shows only 'QGIS' in
the top menu bar, so your KDE menu bar isnt a faithful replica.

That said we could look at changing this in the next release cycle
because I do appreciate that 'normal' users probably dont care to see
that extra stuff there....

 With a little iface.mainWindow().setWindowTitle(...) magic we can set
the title bar to anything from a python plugin. So when you've decided
on a sensible default we can let the advanced user have a title that
can be anything, with version and project strings being replacements
of %v, %p, and so on.

That should keep everyone happy, and might make a nice simple plugin
project for a beginner.

Sure, it was just a thought abbreviation, I mean: "also some external menu bars, 
which put the window title as the first menu can be affected" ;-)

Yes, they would rather see the project name better exposed, as I can suppose :)

Hi All,
Has anybody used qtCreator with qgis source code for development purpose.
If so could you please post the step to how to implement the same.

Hello All,

As per the earlier post. I tried out some interim method.
I was able to implement a imperfect solution using 2 method, but both had
problems of there own.

1) I used the technique stated in MapTool to draw my layer on the
QgsMapCanvas to do a partial step.  Also using a base of blank shapefile
(for datastructure/fieldname and attribute) and placing the data in the
Memory to render to QgsVectorLayer using QgsFeature. But this is possible
only when the layer is set to edit mode and also the feature attribute does
not seem to appear on the layer until the toggleEdit if not switched off.

2) Second method I used is push the data to file rather than pushing the to
mapper. then use toggleEdit in between and place operation to select and
remove all the feature using QgsVectorLayer invertSelection and
deleteSelectedFeatures. and do a mapRefresh() to render the new dataset.
Problem from the 1st method is solved and I have feature attribute. But a
new problem arises this method make the mapper flicker each time the new set
of data is pushed periodically.

Is there any better method if any body could suggest or hint, it would be
really helpful.

Does RubberBand support multiple featuretype like point, line and polygon? I
not sure if I can try this step.

Thanks and Rgds.

Abhay.

Great I look forward to testing it out - I would support adding this to
core distribution when you are ready since its one of the key features
we want to provide 'out of the box' with QGIS.

Hi Abhay,

I am using QtCreator with QGIS source for development purpose. I have set of *.pro files that contain the necessary lines to build QGIS on my machine. So i attached theirs and the script that put theirs in properly directories. To use it put the archive in QGIS directory and unzip, then change dir to prodir and run script ./pro_file_struct. After that you should correct some .pro files to build QGIS (if you have some packages in no standard path). Well, i hope it will be useful :)

Hi G,
hi hit this one also, you needs some "@pyqtSignature" magic

see par 3.7
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/pyqt4ref.html#connecting-signals-and-slots

my problem was calling a ok button method twice:
without the "@pyqtSignature" magic, the on_btnOk_clicked will be called 
two times: one clicked() and one clicked(bool checked)

@pyqtSignature("on_btnBrowse_clicked()")
def on_btnBrowse_clicked(self):
   print 'bla'

hope this helps

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

to achieve what you need, you'll just have to create map canvas items
and put them on the canvas. Map canvas items are more flexible than
usual rendering because they can be updated any time quickly, without
affecting other parts of canvas.

You can create your own class(es) derived from QgsMapCanvasItem or you
can use one of the few that exist already in QGIS. There is
QgsVertexMarker class that's well suited for points and there is
QgsRubberBand for drawing polylines or polygons (check it in action
when measuring in qgis).

Bye
Martin

Hi,

I'm also interested in using QtCreator for qgis development, but I've
been too lazy to download and install it :)
Anyway from what I've heard, now Qt Creator should support also cmake
so there is not need to use qmake... or am I wrong?

Hi martin

As I know the new qtcreator 1.0.1 has the tool
Tool>options cmake and qt setup options.

My reason to ask for qtcreator is to know is the same app can create
in multiple platform

As I use windows most of the time switch between windows and Linux
with different IDE all the increase chance of choas all the time as
needing to remember all the time

Rdgs.

To all Mac users (of the Xcode project): I made some changes to the  
Xcode configuration, so it would be a good idea for you to check your  
qgis_user.xcconfig with the template (and clean).

There may be more changes to the template coming up, but I think I did  
everything I need - I'm working on a way for the cmake configuration  
to generate a gqis_user.xcconfig (handy for the casual user).

Thanks Richard, here [1] I found this:

* mouseDoubleClickEvent() - not quite as obvious as it might seem. If the
user double-clicks, the widget receives a mouse press event (perhaps a mouse
move event or two if he/she does not hold the mouse quite steady), a mouse
release event and finally this event. It is not possible to distinguish a
click from a double click until you've seen whether the second click
arrives. (This is one reason why most GUI books recommend that double clicks
be an extension of single clicks, rather than trigger a different action.)*

I still get two release events in QgsMapTool class.

I'm trying to do a Measure Tool, and it works. The only issue is with that
event. In QGIS the measure tool draws a rubberband and the mouse right
button stops the drawing, but I want the double click stops the drawing.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Table join in QGIS
Message-ID: <E1Lte1E-0008Ox-6h@web05.mi6.kiev.ua>

Hi, list!
  Does QGIS have ability to join tables? Can I join an attributive table of layer with an ordinary dbf or PostGIS table?
I mean SQL join, NOT spatial. For example, I have polygon layer with attributive table and two fields within it

+---------+---------+
| Shape | ICode |
+---------+---------+

and simple dbf table with many fields:

+--------+---------+------------+-----+
| Code | Name | Address | ..... |
+--------+---------+------------+-----+

Can I join this tables on field "Code"? So the result must be:

+---------+--------+---------+------------+-----+
| Shape | Code | Name | Address | ..... |
+---------+--------+---------+------------+-----+

Best regards,
  Alexander Bruy

Hi Barry and John

You mean there is a freehand plugin already available?
I also think that freehand tool should go to trunk (once the feature freeze for 1.1 is over).
In which repository is the plugin available?

cheers,
Marco

 Not quite. My "selectplus" plugin allows users to select features by
drawing a freehand polygon. The polygon is not stored anywhere/ What
John would really like is to be able to digitize features by drawing a
freehand polygon, creating new features in the current layer. I think
this is probably something that needs integrating into the existing
layer editing toolset, and so probably needs to be written in C++ in
the core.

Many thanks for your reply, Giovanni. I try Ftools, but this plugin can join only two vector layers into
one single layer. In my case one table is an attribute table of vector layer, but another table - isn't.
Second table is ordinary dbf table (without geometry), so this plugin don't work for me.

Best regards,
  Alexander

fTools works fine with standalone tables as well... you can join dbf 
tables to vector layers by doing the following:

It should work. Just select 'join dbf table' instead of 'join vector layer'.
At least in the fTools for QGIS 1.x Do you use QGIS 0.x?

Message-ID: <FD8B585C35164F1FB36733FC01955000@tmaddock3>

Hello, 

We are newcomers to QGIS and are trying to evaluate its suitability for
application to some ecological programs we have developed.  I am not sure we
are in the proper forum for our questions, which are many, but here is a
start.

 

We have developed an ArcGIS 9.2 custom application in VB 2005, .NET
framework 2.0 to derive parameters for the riparian evapotranspiration
package in MODFLOW and visualize MODFLOW groundwater results. We are
considering using QGIS to perform the geo-processing component of our
program instead of using the ESRI product.  It should be noted that MODFLOW
is a FORTRAN-90 product (yes, some people still use FORTRAN), and is used to
solve the groundwater flow equations.

 

We would like to know if QGIS provides some of the out of the box
geo-processing components such as overlay analysis and zonal statistics
similar to ArcGIS.

 

Here is the list of geo-processing tasks that we perform in our program:

 

*	Attributing vegetation polygon shapefile interactively by selecting
polygons and enter % cover values on a form

 

*	Creating finite difference grid as a polygon shapefile in order to
support irregular grid sizes

 

*	Intersecting vegetation polygon shapefile with the finite difference
grid shapefile and updating areas of the polygons

 

*	Obtaining average surface elevation per riparian polygon derived
from (DEM) and write it to vegetation polygon shapefile

 

*	Access each record in the attribute table and write values in a text
file with specific format.

 

Couple of questions:

 

*	Is there a support for relational database management such as join
and relates?

 

*	What are the supporting programming languages and can we re-use some
of the components that are already written in VB .NET in the project?

Barry is correct. I wondered if his code could be hijacked and used  
for implementing a freehand polygon drawing tool. Obviously, there is  
the python to C++ issue...

William,

I'm back to testing your Xcode project. I agree with other folks that  
this is a great and valuable addition to qgis.

Using the stock template on my 10.5 machine with your frameworks and  
nothing else non-stock, plus qt-4.5 (not 4.4), I have run into a  
couple of problems.

For some reason, an include in qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp is not getting  
picked up:
#include <Python.h>
fails to be found. If I add the full path to Python.h as:
#include </System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/ 
include/python2.5/Python.h>
I run into a new error:
/Users/jctull/sources/qgis/trunk/mac/xcode/build/native/Qgis.build/

40: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/bin/python: No  
such file or directory

I'm unclear as to why it is looking in /Library... when it should be / 
System/Library...

That is the state of things for me right now.

John

I have the default PYTHON_FORM set as 'fw', which means the python.org  
framework, because I don't know if there is a setting with build  
system (so I can set PYTHON_FORM dynamically).  It's probably there  
somewhere, I just need to look harder.

You need to set the PYTHON_FORM to system to use the Leopard Python.   
No need to hack the source.

Isn't it possible to load oracle spatial vector layers with the new ogr dialog 
in trunk?
If not, would it be an option to extend the ogr vector dialog?

I didn't noticed it before!

Yes it works. The only problem I noticed is when I select a Oracle DB that doesn't have any 
sdo_geometry. In that case, after clicking the OK bottom it created a Vector entry on the Layers 
tree but there is nothing to be shown.

Otherwise it seams to be working fine at least for reading data.

My best regards,

Ivan

Hi,

I wanted to test the vector overlay functionality (diagrams). Is it now in
trunk?

Where can I find the vector overlay settings? Is this a separate tab in
the "Layers properties" or part of the "Symbology" tab?

I compiled the latest SVN trunk version but I can't find any of the vector
overlay settings in the "Layer Properties" dialogue.

Thanks for a hint on what may be wrong with my QGIS trunk version?

It's a plugin, so you probably didn't enable it in the Manager :)

Message-ID: <200904161550.12125.borysiasty@aster.pl>

Hi (mainly Tim),

I've cleaned and refactored the Plugin Installer and finally set the version to 
1.0 :)

First of all, there were some small issues in case a few instances/versions of 
the same plugin was available (e.g. an official, an unofficial, and a testing-
experimental). Now it should always properly choose the best allowed version.

There is a question now, are we putting it to 1.1?

A big part of the code was refactored, but I've tested it on Ubuntu and WinXP, 
and no problems have occured in the most murderous situations I've prepared. 
I didn't test it on Vista, however.

I didn't implement any new features except one small warning message (displayed 
during QGIS startup in case the Installer detects that there is an obsolete 
plugin installed in the home location and it masks a newer version, shipped with 
the current QGIS installation).

yes - there are the placement algorithm options - as a separate tab in the
QGIS options.

However, I am not so sure if this should be a global setting. Shouldn't
this be layer-specific?

One layer probably should use this placement algorithm, while a different
layer might require a different placement algorithm. As an example a layer
with fewer diagrams may want to use a more sophisticated algorithm, while
a layer with lots of diagrams may want to use a faster algorithm. Also,
there may be different quality requirements for different layers or
projects.

So in my opinion the algorithm choice should be layer specific. Any
thoughts on why this is not a good idea?

Hi Tom,

I think you should try to ask this in the qgis-users list. I will 
forward this message to it ..

Short answers of some things I know:

- postgresql/postgis is a relational database which can be used with 
qgis which I think can do what you want.

- though qgis is written in c++/qt, there is a very nice python-plugin 
interface which can be used to write extensions

- most dataformats are both readable and writable

- qgis can be used as frontend of GRASS a (from what I've heard) a 
pretty powerfull opensource gis

Hope this helps a little, and maybe other people on the users list can 
help you any further.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Andreas

The placement algorithm is a global setting because the PAL library considers the objects of all layers together. Ok, it would also be possible to trigger the placement for layers individually, but it is in most cases preferrable if not diagrams from layer A overlap those of layer B.
I know that at the moment the placement gives not very good results. I'm meeting the PAL developers in two weeks to see if the code in qgis that calls the PAL library can be improved.

Regards,
Marco

yes - there are the placement algorithm options - as a separate tab in the
QGIS options.

However, I am not so sure if this should be a global setting. Shouldn't
this be layer-specific?

One layer probably should use this placement algorithm, while a different
layer might require a different placement algorithm. As an example a layer
with fewer diagrams may want to use a more sophisticated algorithm, while
a layer with lots of diagrams may want to use a faster algorithm. Also,
there may be different quality requirements for different layers or
projects.

So in my opinion the algorithm choice should be layer specific. Any
thoughts on why this is not a good idea?

My recent blog post (http://blog.qgis.org/qgis_going_closed_source)  
appears to have caused confusion for some. Be assured that the post  
was an April Fools (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_fools_day) joke.

QGIS is Free and Open Source Software and will remain so. There have  
been no changes to the project management, license, or philosophy. The  
development team is hard at work and preparing for a new release in  
the near future.

I apologize for any concern this may have caused in the community.  
Obviously my humor didn't translate well to all corners of the user  
base.

My previous QGIS April Fools joke a few years back was that we were  
porting the code from C++ to Java. Nobody believed that one...

Carson, Giovanni, thanks for yours replies.
  The problem is in my bad English. Sorry.
  Yes, fTools works, it produce a new layer with attributes, from both tables. But this is not what I want.
For my task it's necessary to have one layer with minimal attribute set and few standalone tables, which
time from time joined to the layer. In one case used one table, in another case - another table.
  I think, for this task better use PostGIS or SpatialLite...

Regards,

Alexander

 I've used PostGIS for this, and created VIEWs from my spatial table
and my data table. The spatial table is one row per feature, and the
data table has rows which have feature id, month, and rainfall in that
month.

 If I want to map rainfall in a particular month, I do a join on the
two tables, selecting the month, and joining on the feature-id. I end
up with a view that has one row per feature, keeping the_geom, and
having the rainfall for each feature in that month.

 It would be nice to have this kind of feature dynamically available
for any kind of vector layer, but then you end up duplicating an RDBMS
in Qgis. Better that we stop using shapefiles and get SpatialLite
working :)

I yes, this is a topic that was discussed at the hackfest a few weeks 
back. Currently, it is not implemented, though we hope to have something 
like this available in the future. I think there are some issues with 
the way in which layers and data are represented in QGIS at the moment, 
but this is indeed on the 'todo' list.

For now, as you mentioned, postgis or spatialight are the best solutions...

I have applied and tested this patch in my local development branch

Tom in general most of your requirements are met, some directly from
QGIS's C++ or Python api and others from the underlying libraries that
we use (gdal / ogr etc).

I can tell you that there is a *HUGE* thirst for ecological modelling
and conservation management tools based on QGIS and porting your tools
to QGIS would be exceptionally well received in third world countries
where managers and ecologists generally cant afford the extortionate (by
third world standards anyway) prices ESRI demand for their software.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Looking for new Manual Team Lead and Contributors!!
Message-ID: <20090418144902.7cd24dff@nature>

Dear QGIS users,

the QGIS project is looking for a new Manual Team Lead and new contributors. We
need help to organize, update, and revise the english "User Guide" and
"Compilation and Coding Guide" to be able to follow the upcoming new QGIS
releases.

As Manual Team Lead you would assist me to organize and take care of the english
documentation process. The job is not very difficult, but you would need to
regularly invest some time, of course. 

As Manual contributor you would be responsible for certain chapters of the two
manuals. We plan to keep the workload as low as possible. At the moment we are
looking for about 10 people to spread the ~ 250 pages evenly between
contributors. QGIS is going to release new versions (1.1, 1.2, etc) every two
months. This means there will be little but steady contributions necessary.  

As Manual Team Lead and/or Contributor you would learn a lot about teamwork and
extend your knowledge about tools like subversion, latex, wiki, irc and many
more.

We all know that time is a limiting factor, but if many people offer to spend a
little time, it won't be a burden for anybody. So as always - any contribution
you have to make will be greately appreciated ;). 

Please contact me, if you are willing to invest some time to help us with the
english documentation as Manual Team Lead or Contributor.

Please note: We are currently migrating the qgis wiki to the OSGeo server and to
mediawiki, that's why you will find more information about the new Manual
Writing process page already here: http://qgis.org/wiki/index.php/Manual_Writing

kind regards,
 Otto

Message-ID: <687455a70904180852r71abb183v5d9fd540307236f5@mail.gmail.com>

I have implemented basic HTTP authentication for the QGIS WMS provider
and am looking for some volunteers to test it. The changes have not
been committed to the QGIS SVN repository. Testing will require
compiling from source.

When creating or editing a WMS connection in QGIS you can now specify
an optional username and password to be used with a protected WMS.
These are stored in your QGIS settings. If you don't want the password
stored you can leave it blank and be prompted for it at connection
time.

I haven't had time to prepare a set of patches but you can download
the source tree (20Mb) that includes the WMS authentication from:

   http://gisalaska.com/qgis_wms_auth.zip

I am particularly interested in testing by folks that require a proxy.

Hi,

Is there is any work underway to add graphic primitives (circles,
rectangles, polygons, polylines) to map composer?

If no, than one of our developers is willing to invest some time into
it.

Any thoughts?

Maxim

Spatialite *is* working! :)
What we miss now is a SL manager, much in the style of Martin's PostGIS
Manager. Looks a reasonably easy task, with lots of potential...
All the best.

Dear all (espectially translators)

Could I invite you all to update your translations in trunk? On thursday
night (23 April 2009) I would like to branch for the release of QGIS 1.1
'Pan'. Our code base should now be string frozen and only critical bug
fixes and translation work should go into trunk until the 23rd.

After the 23rd when I have branched for Pan, general hacking can resume
in trunk and the Pan branch should not have anything committed to it
unless it relates to packaging.

I will be putting out a call for packages on the 23rd and will wait
until the 4th of May before making the QGIS Pan release announcement.

Pan has many new features and goodies so its sure to be a crowd pleaser!

Best regards

Hi,

In the ts files (at least in the Polish one) all <numerusform> translations has 
been damaged:

    <message numerus="yes">
        <source>Found %n matching feature(s).</source>
        <comment>test result</comment>
        <translation type="unfinished">
            <numerusform>Znaleziono %n pasuj?cych obiekt?w.
        
        </numerusform>
            <numerusform></numerusform>
            <numerusform></numerusform>
        </translation>
    </message>

As you see, 
1. translation status has been changed from finished to unfinished
2. two new empty lines has been added after the singular form
3. both plural forms was removed.

I don't know when it was broken (no time for analysing svn logs this night), but 
definitely one of us has a weird lupdate ;) I remember there was the same 
problem in the past year.

Can other language translators confirm this problem?

Looks like that happend back in r10444.  There all ts language tags were
removed from the ts files there and therefore all numerusforms - as
there number is language specific - were removed then or in subsequent
lupdate runs.  I also like to know how that happened.

To potentially avoid other problems, we've seen with the ts files and
Qt4.5, I ran update_ts_files.sh with lupdate from Qt 4.5rc1 yesterday.
After that I readded the language tags.  Thinking of it now, before
would have made more sense, if the numerusform would have been still
intact.  But at least for the polish translation, that wasn't the case.

I also noticed in the past that line references (ie. locations) come and
go - leading to huge changesets with just little, but harder to identify
actual change.

Probably it's best if translation commiters would look at the diffs
before commiting, try to investigate why they are seeing such
systematically changes, if the do. And in doubt ask for help here.

Sorry for the overly slow response. Tim is correct, we have talked about 
adding some of this functionality the core classes but it does not fit 
currently in the raster frame work, which still needs to be rethought 
for version 2.x.

As many filtering, reprojecting, clipping, raster arithmetic etc 
procedures change or create new data, it is best to create new layers 
for the output. So having this broader functionality in an analysis 
library make a lot of sense, especially since many routines will be 
working on multiple layers. Nonetheless, there will be opportunities to 
add some functionality, maybe accessors to blocks of data for example, 
to the existing raster class.

So what is really needed is a road map of desired manipulations and 
their inputs. Then we start to see what is needed and where it would be 
best implemented. That and about 20 more hours in a day.

Dear List,

I need some help, i am stucked with building Tim Sutton's tutorial1  
with qt. Do you have any idea about the solution?

I am trying to build Tim's first tutorial about qgis mapcanvas api on  
macosx leopard with qtcreator ide, I have qgis1.0.0 installed.

- the tutorial has been checked out from the svn.
- Q_OBJECT is in the headers.

It's working with cmake, if I copy the following libs in the build  
directory.
libgdal.1.dylib		libgeotiff.1.dylib	libjpeg.62.dylib	libqgis_core. 
1.0.dylib	libxerces-c.28.dylib
libgeos.3.dylib		libgif.4.dylib		libpq.5.dylib		libqgis_gui.1.0.dylib
libgeos_c.1.dylib	libjasper.1.dylib	libproj.0.dylib		libtiff.3.dylib

If not, it gives error:

Perhaps the problem is that the qmake can't find the libs? They are  
added to the .pro file, and they are in the g++ make command also.

Below you can find my .pro file and the build message. I have a lot of  
undefined symbols an I don't know why.


What does these undefined symbols mean? I haven't included a lib?
Undefined symbols:
"QgsVectorLayer::select(int, bool)", referenced from:
QgsVectorLayer::qt_metacall(QMetaObject::Call, int, void**)in  
moc_qgsvectorlayer.o
QgsVectorLayer::qt_metacall(QMetaObject::Call, int, void**)in  
moc_qgsvectorlayer.o....

Thanks for your help in advance!

Best wishes!

Maybe you've forgotten to initialize QGIS libraries:
QgsApplication::setPrefixPath( "path_to_qgis", true );
QgsApplication::initQgis();

if you don't initialize the libs or specify incorrect path, you won't
be able to load vector layers.

Btw. I think that with Qt even on windows one should use forward
slashes ( / ) instead of backslashes ( \ ) when writing paths.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS GRASS shell patch
Message-ID: <49F0150C.3090008@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Lorenzo Masini, a young dev here at Faunalia, has worked on porting the
GRASS shell of the plugin from Qt3 to Qt4, with some improvements:
http://int.faunalia.it/~paolo/grass-shell.patch.tar.gz
Work is still in progress, and a few things are missing:
- progress bar
- resizing of the shell
- cut/paste via keyboard shortcuts
But it should be working, and should solve also several other
shell-related bugs (please note that currently the grass shell is barely
usable). It *should* work also on win (untested).
Before going too far, I would appreciate if you could revise the patch
for its eventual inclusion in trunk. If ok, Lorenzo could add the
missing functions, presumably today.
All the best, an thanks.

update the sections of the "Coding and Installation Guide".

Hi all.
The patch has been upgraded. It now includes all what was missing,
excluded the progress bar (which does not appear very useful to me).
Please test it, and if you do not have major objections we could include
it in trunk (either before branching 1.1 or after, as the release
manager will decide).
I think the improvements are quite large (eg autocompletion, copy/paste,
etc.), and the patch finally removes any Qt3 code from QGIS.
Looking forward for comments.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Vector Layer Translate Feature
Message-ID: <200904231625.09308.pietro.panzeri@treuropa.com>

Hi all,

I'm writing a Python plugin to allow the user to translate a whole vector 
layer by a given shift.

I use the translateFeature() of the QgsVectorLayer class but if the layer is 
zoomed the function translates only the visualized features.

I use the following code:

vlayer = iface.activeLayer()

provider = vlayer.dataProvider()
attrs = provider.attributeIndexes()
provider.select(attrs)

f = QgsFeature()

while provider.nextFeature(f):
        error_code = vlayer.translateFeature(f.id(), delta_x, delta_y)


If the feature to translate is not one of the visualized features, the 
error_code is 1 and the feature is not translated.


I already posted this question on the users mailing list and they pointed me 
to this one.

Can someone point me a way to act on the whole layer regardless of the current 
zoom?

Thank you very much.

Pietro

Subject: [Qgis-developer] python plugin translations
Message-ID: <20090423144343.GA28458@norbit.de>

Hi there,

I found that the translation strings in the python plugins (namely
fTools) were incomplete.

In r10633 I added a loop to update_ts_files.sh that runs pylupdate4 over
each plugin and translates the resulting .ts file to C to replace the
handcrafted i18n.cpp files (the original i18n.cpps are still in the
repository).

I already updated the german translation accordingly.  What about the
others?

I asked briefly on IRC the other day if there was a "how to" for
including translation strings in a plugin, but no one seemed to know of
such a thing. I'd like to allow for translation of my plugin but I'm not
sure where to start.

Any hints,
Alex

I already informed Leonardo offlist that we are in feature freeze and
asked him not to commit anything until after we branch. At the time I
didnt notice that the module name looks bogus. Leonardo is this a
genuine module? If not please remove before 12pm GMT tonight.

Thanks

Yes, we realized this. Pity, hopefully we'll have a 1.2 soon :)
Or maybe, if it will be good enough, we could backport it for 1.1.1 or so.
Anyway, let's have the module working, and then it's up to you to decide
when and how to integrate it.
All the best.

No plans to make further changes. For 1.2 I plan to update the build
guide for win + vcexpress to use the new simpler osgeo4w deps approach.
Please go ahead for now.

Its a pity - especially given what a great effort the translators have
been making - but I would like to proceed with the release - the next
opportunity I will have to do it otherwise will be early may.

I'l be happy to do a 1.1.1 (cool version number he?) soon after 1.1 with
translation updates only.

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

Note: Its the first time I'm doing this - two releases in one go - if
people prefer them to be more spread out, please give me your feedback
and I will adjust the process next time.

- --- Note to casual readers ---
Please do not pre-announce this release - give the packagers and release
team a chance to do their thing so that people hearing about the release
have a fair chance of finding a package, reading all our press material etc.
- --- End note ---

Today I have branched for release both stable and trunk. It would be
great if you can assist by making packages for your preferred platform.
The branches can be checked out at:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_1_0 qgis-1.1.0
svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_0_2 qgis-1.0.2

Source tarballs can be obtained from here:

http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.1.0.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.1.0.tar.gz.md5

and

http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.0.2.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.0.2.tar.gz.md5


Please do not commit anything to the branch except packaging related
tweaks. Source packages will be made available shortly. The release
checklist at :

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist1.1.0

Has a list of people who have previously made packages. If you make a
package please be so kind as to send me an email with details of where I
can download the package. Please make sure the package is wgettable
since I do not have the bandwidth to first download all packages to my
home pc and then up again to the download server.

If you are able to make packages for unlisted platforms / distros please
let me know so that we can avoid duplication of effort.

I would like to make the release announcement around the 4th or 5th May
2009, so it will be great to have as many packages as possible ready by
then.

SVN Unstable (Trunk) is open again for general commits - please seek
guidance from Marco Hugentobler (PSC Code Manager) if you are planning
any major code changes.

SVN Stable (the 1.0.x branch) is open for minor tweaks and bug fixes
only. No new features should be added without prior consultation with
the developer list (but your request to add a new feature will probably
be refused).

Please note that we are aiming to do the next unstable (QGIS 1.2.0)
release within two months or so (timetable to be determined) and you
should not make any major feature changes without prior discussion with
PSC and Dev list.

Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS a reality.


Lastly can I call on the release team to put together visual changelog,
press announcements etc. ready for the release date? I will send you an
email when the packages are ready and you can start broadcasting
announcements.


Best regards

Hi:
    I?ve been doing some work to compile the user guide using windows. I made a small guide to setup all the neccessary tools.

My questions are where is the best place to ask about user documentation?, can I place the guide to build the manual in windows in documentation svn trunk? and where to post problems that I have found?

Hi:



I want to ask about the ogr drivers that are going to be included in Pan and
Kore releases?



Also if there are any plans to bundle ogr oci, ogr sde, gdal sde, gdal oci,
gdal ecw, gdal jpeg2000 jasper and gdal mrsid.



I`ve seen other opensource projects like ms4w bundling those drivers as
deactivated gdal plugins and providing instructions to activate the drivers and
instructions of how and where to obtain the sdks and dlls for those people
interested. Is possible to do this with Qgis?.

Hi, 
I'm not sure if it makes any sense because I'm extremely sleepy, but here is 
what I've just written to Maxim. Note that I never did it, but it should work.

------------------------------------

There are two different approaches:

A. For external plugins, you can translate them 'locally': all the translation 
stuff is inside the plugin directory and it links to qgis in the runtime. It 
doesn't affect the main qgis .ts files, so the plugin maintainer has to keep an 
eye on the translations and ask the translators.

Unfortunately I didn't ever try it.  At the time there is one plugin 
implementing such internalization. It's Horst's Geoprocessing. Use the code as 
an example. In general, you need to:

1) Pass all strings through the QCoreApplication.translate("context","text") 
static method. Maybe you can use just self.tr("text") instead, but I'm not sure 
whether it works in this case - it may be not able to pass the strings to the 
application. Please pay attention for a text context. It's very hard for 
translators to deal with text with enigmatic context. Usually the context is 
just the name of the class where the string is used. So it's very important to 
give classes a 'translator-friendly' ;) names, like "QgsReprojectRasterDialog" 
instead of just a "Dialog".

2) Create a .pro file and run pylupdate, which catches all the tr() parameters 
from both .py and .ui files (given in the .pro file) and create all the local 
.ts files. Translate the .ts files and compile them to .qm

3) Init and connect the QTranslator() object - look at the begining of Horst's 
geoprocessing.py file.



B. For 'internal' plugins, like fTools placed in svn, it's much simpler. You 
just need to use the self.tr() or QCoreApplication.translate() methods in .py 
files. All such strings in .py and .ui will be catched by the 
qgis/update_ts_files.sh script and put to the main qgis .ts files.

Thanks, that's the answer I as looking for.
I'm going to get some friends started on translating the Metadata editor
while I work on new features.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Setup.exe for offline install
Message-ID: <20090424102815.72b3ca6b@thoe.hq.intevation.de>

Dear QGIS-devs,

I would like to install several Win32-computer with a current
windows-version of QGIS, but, no Internet is available.

IS there still a standalone Windows-package available? I only found the
osgeo4w-packages[1].

Another option would be to take a copy of the whole osgeo4w-tree and
copy that locally to install from there (which is only a workaround
though).

TIA for any pointers

Best

on spacedman's qgis blog he shows a way to do offline install with osgeo4w:

Hi Tim and others,

I have a big favor to ask:

Yesterday I posted a problem with slow project loading for the
QGIS/Postgis combination. At least a handful of other users are having
similar issues.

See thread starting at:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2009-April/005182.html

It is a real problem, for me and others. Maybe we can solve it by changing
something in the Postgis datastructure - but maybe it is also a more
serious issue in QGIS that can be solved before releasing QGIS 1.1.

I wonder if you could wait with packaging until we have more information
on what the issue is here. J?rgen and Paolo are partially looking into the
issue with me. I would really appreciate if we could get a QGIS 1.1
release that would load my QGIS/Postgis project a lot faster than it does
today.

Thanks a lot,
Andreas

Hi all.
I noticed that in:

latest ubuntu is not listed, whereas it is available in the repo. Could
you please update the page?
Also, it seems that ubuntu qgis is compiled against a very old GRASS
version (6.2.3?). Would it be possible to update this?
All the best, and thanks.

It should be tested on windows and on osx, for which it will probably

Please test it and give us feedback.
We will be happy to commit it when ready.

Hi.

I have been trying to use your tips to render dynamic data (AIS tracks,
probably the same objective as Chee Kiang Lim).

So as to do so, here is what I have done so far:
In a plugin, I have subclassed the MapCanvasItem (in fact, I have used a
renamed VertexMarker class). This subclass is named CustomMapCanvasItem.
I have created a QThread subclass (CustomMapCanvasItemThread), which moves
the CustomMapCanvasItem it received in reference every 500ms (that is, it
setCenter() on the item, then updatePosition()).

Here is my problem:
When I create 1 of those items, everything works fine. With a map loaded, I
can see the Item moving around every 500ms.
But when I create 10 of those items (and consequently 10 threads), I can see
them moving but qgis crashes randomly (between 1 and 10 seconds max).
I suspect this is because there is no synchronization in the access to the
Item data when the thread moves the item.
I have tried to freeze the MapCanvas before updating the position... but it
doesn't work either.

Wonder:
If my explanations are clear enough, can you help me?
Can you detail a little bit further how you would do such a thing for a
large amount of tracks (let's say 5000...).
If there is a need for synchronization, how can I synchronize the access to
the items that I have to add to the MapCanvas (which doesn't synchronize
before using the data apparently.)

Thanks a lot.
Florian

Hi there,

I'm also having trouble with the example given above. The error message I
got is:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#3>", line 1, in <module>
    import qgis.core
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.

I have installed python 2.5.2 in C:\Python25 and Qgis 1.0 installed from the
package OSGeo4W in the default dir C:\OSGeo4W.

The environment variables are set as below:

PATH = C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis;%PATH%
PYTHONPATH = C:\OSGeo4W\apps\python25\lib\site-packages
QGISHOME = C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis

I also tried to add to the path variable the following dirs:
C:\OSGeo4W\bin; C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis\bin

but still no result.

I would really appreciate any help!

Many thanks in advance,

Ervin

Double check that you're using OSGeo4W's python and nothing from the one
in C:\Python25.

Upgrade to 1.0.1, almost all plugins were updated to work with the 1.0.x version.

Don't forget to delete the .qgis in your home (in document and settings
under windows) to delete all the old pluguins and configurations of the
0.9 version

Subject: [Qgis-developer] python: which symbol for classified feature
Message-ID: <49F376C8.10503@duif.net>

Hi devs,

I'm trying to determine the symbol for a feature when a layers is 
classified in one way or another, using the python interface.

If I'm correct, I can ask a renderer for it's symbols (via symbols()), 
returning me a List of symbols used, but I cannot myself determine, 
given a feature with which symbol it's (going to be) associated.

Looking at some cpp code, I find a protected member symbolForFeature.

Should I use that one? And if possible can this be made public via the 
python interface?

Or am I on the wrong track anyway, and should I ask another class for 
the color and pen of a certain classified feature?

TIA & Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] saveAsImage() in printcomposer
Message-ID: <49F38057.8020107@duif.net>


I stumbled upon this wish of a user:

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1528

This user wants to use the HtmlImageMaplugin based on a printcomposition 
build in composer. That is with a legend, scalebar and possible 
annotations etc

The plugin itself is not very complex: rip an image of current canvas, 
and html-ify the active layer.

Question now: can I do the same for the printcomposer (can't find a 
'saveAsImage()' around there :-)
It's not clear to me if I should paint the different composer-items one 
by one myself, or that I can take the 'ground-paint-device' and "...copy 
the  saveAsImage from the qgsmapcanvas...and make it public via the 
python interface....) (though those are pretty big steps for me anyway...).

Can somebody shed some light on this?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Two Questions about the QGIS API
Message-ID: <006f01c9c68d$7e502600$6401a8c0@cs41617>

I have been starting to work with Python plugins and have encountered two
methods that don't seem to work and wondered if someone could help me to
understand what is happening?

In the QgsMapCanvas class there are two methods that I am having trouble
with:

zoomWithCenter - when I use the input coordinates that I type the view moves
to some strange location. For instance the current view is centered roughly
at: 330616E,6058767 and when I put in the coordinates 329946,6058707 in the
call to this method it moves roughly to the coordinates 603170,1047099.
Maybe I don't understand how I should call this method?

zoomByFactor: the documentation states: "Factor > 1 zooms in" however when I
call this with 0 < Factor < 1 it actually zooms in. When I call it with
Factor > 1 it zooms out. Is this an error in the documentation?

thanks,
            Bob Bruce

My source and dev binaries folders were last backed up in Dec, so I

Message-ID: <49F53D7B.1070502@wildintellect.com>

I think I'm most of the way to getting a translation done on the
metaedit plugin(added some other features too) but I wanted to check on
how QGIS knows to load a particular language. Do I have to add code to
my plugin or will simply having the .qm files and the .pro file do it?

Also is there any way to test alternate languages in qgis without
modifying the computer's locale setting. ie: a menu or an api call via
python console that would just switch the language? maybe a command line
option?

Preliminary instructions on how to translate a plugin
https://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/qgismetaedit/wiki/Translations

Anyone know the German words for key(or tag) and value, like a python
dictionary or in this case an xml element and it's value.

Thanks,

Hi Pietro

This is probably a bug in the editing code of vector layer. I think it only checks the cached geometries (in view) and not the other ones. Please fill a bug into the tracker and assign it to me.

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Vector Layer Translate Feature
 
Hi all,

I'm writing a Python plugin to allow the user to translate a whole vector 
layer by a given shift.

I use the translateFeature() of the QgsVectorLayer class but if the layer is 
zoomed the function translates only the visualized features.

I use the following code:

vlayer = iface.activeLayer()

provider = vlayer.dataProvider()
attrs = provider.attributeIndexes()
provider.select(attrs)

f = QgsFeature()

while provider.nextFeature(f):
        error_code = vlayer.translateFeature(f.id(), delta_x, delta_y)


If the feature to translate is not one of the visualized features, the 
error_code is 1 and the feature is not translated.


I already posted this question on the users mailing list and they pointed me 
to this one.

Can someone point me a way to act on the whole layer regardless of the current 
zoom?

Thank you very much.

Pietro

Hi J?rgen,

Thanks for your reply, but I don't get your idea. Do you mean that I have to
include into the path variable only the C:\OSGeo4W dir?
Please explain more (if you can)

I had once a similar problem and I noticed that if pyhton is already
installed this interferes with the osgeo4w installation.

I removed it, installed what I needed via osgeo4w, including python,
than re-installed pyhton and all worked fine. I don't know if there is a
simpler workaround.

Hi Werner

I'm looking very much forward to the hackfest, thank you for organizing it.
The date in october overlaps with the FOSS4G conference in Australia (www.foss4g.org), so I'd vote for the first week of November.

Just wait a few more days for comments from the mailing list...

I'm not sure I understand you properly. As I've written, you need to set a 
QTranslator in your code. In Geoprocessing Plugin, Horst did it in that way: 

    userPluginPath = 
QFileInfo(QgsApplication.qgisUserDbFilePath()).path()+"/python/plugins/geoprocessing"
    systemPluginPath = 
QgsApplication.prefixPath()+"/share/qgis/python/plugins/geoprocessing"
    myLocaleName = QLocale.system().name()
    myLocale = myLocaleName[0:2]

    if QFileInfo(userPluginPath).exists():
      pluginPath = userPluginPath+"/i18n/geoprocessing_"+myLocale+".qm"
    elif QFileInfo(systemPluginPath).exists():
      pluginPath = systemPluginPath+"/i18n/geoprocessing_"+myLocale+".qm"

    self.localePath = pluginPath
    self.translator = QTranslator()
    self.translator.load(self.localePath)


Of course you need also to use the QCoreApplication.translate(context,string) 
for every translated string.

The .pro file is ONLY for creating/updating the .ts files with pylupdate4. Then 
you can compile the files to .qm with lrelease-qt4.

You need to either run qgis with a paramater --lang , e.g. qgis --lang de
or set it in the Options dialog and restart qgis

Hi again!

As Marco reminded me that FOSS4G is on that Weekend i'd like to give two 
new possible dates ..

(29.) 30.Oct - 1.(2.)Nov 2009 (The so called "Halloween-Hackfest")
(5.) 6.Nov - 8. (9.) Nov 2009

I'd update the wiki site with news as soon as I can ..

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/index.php/2._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Vienna_2009

As soon as I have a fixed date I keep you informed about accomodation 
and other interesting things on this page

So who can give me a go for which weekende?

That's exactly the information I needed. Based on it I made a generic
function that will work for any plugins who want to implement
translations. All you need to do is call the function in your plugin
init passing it the self object, plugin path(which I do dynamically),
and the name of your plugin directory.
http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/qgismetaedit/browser/trunk/translate.py

Translation files need to be in a i18n(number 18) folder and labeled
like pluginname_de.ts
http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/qgismetaedit/wiki/Translations

I played with the --lang option which is great but it doesn't apply to
plugins. Specifically looking at main.cpp
"
myTranslationCode = QLocale::system().name();
464    //setting the locale/userLocale when the --lang= option is not
set will allow third party
465    //plugins to always use the same locale as the QGIS, otherwise
they can be out of sync
466    mySettings.setValue( "locale/userLocale", myTranslationCode );"

I was wondering if the mySettings is available via the python api so
that it can be checked by my new function. In fact changing the setting
in QGIS doesn't work either for plugins(Horst's or mine) since we don't
know how to detect the QGIS setting and only rely on the system setting
for now.

Last, anyone have a list of language codes to use. Maybe what qt expects
or what people.

Thanks,
Alex

PS: If you run a German login you can test our metaedit translation,
requires svn checkout for now.

Hi All,
I am using Qgis 1.0.0 in ubuntu 8.04.Actually after loading a Raster layer
when i try to select
change co-ordinate Reference system (CRS)in project properties it shows only
three i.e
Geographic co-ordinate system
Projected co-ordinate system
User defined co-ordinate system
Actually it should show lot of other CRS also like WGS 84 etc..
Can any body suggest me what could be the problem.

Thanks in advance.

Hello devs,

I am currently updating the OGC-related chapters of the manual for the
new release.

Support for authentication has been implemented for WMS (which works),
but the dialog is identical also for WFS.

Is this known to work with secured WFS-servers? I do not have one at
hand currently.

Please drop me a line if this is workable and should be mentioned in
the manual as well.

TIA

Best

Yes, it's very simple to use:

settings = QSettings()
if settings.value("locale/overrideFlag").toBool():
  myLocale = settings.value("locale/userLocale").toString()
else:
  myLocale = ... # give the system settings

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposal: relative paths for SVG point symbols
Message-ID: <57222.193.246.86.39.1240910079.squirrel@webmail.carto.net>

Hi,

I would like to propose that SVG symbol references in the QGIS project
file aren't stored with absolute paths, but with relative paths.

This is very important in a Multi-OS environment (mixed
Windows/Linux/MacOSX).

I assume that QGIS knows where the SVG symbol directory resides, e.g. in
/usr/local/share/qgis/svg on Linux or in C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis\svg on
Windows.

I also propose that QGIS automagically replaces backslashes with slashes
or vice/versa in the paths, depending on the platform it runs on.

The goal should be a QGIS project file that can freely be moved around
platforms, only pointing to network resources, such as Postgis database,
WMS/WFS, etc. where there is no need for absolute paths.

If you also think that this is useful, I'd like to open a feature request
in the bug-tracker.

Thanks,
Andreas

Message-ID: <41262.193.246.86.39.1240910792.squirrel@webmail.carto.net>

Hi,

J?rgen just provided a useful enhancement which speeds up project loading
when complex Postgis Views/Tables are involved. It solved my issue where a
project previously loaded in 3-4 minutes and after the enhancement it
loads in 10 seconds.

I would like to ask if this can still be merged into the 1.1 release, even
after the branch from the SVN trunk. This is very important. I am not the
only one suffering from the bad performance when loading project files
with complex Postgis tables/views. At least 2-3 other persons also
reported that this is an issue for them.

I think this is worth investing the extra work required for reviewing this
enhancement and merging this into the 1.1 official release.

See the thread starting at
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2009-April/005182.html for more
information.

Thanks for your consideration and best wishes,
Andreas

You will need to expand one of the above tree items to view the CRS 
under them... to do this, click the + symbol and select the CRS you want 
(you will have to know whether it is a Geographic, Projected, or User 
defined CRS). You can also use the search tools to help you find the CRS 
you are looking for...

Hi,
Thanks for your reply.
But that expand option(+) is not there which means there might be some other
problem .I am not getting what could be the problem.I checked all the
settings.

plz give me any suggestion.

Unrelated to the PostGIS question, we also have projects that take many
minutes to load. This is apparently due to rather large (hundreds of Mb)
jpeg orthophoto. Any idea of what to check?

That was the last little magic piece, now it works for all 3 ways:
QGIS Setting
Command Line --lang option
or System Locale

I noticed that the current setup doesn't allow for temporary override of
a QGIS setting, it rather changes it, but thats a minor issue for later.

Here's my code for use in other plugins
http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/qgismetaedit/browser/trunk/translate.py
This might be something good to roll into QGIS and made available via
the api so that all plugins can trigger translations if they want
without a whole new copy of the code.

In your main plugin file you need something like
import os.path
from translate import localeSwitch
currentPath = os.path.dirname(__file__)

class MetaEditPlugin:
    def __init__(self,iface):
        self.iface = iface
        try:
            self.QgisVersion = unicode( QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT )
            # Apply translation if appropirate
            localeSwitch(self,currentPath,"metaedit")

I think I put it off since I don't actually write c++ or commit to the

It appears so, at least on Linux (Ubuntu 8.10) but testing on my friends
windows box (OSGEO4W) setup, neither QGIS Setting or Command Line work
right, basic qt words in the main .qm files translate but not anything
from the custom. I haven't done any python debugging on win yet to see
what's going on.

I'd appreciate someone else trying it out. Currently it's in the svn
trunk for metaedit on sourceforge, but should be in the contrib repo in
a day or 2 as I'm rolling out a bunch of other fixes/improvements too.

Thanks,

GRASS opening the toolbox give a /grass/config/default.qgc not found.
Hence module List etc are missing.
(I'm guessing I missed something in the grass-plugin build)
-Tried both libgdal1-dev 1.6.0-1 and libgdal1-dev 1.5.4-2
-These are working fine in my repo pulled versions of qgis
-tried with GRASS 6.3 and custom 6.4

Spatialite works but fails to detect geometry type in all tests
including the example database provided from spatialite's website.

*.db is also a common extension for sqlite, works fine if all files is
selected and a .db sqlite file is picked.

Why is spatialite on the file menu instead of the database menu. It's
not more or less of a database than the ESRI personal geodatabase(also a
single file)?

Just some notes as I work my way through, same issues with trunk.
I think the grass stuff is a build error on my part, not sure how to
correct and the spatialite stuff are just things to work on, but not
holding me up at all.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi,
I have built rev. 10654 on Jaunty 32 bit (with grass 6.4rc4) and I'm
experiencing none of the referred problems.

Could you post your ccmake alterations you used to tell it which GRASS
and GDAL to use?

Thanks,

I think some files from older QGIS installation cause this problem.
Clean the installation directory and do 'make install' again.

I basically followed my own instructions 

http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Instalar_Grass_6.4_e_QGis_1.0_em_Ubuntu_8.10_(com_ECW_e_MrSID)

sorry, they are in Portuguese but code and commands should be pretty
clear. I just made the necessary changes to use the new grass RC and
qgis unstable instead of the stable source code.

I wish that were the case, but each of these attempts was installed to
it's own path.
/apps/qgis1.1
/apps/qgis-trunk
etc...

I also made sure to run make clean if reattempting and in some cases
completely removed build and started over.

Is it really necessary to use threads here? Usually much simpler
approach is to use a timer that updates the items once in a while. And
you don't have to worry about large number of threads and
synchronisation.

Yes, you have to synchronize the threads, otherwise you'll have
concurrency problems. Everything shared among threads must be accessed
safely, i.e. using mutexes, semaphores, r/w locks etc...

Hi Richard,

you might want to call renderer's renderFeature() method. This method
prepares painter for drawing of the feature based on the geometry
type:
- line - sets painter's pen
- polygon - sets painter's pen and brush
- point - modifies a QImage instance passed as an argument (will
contain the marker)

I'm not sure whether it will work with point symbols in python, the
interface is somehow messy. But for lines and polygons you should be
able to get the information you want from painter.

You should pass screen coordinates, not map coordinates to this
function. It's being used usually for the wheel event in map canvas.

You're right. Fixed in svn trunk (r10684).

OK, thanks. The dialog when adding new WFS-Layers implies this since
both username and password fields also appear there. Problably this was
not the intended behaviour?

Hi

Thanks for your answer.

My idea with the threads was to experiment. After browsing the QT API (of
which I am no expert at all), I suppose that what I want to do would take
great advantage of signals.
The way I see it:  Some QTcpSocket would send a signal when data is
received, another helper class would handle this data, and emit another
signal when a new track data is available. This signal would finally be used
to update the QgsMapCanvasItem data in QGis. This seems cool.

I understand very well your remarks about the synchronization. However,
since I am adding the items to the MapCanvas using the QGis API, and since
this API doesn't seem to provide any way to synchronize the access to the
items, I don't see how I could have the synchronization properly
implemented. I can add all the mutexes that I want in my code, the QGis API
won't synchronize...

Did I miss something? Is there an implicit synchronization in the Qt API
regarding the QGraphicScene?

Thanks for your help again.

The download page will be updated before I make the release  
announcement. With regards to GRASS we are dependent on whatever  
upstream GRASS makes it into Ubuntu.

I answered this previously, but just to make sure you saw my reply I  
will repeat it here. Since the 1.1 release is already in packaging  
process and made its way into some repos, we will have to release this  
as 1.1.1 which we can set in motion as soon as I return from Brasil on  
the 4th of May.


Until the 1.1 release is gone out the 1.1 branch should be frozen  
except for packaging related commits otherwise we will have confusion  
with some platforms having the fix and others not.

Hi


Maybe overlapping with FOSS4G actually could be a good thing -  I know  
they are planning a hackfest so we could perhaps have a three way  
virtual hackfest between US, Europe and Australia. It would be good  
also to liase with Aaron and others who were interested in  
participating from the US.

The sooner we can fix the dates, the sooner I can book my tickets and  
in theory the cheaper the flight will be....


regards


Tim

Yes we will probably need to follow this route - I would love to  
include these dll's by default but it looks like we may run into legal  
troubles if we do. We can try to one by one approach vendors and seek  
permission to include there dll's in out binary bundles - though I  
suspect this is not very GPL friendly so we may run into problems  
there...

No time machine eh? :-( I was wondering if the binaries built by your  
xcode project would be suitable for redistribution. I see that some  
deps are in the bundle (Qt, gsl, pg) but not others (gdal, geos. etc).  
Is this something you can easily tweak to correct?

My condolences on your hard drive crash. I am happy to wait a few days  
before announcing the release so that we can have a mac binary to go  
with the announcement.

I have backups, in various forms, using other software not time  
machine.  I don't backup the source folder often since it changes so  
often and is recoverable, except when I forget to save in-progress  
stuff elsewhere ;)

The Xcode project builds Qgis by default just like my usual binaries,  
with my frameworks an external requirement.  Specifically, dynamic  
libraries and Qt/PyQt are bundled.  So Tom could easily compile Qgis  
using all dynamic libraries and bundle them for his all-in-one Qgis.   
I haven't heard from Tom if he's tried it yet.

I had more backed up that I thought, so it wasn't too bad.  1.1 xcode  
build was easy to  do.  I want to try to bundle qwt5, but it doesn't  
seem to like SIP 4.8 dev.  I need to try qwt 5.2.

I'm not sure about 1.0.2.  I've gotten so used to the Xcode build for  
trunk/1.1 that I'm rusty on my scripts for packaging 1.0.  I'll see  
what I can do.

Hi All,
I am using qgis in ubuntu 8.04.
I have installed qgis 1st time from binaries for ubuntu 8.04.
But it didn't work properly in my machine.Then I did check out source code
from SVN and complied it .It worked .But by mistake i had not removed the
previously installed(binaries)qgis stuff .When i try to have different CRS
from properties it was not showing all the CRS which it should show.SO i
removed the 1st installed qgis by apt-get remove .
Still I am not getting those Co-ordinate Reference Systems.

I got fully stock here.
Can anyone please suggest me the proper solution with this regard.

ok - sorry - I must have missed your previous answer.

It is understandable that you cannot merge in changes after the branching
took place.

And thanks for considering a 1.1.1 release soon!

I have a similar opinion... is there actually anyone willing to
participate both at FOSS4G and QGIS hackfest and couldn't due the
collision of dates?

I don't understand what do you mean by saying "QGis API won't
synchronize" as QGIS API has nothing to do with it in this case.

There is no implicit synchronization. You have to make sure that the
graphics scene is not being used concurrently in more threads.

Hi all!

The same for me .. The sooner a decision for a date is made the sooner I 
can start working out a "real" program for hackfest ..
So anyone willing to make a decision?

It seems that the option with weekend from (22.) 23.Oct - (25.) 26. Oct 
is still open ..

Shall we do a vote for a date anywhere in the internet?

regards
Werner

Lorenzo,

Hopefully you can find a Mac system to test your work against. The new  
plugin has a serious regression where the keyboard inputs are being  
passed as keyboard shortcuts to the main app, so typing 'v' in the  
search field brings up the add vector dialog.

Here is the original bug report:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/739

Cheers,
John

For better planning I have opened a doodle poll. All hackfest
participants can insert their preferred dates. Perhaps this helps to
find a hackfest date.

With the following link you can contact the poll.

Hi all.
While cleaning up the bug queue, I find sometimes difficult to classify
bugs into one of the categories, eg the recent fTools bug should go to
plugins (it *is* a plugin bug) or to python (again, it *is* in python).
More generally, I think there are perhaps too many categories, and the
limits between them are sometimes ambiguous.
How about reclassifying them, reducing the number of cats?
All the best.

Hi all.
Could someone let me know what is the current state of
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/121 ?
Is there work going on? Is it a difficult function to implement?
The Carson plugin seems close to the desired function, would it be
difficult to extend it to have full functionality?
All the best, and many thanks.

Strictly speaking the above is only needed when you are granted SVN  
write access, but since you look like you will be heading that way  
soon its good that you have read the guidelines :-)

Welcome aboard!

Hi just to give due credit, the python version of the tutorial was

Subject: [Qgis-developer] synchronization function suggestion
Message-ID: <1027004666.20090430145513@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

Sometime ago we were stuggling with editing features within a layer. I'm not
talking about QgsVectorLayer methods that are already implemented and working fine,
but other basic geometry editing functions, that sometimes
require to store results in the same layer. Like clip, buffer etc.

The main problem is that, while methods that are already in API are
able to do that (lets take moveVertex for example), new ones should
work around to reflect changes without comitting.

So we want to propose to add a generic function to synchronize changed
geometries. This function might be useful for future
API extension or plugins, that will add functionality to work on
geometries within a layer. Something like:

bool QgsVectorLayer::updateFeature(QgsFeature &feat)
{
  mChangedGeometries[feat.id()]=*feat.geometry();
  setModified( true, true );
  return true;
}


Any thoughts?

Maxim

PS: this is from a conversation with our developer, so I might have
misinterpreted something, but it seems logical to me. We can work on
the implementation, if there are no objections.

Yes I also think simpler is always better - do you have a suggestion  
for a new classification?
