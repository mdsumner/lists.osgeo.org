+1

We really need to redesign some classes after 0.8 (and before 1.0). I agree 
fully with the mentioned points about vector and raster structures.

Talking about design questions, it would be nice to have a QPixmap free zone 
up to the level of maplayers and map rendering. This would be nice for custom 
applications which are using the qgis libraries and don't have access to the 
x-server (for instance server applications).

cheers,

Devs,

If you don't have handy access to Ruby and irb, you can use the

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Questions and suggestion on build setup
Message-ID: <25967F1C-FC1A-4F74-8854-E580A293344E@kyngchaos.com>

I was messing around with an Xcode project for Qgis and noticed a  
couple oddities in the build (this is with preview 2 source):

- projection selector is built as a library, and is not in the  
plugins or providers source folder, so it seems to be a core library  
for Qgis, yet it is installed in the plugins folder.  Shouldn't a  
library be kept with the rest of the libraries?  The grass provider  
library does.

- the scalebar plugin is the only one that has 'lib' prefixed to its  
name, and has mixed case:

libScaleBarplugin


Also, a suggestion for the Mac app packaging - organize it more Mac- 
like in the package.  Something like:

Contents
     Frameworks
         qgis libs
         Qt frameworks
         other bundled shared libs
     Headers
     MacOS
         qgis
         qgis_config
         qgis_help.app
     PlugIns
         qgis plugins
         qt plugins
     Resources
         all share/qgis stuff

The plugins is an odd one, because 'plugins' is the name of the Qt  
plugins folder, and 'PlugIns' is the standard OSX plugins folder  
name.  Qt plugins I think needs to be in the samme place relative to  
the qt frameworks, but I don't know for sure, and there is probably  
some way to set that at runtime.  On a normal OSX file system, the  
case difference in the name shouldn't be a problem, but it would be  
on a case-sensitive HFS+ or UFS disk.

The only changes needed are the resources and plugins path functions,  
and in the help app for locating the help data.


PS. Xcode project is almost done, I'll turn it loose later in the week.

I think it was an experiment in creating a Qt custom widget. From the 
viewpoint of Qt Designer and the development process, it's somewhat like 
a UI plugin. At runtime, however, it's essential to have the widget 
present; it's not optional but could perhaps be replaced by an alternate 
implementation.

We seem to have three classes of extras: Qt widgets, QGIS providers and 
QGIS plugins. Implementations of the first are required, the third are 
optional and I'm not fully sure about the second. Some providers are 
optional but would QGIS work without the OGR provider?

Some extras are more important that others and perhaps should be sorted 
into different folders for QGIS 1.0. As a product in development, 
however, some of these distinctions are still fuzzy. Tim periodically 
lobbies for greater use of UI widgets; when we implement more, we may 
get a better feel for where they belong. For now, I have no objection to 
the projection selector being installed in either place.

libwfsprovider also has the prefix but is not mixed case. My preference 
is not to include 'lib' if 'plugin' or 'provider' is part of the name.

A related oddity is that most qgis libs have version 1.0.0 while raster 
and msexport have version 0.0.0.

Personally, I like using the same paths as *nix so that changes made by 
a *nix developer are likely to work on a Mac with no extra effort.

Most, maybe all, path names are encapsulated in accessor functions in 
the QgsApplication class. You can try reorganizing the directories 
yourself to see how feasible it is. If you get it working, you can give 
us the changes.

A related issue are the helper applications. If really going the Mac 
path route, they probably should be in a 'Utilities' folder alongside 
QGIS rather then inside the bundle, especially apps like msexport, 
gridmaker and spit.

Also, Qt 4.2 is now available as a dmg file so you might want to try 
that as well. (Look in the 'previous versions' link which is actually 
the complete Qt distribution directory.)

I'm more interested in rearranging dialog boxes (Qt 4.2 does support Mac 
ordering of OK and Cancel buttons) than bundle directories but you 
should feel free to try this yourself.

Makes more sense.  I didn't notice about wfs provider - preview 2  
didn't enable that by default, so I skipped it.

I found where Qgis initializes the Qt plugin path if Qt frameworks  
are embedded.  So I can adjust this as necessary (I put them in with  
Qgis plugins for now in my experiment).

I found those.  But the 'same paths as nix' is countered in these  
because they have #ifdefs for whether it's a nix, mac or win build.   
I was able to change these with no trouble.

Except that, if they link to Qgis libraries in the Qgis app, that's a  
bad thing to do.  But don't those (havn't built msexport yet) build  
as plugins?  At one time they may have built as executable variants,  
I recall seeing these once, maybe in 0.7.

I'm starting the Xcode thing with the preview 2 source for now - can  
that build with Qt 4.2 as is?  Once I get the bulk of the Xcode  
project settled (actually, almost done), I'll switch over to SVN  
source and Qt 4.2.

One big plus with Xcode is that a universal build is super easy.  And  
the app bundle packaging is automatic.

Hi

This error is not in qgis sources (from what I can see). I would fist
suggest trying to distclean and rebuild.

Message-ID: <d368056f0612050513r1a606597md5c0894038779109@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGIS / Grass gurus

I've made a fix for the 'spaces in paths' issue with launching the
grass shell. A new snapshot build is available at:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/qgis_setup.exe

The new snapshot is also built with qt 4.2.2 (probably only of
interest to version geeks :-)

Could the grass gurus please test and see if the shell behaves
properly (runs grass commands ok etc)

Thanks

Hi.
I cannot print line layers to Postscript/Pdf.  drawPolyline is called,
but no lines are is written (I tried to diff files). It works on screen
and when printing to raster image.

Can you confirm this problem?

No. With your and Martin's recent fixes I'm now able to print to pdf,
ps and eps! Hooray! And lines are rendered OK.

The only glitch still remaining for me, which I also have mentioned in
the #345 in Trac, is that although the "Print to file" is checked by
default, the dialog for entering the path to file is not active;
printers are listed instead; see the attached screenshot.

I have to uncheck it and check it back for the path dialog to become
active.

Right - the more I play around with designer plugins the more eager I
get to make the qgis gui a bunch of widgets. From my use of designer
widgets in other projects, this has two big benifits:

1) third party application developers can drop ready to use components
e.g. symbology widget into their application
2) we can improve code reuse and maintenance e.g. all places in teh
app that use a outline style selector can share common code and a
common gui part

Post 1.0 I plan to really go through the qgis UI stuff and try to
componentise as much as possible.

Yes this should really be standardsied with the other plugins.

Thats an oversight - they can be bumped up to match the rest of qgis I think

The link to the 'previous versions' (actually all versions) directory is 
on line 17 of the Qt/Mac download page:
http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/mac

The link target is:
ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/

The current Mac dmg is:
ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/qt-mac-opensource-4.2.2.dmg

The quality seems to be closer to RC than final which may be why they 
don't advertise it.

It will place files in the following directories:
/Developer/Applications/Qt/
/Developer/Documentation/Qt/
/Developer/Examples/Qt/
/Developer/Tools/Qt/
/Developer/Tools/uninstall-qt.py
/Library/Frameworks/Qt*
/usr/bin/findtr,lrelease,lupdate,moc,qmake,qt3to4,rcc,uic,uic3
/usr/include/QtUiTools/
/usr/lib/libQtUiTools.a
/usr/local/Qt4.2/

After installation, I needed to change QT_EDITION_UNKNOWN to 
QT_EDITION_OPENSOURCE in 
/Library/Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Headers/qconfig.h to get anything 
to compile.

It created the symbolic link /usr/local/Qt4.2/mkspecs/default pointing 
to macx-xcode. I changed it to macx-g++ which is what the Qt source 
build creates. I think this only matters for qmake.

Yes, known bug in Qt. I presume that printing to file is more frequent
then printing to printer, but until they fix it in Qt it will be better to
use printer as default. I'll change it.

Hi Martin,

I have a question regarding the spatial indexing. Do you use it additionally 
to the indexing on the provider level or just for providers which do not 
offer indexing (but AFAIK most do)?

I implemented spatial indexing in the WFS provider using the geos library. 
They provide STR tree (modified R-Tree) and Quadtree. It would be interesting 
to know about the pros and cons of geos compared to spatial indexing library.

cheers,
Marco

Hi Marco,

currently spatial indexing is just a feature that no other part of
QGIS uses (so far).  But I have a long-time vision of offering some
functionality for provider if it doesn't support that natively:
- fast spatial lookup - using spatial indexing
- filtering features by attributes - using search strings
- fast feature retreiving - by caching of features in memory
- maybe also fast attribute searching - using B-trees or similar

Of course PostGIS or GRASS can do all or most of them, but e.g. OGR
has only limited support for this and some providers doesn't support
such things at all. With this we could enforce creation of new
interesting providers and allowing them good performance.

I took a look at STR tree in geos, but I must say I wasn't very happy
with it. Cons:
- lack of documentation and quite hard to find information about STR
trees anywhere
- supports only intersection query
- unable to insert/delete/modify it once built
- supports storing index only in memory
- I haven't studied the code to details but it looks like that it's
using only vertical slices for indexing instead of using regions (?)

Thus R-tree is winner for me - it's much more flexible. But it might
be interesting to compare the performance of the stuctures.

Nice! A fast feature access by id will allow us to have a smarter attribute 
table which fetches attributes when needed.

Do you have a timeline in mind for those implementations? If you need help, I 
think I could add with coding work.

No, I have no timeline for this - it's been always a just part of the
bigger vision of conquering the world :-) In real we're not far away.
We have backends for spatial indexing and attribute filtering, just we
need to enable them for a provider in a manner that it could be used
easily.

Caching features is something I've not thought much about, so any
design ideas or coding would be most welcome. I'd like to see it
flexible, but not too complicated. User-customizable memory amount
(let's say 50 mb by default) could be used to cache the features, and
features can be removed from the cache using "least recently used"
strategy...

Attribute indexing is not that crucial for now, but it could help in
some cases - e.g. attribute filtering or searcing in attribute table,
maybe in future for joining tables etc.

I still have a related problem with SVN 6195, but slightly different.

When I start QGIS the default filetype in print composer is PDF. I set
up a map, specify a path to an EPS file - then I get the infamous
errors: "cannot find boundingbox" and "cannot find translate". But, if
I let QGIS print to PDF once, from then on printing to *any* format
becomes possible in the current session - be it PDF, PS or EPS. What
the devil?

That's better now, thanks.

Moreover I noticed map composer works way faster now, and the artifact
lines when rendering polygons are gone. Great!

Pardon the brevity, tired brain.

Xcode project for Xcode 2.4.  Universal build.  Use SVN source + Qt  
4.2.  Configuration in the project settings.  More could be automated  
in the future.  Use my frameworks for handy universal base (default  
settings).  For now, all optional stuff is required, even stuff like  
GRASS and Postgres and GSL (actually, I'm not sure what is required  
and what is optional).

A few customized source files to handle internal reorganization of  
the app bundle to make more sense in a Mac app.

See readme for full gorey details.  Questions? Ask.

Xcode project and companion binary on my Qgis download page.

Hi Tim,
thanks great work!

I have checked the grass modules with the grass-test-suite.
The result is available here:
http://www-pool.math.tu-berlin.de/~soeren/grass/GRASS_TestSuite/html_win32/

Here are some screenshots of the qgis-grass shell with some test-suite run results:

http://www-pool.math.tu-berlin.de/~soeren/grass/modules/screenshots/Qgis_0_8_Grass_6_3_Mingw_TestSuite_raster.png

Most of the modules are working well, only r3.info seems to have 
problems with windows.

Best regards
Soeren

Hi Soren

Thanks very much for the useful feedback. At this point I am still
using the grass modules from crosscompiled grass. Until I can get
grass to build natively under msys it will be difficult for me to
resolve these. Currently grass configure fails to find XDR rpc lib
even though I have sucessfully build and installed XDR.


I'll try to work something out for though....

Regards

Tim

Hi

I've uploaded a yet another new snapshot of QGIS for windows with
georeferencer plugin and issues with the uninstaller not removing all
files fixed. The installer also places the toolbars in a (hopefully)
sensible layout on machines where qgis is being installed for the
first time.

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/qgis_setup.exe

No changes have been made relating to grass issues etc yet. Anybody
who is able to test the georeferencer plugin and provide feedback will
have their comments greatfully received.

HI Markus

Ill need to get back in to work to check on my linux box what version
is in the chroot for cross compiling. The current version of grass in
the windows build is just translocated binaries from that xcompiled
build set up by Radim - pending my ability to get grass to build
properly in msys. If a grass guru can help me get grass compiling in
our msys environment I would be happy to track the head version of
grass (or latest stable if you prefer) for the future releases.
Currently when I run configure I get:

checking for library containing cuserid... no
checking for xdrmem_create... no
checking for xdrmem_create in -lsun... no
checking for xdrmem_create in -lnsl... no
checking for xdrmem_create in -lrpclib... no
checking for xdrmem_create in -lxdr... no
configure: error: *** Unable to locate XDR functions.

I configured using:

./configure --build=i686-pc-mingw32 \
        --without-curses \
        --without-jpeg \
        --without-tiff \
        --without-png \
        --without-tcltk \
        --without-postgres \
        --without-mysql \
        --without-sqlite \
        --without-opengl \
        --without-odbc \
        --without-fftw \
        --without-blas \
        --without-lapack \
        --without-motif \
        --without-freetype \
        --without-glw \
        --without-nls \
        --without-readline \
        --without-opendwg \
        --without-x

I have xdr installed in the msys environment here:

cria@NOTE3 /src/xdr-4.0-mingw2
$ make install
Creating RPC header directory
mkdir -p /usr/local/include/rpc && \
        chmod 755 /usr/local/include/rpc
Installing XDR header files
set -x;for i in rpc/types.h rpc/xdr.h ; do \
        (install -c -m 644 $i /usr/local/include/rpc) done
+ install -c -m 644 rpc/types.h /usr/local/include/rpc
+ install -c -m 644 rpc/xdr.h /usr/local/include/rpc
Installing XDR library
install -c -m 644 libxdr.a /usr/local/lib
ranlib /usr/local/lib/libxdr.a

Any hints would be greatly appreciated. The msys environment can be
downloaded at

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/msys.tar.bz2

If any grass gurus want to give it a go I would be most greatful for
the help. Because I havent uploaded my latest local copy of the msys
environment, note that grass needs to be updated from cvs there and
you may need to grab xdr from

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingWindowsBinaryOnLinux?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=xdr-4.0-mingw2.tar.gz

Hi Tim,

looking at my notes from the time I've been trying to build grass with
mingw, I've found out that I had similar problem and I think that this
has helped:

./configure  (... usual options ...) --with-includes=/usr/include
--with-libs=/usr/lib

I guess that you'll need to use /usr/local prefix instead of just /usr

Hope that helps,
Martin

Hi all.
Just discovered (thanks Cinzia!) an exceedingly interesting feature,
allowing the definition of selective transparencies in qgis:

How hard would it be to implement this (generating the vrt file on the

All the best.

Hi devs,

I just noted that under windows, the GML reading with OGR does not work. I 
suppose that the gdal of the windows version wasn't compiled with xerces 
support. We probably should disable the GML entry in the file selection 
dialog for windows (or compile with xerxes-support for windows, but I know 
this can be a pain...).

Greetings,
Marco

Hi Paolo

Yes thats cool. I think it should not be too difficult to do to
integrate this type of functionality into the raster properties
dialog.....

No need to ask for feature requests, just add them - we can always
reject them later if you ask the impossible :-P

Regards

Hi to all!

I think that would be nice to add in the Sponsorship Page, information about how works on QGIS are going;
For example, we can use the Roadmap bar from Trac
( https://svn.qgis.org/trac/roadmap ).

What do you think about?

Bye

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS Unit Tests for Win Build
Message-ID: <d368056f0612110720l478333u8fa4b177d1f55ef2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Soren

Could you run your unit tests again? Freddy build GRASS natively under
msys and Ive included that in the currently available setup.exe
snapshot build. It would be good to know if the issues are resolved
there and if any new ones have taken their place.

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,
i have tried to run the grass test suite within the msys environment.
But the tests failed for many modules, because the library 
libgrass_gproj.6.3.cvs.dll was not found.

The test suite depends on g.region, g.remove, g.parser
 and some other grass modules. 
So the test suite is not fully independent from grass. :( 
i.e: g.region is called for each unit and integration test.

Maybe this lib was not copied to the lib dir?

Best regards
Soeren

The library is in the top-level directory where qgis is installed  
(this is true for the latest test build). Try adding your qgis  
install directory to the path and then testing.

Will be Qt 4.2.2 the minimum requirement to build Qgis?

I hope it will be 4.2 as discussed on the list:

Hi,
i made it. :)

I have copied the gproj, site and vect lib to the grass lib directory
to run the test suite.

The result is available here:
http://www-pool.math.tu-berlin.de/~soeren/grass/GRASS_TestSuite/html_win32_msys/

It is quite similiar to the qgis-grass-build result:
http://www-pool.math.tu-berlin.de/~soeren/grass/GRASS_TestSuite/html_win32/

Best regards

I mean in the list/report/query with more tickets, especially in
custom query. If 'Must fix' is more important than Priority
it should be displayed in query.

You can easily create your own custom query that includes it:

status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&group=milestone&must_fix=Yes& 
milestone=Version+0.8+Release&order=priority

I think this is a difficult situation: not having enough development 
force even if the money (small as it may be) is there is a double (maybe 
triple, if we consider the somewhat reasonable position of Maciek) 
frustration. Releasing a (too) buggy version is bad, waiting any longer 
is ugly, frustrating donors is unwise.
I believe the current strategy is probably the best we can do about: 
release as soon as possible, when *all* critical bugs (we have 7 now), 
and as many as possible among the major ones (N=15) are fixed.
Also, some of the bugs do not appear hard to fix (eg 286, 310), or have 
been introduced by recent commits (eg 444, 445), so it should not be too 
heavy to revert them.
Perhaps bug bounty strategy would be a more sensible way of investing 
the funds we have? Would some of the current devs would be interested in 
participating to he hunt?
All the best.

Hi there,

I started to write down some of my ideas regarding the design of a (hopefully) 
clearer and simpler data model (one word or two???). Please check the wki 
page at http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Redesign_of_QGis_data_model and chime 
in with any ideas or comments.

Since my knowledge with rasters and tins is rather limited, I'm especially 
interested in comments from the folks who are expert in that area.

cheers,
Christoph

Hello all,



I am new in QGIS. I have been tried to compile QGIS v.0.8 preview (I was 
getting

source codes from https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis SVN 
repository)

on Windows platform using MS Visual C++ 2005. In first time I have got lot

of compiler errors then I was getting Mr. Mateusz Loskot's help. But I have

still new compiler errors. 
I have got strange error please look at: 

-----------------------------

qgis_gui.lib(qgisiface.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol

"public: virtual struct QMetaObject const * __thiscall

QgisIface::metaObject(void)const "

(?metaObject at QgisIface@@UBEPBUQMetaObject@@XZ)

-----------------------------



Please help me, what's wrong in my compilation process? 



I hope that you will help to me.





Best regards,

	jinzhg

Hi,

it looks like you've forgotten to run MOC for QgisIface (or forgot to
add the moc-ed file to compilation). If you don't have a big reason
for using MSVC I suggest you to use MinGW for compiling QGIS on
windows.

Martin

Hi Chris

I had a read through and added a few requirements. Nice work - I'm
looking forward to seeing these kind of improvements in qgis.

Hi,

I must say - nice analysis! I always prefer to do code cleanups and
refactorings sooner than later - I've learned that on one project
where I've been only adding new features without refining design,
ending with completely unmaintainable code.

I've read the wiki page and I have some questions:

- vector data queries: you differentiate between queries for geometry
and queries for select operation. Do you think it's better? Have you
considered that when drawing you might need also some attributes e.g.
to determine feature's color?

My vision of queries is that you'll call something like:
select(QgsRect spatialFilter, QgsSearchString attributeFilter)
so you'll specify both spatial and attribute filter at once and
getNextFeature() calls will give you features that pass through both
filters.

For even better flexibility we might use visitor design pattern, e.g.:
select(QgsDataVisitor* visitor, QgsRect spatialFilter, QgsSearchString
attributeFilter)
Usage: you'll create a subclass of QgsDataVisitor and override its
function which gets called on new feature. This way you could decide
what to do or data it will need most flexibly.

- you write that data sets should be subclassed by provider
developers. I don't understand this - I thought you mean that
providers will do low-level backend-dependent work, while datasets
will provide high-level (provider independent) functionality... Why to
subclass them?

- it's not clear to me what type of connection will be between map
layers and data sets - do you think of one-to-one or also other types
e.g. one dataset for more layers?

- when interfacing layer, should I be able to get direct access to
data set or data provider? Or should layer work as a proxy for some
functionality of these classes?

If you'll have some time it would be nice to have an UML diagram with
only layer, data set and data provider classes, their connection and
most important functions / member values.

My questions here are mostly about vector layers, I'm not very
comfortable with all the raster stuff. Probably Tim is the one who
could understands QGIS raster drawing the most

Dear jin,

What kind of line styles do you mean exactly? The Qt library supports a bit=
=20
more than we export in the QGIS user interface (see=20
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/qpen.html), but from a cartographer point of=20
view it is still very limited.

So the resolution of the problem is to start coding in qgis (or even qt) to=
=20
support more line styles. If you intend to do so, please inform the develop=
er=20
mailing list about what you are doing to avoid conflicts with other changes=
=20
to the code.

cheers,

hi Marco:
thanks for reply,
i am a new QGISer,
in fact,i am work in the cartographer field.
in this  field,sometimes i have to draw some lines with styles
like highline,roadline,....and i will apply a tool

that is my goal.
If you will  do so

If you are building yourself you need to enable the section with
debug_and_release in settings.pro. If you are using the setup from the
testbuilds dir on qgis.org, you need to get the debug version from
there. I think Gary has not uploaded a debug version with the last
snapshot he made.

Gary can you build and upload the debug version?

Regards

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Patch for compiling qgis-0.8pre2 with geos-3.0.0rc3
Message-ID: <BAY102-DAV108316D6294983D58499ECBCCB0@phx.gbl>

Hello list,

I understand that getting QGIS to work with upcoming GEOS 3.x library is 
not currently a priority for the project.

However, for those that want to update their GEOS library and still have 
a working QGIS installation, I have updated a patch from Mateusz Loskot 
for making QGIS 0.8 prerelease 2 compile successfully against the GEOS 
3.x library.  It just needed a couple fixes to work with the second 
prerelease (i.e., removing some additional 'geos::' qualifiers in 
qgsgeometry.cpp).

I can probably also make another patch with the some additional fixes 
that I made in an attempt to get the current qgis_unstable (revision 
6266) branch to compile.  As far as I can tell, it seems to be working 
(for the GEOS part).  However, the compile fails (around what I suspect 
to be the end of the process) with the following errors:

make[2]: Entering directory `/home/sources/qgis_unstable/i18n'
cd ..; /bin/sh ./create_qm_files.sh
Creating qmake project file
./create_qm_files.sh: line 12: /usr/bin/qmake: No such file or directory

make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/sources/qgis_unstable'
make: *** [all] Error 2

Does this make sense to anyone?  Could there be some missing files from 
the svn repository?

Regards,
Mike

Sorry, it is 3.x only.  With my very limited understanding of c++ 
programming, I can only guess if it's even possible to allow compiling 
against both 2.x and 3.x.  I only made a few changes to what Mateusz 
Loskot had already done get things going for me.  I tried allowing it to 
compile against 2.x in the configure script after applying the patch, 
and it doesn't like it the missing 'geos::' qualifier for the geos 
classes.  So I figured that for now this is just useful for anyone that 
really needs/wants to use GEOS 3.x along with QGIS, and as reference for 
when QGIS.

Other than tinkering with the stuff related to geos, nothing I've done 
different from what I did with prerelease 2 (i.e., the configure options 
and environment are identical).  Here are the options I used:

./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64 --with-qtdir=/usr 
--with-python --with-gdal=/usr/bin/gdal-config 
--with-geos=/usr/bin/geos-config --with-projdir=/usr 
--with-sqlite3dir=/usr --with-postgresql=/usr/bin 
--with-grass=/usr/grass-6.2.0 --with-gsl-prefix=/usr

My qmake and lrelease binaries for qt4 are located in 
/usr/lib64/qt4/bin.  Is there something I need to do to tell it to look 
there?

Regards,
Mike

I see several possibilities here:

One is to add the following to each file with removed namespace prefixes.

#if GEOS_VERSION_MAJOR < 3
using namespace geos;
#endif

This is ok for cpp files but not a good idea for h files because it can 
result in name collisions in unexpected places if the h file is widely 
included.

Another idea is to change our prefixes from "geos" to "GEOS" or 
something similar if "GEOS" is already in use and then add the following 
after figuring out what the new namespace is:

#if GEOS_VERSION_MAJOR < 3
#define GEOS geos
#else
#define GEOS geos3whatever
#endif

This technique avoids having headers propagate the "using" clause into 
unexpected places.

Your changes to what geos headers to include may also need a bit of 
adjustment to work with both 2 and 3.

I have not installed GEOS 3 because I thought that the API had changed 
and code needed to be revised. Your patches seem to indicate that 
existing code probably still works and just the namespace has changed.

I will install GEOS 3 and try this myself. Thanks for doing the research.

Ok,

For some reason, adding /usr/lib64/qt4/bin to the path didn't do the 
trick...I actually had to add a links to qmake and lrelease /usr/bin as 
Gavin suggested.  It just seems strange that prerelase 2 had no problems 
for me like this, but now the current version does...

FWIW, I've attached a patch for the current unstable source with the 
extra changes I needed to get it to work with GEOS 3.x.  This took a 
couple more changes to get working.  I had to include references to 
TopologyException.h in qgsgeometry.cpp and qgsogrprovider.cpp, and make 
a couple changes to the catch statements that used the TopologyException 
class.

Also, it seems I still needed to add a symbolic link to the new geos 
library for it to compile like so:

ln -s /usr/lib64/libgeos-3.0.0rc3.so /usr/lib64/libgeos.so.2

Anyway, I hope somebody finds this useful.

Regards,
Mike

Actually, I think this was just because I still had some of the

The following seems to be a method for compiling QGIS using either GEOS 
2 or 3.

1. Do not change any includes; retain "#include <geos.h>"

2. After the include of geos.h in qgsgeometry.h and qgsogrprovider.h, add:

#if GEOS_VERSION_MAJOR < 3
#define GEOS_GEOM geos
#define GEOS_IO geos
#define GEOS_UTIL geos
#else
#define GEOS_GEOM geos::geom
#define GEOS_IO geos::io
#define GEOS_UTIL geos::util
#endif

3. Change all "geos::" in cpp files to the appropriate "GEOS_WHATEVER::"

4. Add "#if GEOS_VERSION_MAJOR < 3" code variations for any renamed methods.

I have tried this only for the ogr directory so far. I found one renamed 
  method. It compiles for both GEOS 2 and 3.

The work now is to find the new prefix for each of the geos prefixes in 
core.

Hi Jin,

No, QGIS is crossplattform and must run under Linux, Windows and OS X. So M=
=46C=20
is not a good idea. QGIS uses the Qt library from Trolltech=20
(www.trolltech.com) for user interface and graphics.

Ok, that method seems to work well.  Here's yet another patch in which I 
applied your approach.  I generated it from revision 6268 of the the 
qgis_unstable branch.  With these changes, it compiled and ran for me 
with both geos 2.2.3 and geos 3.0.0rc3.  I'm not sure if it's perfectly 
clean (e.g., I'm not fully sure which geos *.h files really need to be 
included in the *.cpp and/or *.h files for things like qgsgeometry and 
qgsogrprovider), but what's in the patch seems to be working with no 
trouble.

Message-ID: <340505ef0612170627l162604bfibc447697e051c7bb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.
Where can I find step by step instructions how to build QGIS on Windows?
I have downloaded http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/msys.tar.bz2
but there is no qgis in this package.
Then there is http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/qgis-qmake-files.zip
but how to use that?

Hi Radim,

msys.tar.bz2 is only prepared environment for compilation. Information
on how to compile qgis is in file README_windows.txt in SVN trunk.
Archive qgis-qmake-files.zip contains source changes needed for
compilation - more details are in that readme.

Hi.
Anybody has idea where messages printed to stderr/stdout go on Windows
if qgis is compiled without debug? I can see messages if the application
is started from MSYS but no messages are printed if it is started from
explorer, batch file or cmd.exe.

Radim,

AFAIK, there is no difference between stderr/stdout in debug and
release. By default, in C and C++, stderr is bound to stdout, and stdout
is a console. So, if you run program by double-click from the explorer,
then stdout/stderr messeges are not printed.

Cheers

I am trying to fix https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/448
and I found that the problem is that it is not possible to duplicate
stdin/stdout. So it seems there is no stdout/stdin at all.
GRASS lib:
     if ( (stdin_orig  = _dup(_fileno(stdin ))) == -1  ||
         (stdout_orig = _dup(_fileno(stdout))) == -1 )
    {
        db_syserror ("can't duplicate stdin/stdout");
        return (dbDriver *) NULL;
    }
The same build of QGIS however has stdout/stdin open if it
is run from MSYS.
Anybody has idea how to get QGIS running without command
window but with stdout/stdin open (pointing to '/dev/null' for example)?

The problem is obviously in GRASS but I am not sure if we can fix that
within a week.

I have fixed https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/448
but the patch must be applied to GRASS. So I left it open
until the GRASS which will be used to build official QGIS binaries
for windows is patched.

We should let people know that this patch must be applied.
Where should I add a warning? In README_windows.txt?

Hi

Yes - unless you are happy to use grass cvs head for the qgis release
and the patch is already in grass? If you want to use latest stable
only, I will update the msys.tar.bz2 file to the tagged grass stable
release and then apply the patch in the generally downloadable msys
tarball....?

I think that QGIS shloud use GRASS stable release, but I am not
sure if there are some important fixes missing in the last stable 6.2.1.
For now stick with HEAD (currently 6.3.-cvs) where the patch was applied
(it should become future stable 6.4.0) I asked also to apply the patch
in 6.2 branch (it will be in the next stable 6.2.2).

Please close the ticket once you update GRASS from CVS in msys.tar.bz2.

Still there is the problem with (sometimes, according how qgis was compiled
and started) flashing console when GRASS db driver is started.
Anybody knows how to suppress console on Windows for a program
run by spawnl() which must be started with stdin/stdout?

Hi.
Would it be possible to have also an owner 'nobody' in trac?
There are several tickets assigned to me in trac which I am not going
to work on. Currently it is not clear if a defeloper to who the ticket
is assigned is realy working or willing to work on the ticket.
This can be confusing for others because they believe that ticket owner
is going to fix the ticket.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] gdal with gml support (windows)
Message-ID: <BAY110-W573C61494E828ED663C9DB2C90@phx.gbl>

Hi:
 
Finally (after a week) I have built gdal/ogr with gml support in Windows, here is a summary of what I got
in the compilation process:
1.-First of all, when using xerces-c 2.7 every program using gdal library crash during
starting time.
2.-Versions below 2.6 of xerces-c does not compile in mingw.
4.- When building gdal/ogr with xerces support I got this error:
iom_utilities.cpp:57: error: `void _searchenv(const char*, const char*, char*)' was declared `extern' and later `static'
 
_searchenv is a function provided by the MSVC library that finds
files which may be anywhere along a path which appears in an
environment variable.
but it seems like that function was already defined in xerces, so I commented the function in iom_utilities.cpp.
 
After that gdal was built with no problems, should I report this issue to gdal team?
 
Libraries and apps are available here: http://189.164.166.249/gdal.rar
 
 
Regards
 
Freddy

All components are now owned by "nobody". This means if a ticket is  
created and not assigned to anyone by the submitter, it will show an  
owner of "nobody".

Hi Martin,

Thanks for the feedback. Please see my attached comments. Also, feel free to 
make any chagnes to the wiki pages.

sure, I don't see why we can't combine feature and attribute queries.

not sure what the benefits here would be, but then I'm not familiar with this 
design pattern. I guess, I should read up on it.

Yes, it was the idea that datasets would be independant from the data 
provider. Yet, after some more thinking, I'm not sure if this would actually 
be possible, since the provider wouldn't deal with the individual 
featuers/cells but with the dataset as a whole.

The idea is that the same dataset could be used for mulitple layers. I didn't 
deal much with the layers yet, since I don't realy think they are part of the 
data model, but rather part of the UI (?) model. I only included them in the 
discussion as clearification/examples.

no. the layer wouldn't provide direct access to the data. You would need to 
get the underlaying dataset for a layer in order to interact with the data.

a more detailed UML should come in the next couple of weeks. I'm currently 
putting some thoughts into what methods and members each class should have 
and compare them to what already exists.

Hi

 I really have no expertise on this, so I look to your guidance on the
final decision...Its stll not clear to me from this discussion what
the concensus is.

I have not been following GRASS development for a while.
According to what Hamish wrote, there should be no fixes important
for QGIS in 6.3. I dont know exactly when releasebranch_6_2 was created
but it seems that in 28 August 2006. IIRC I sent some fixes after this date
but I am not sure. Both 6.3 and 6.2.1 have bugs but the problem
of 6.3 is that it is changing every day. It will be probably better to
use the stable release 6.2.1 + the last patch for start.c.
Maybe it will be necessary to add some other important patches,
maybe not. In fact, we have to create our stable version of GRASS
for QGIS/Win from 6.2.1.
Maybe it would be better to create a branch for it in CVS?
Or just a dir with patches in QGIS SVN?

Hi Paolo,

does it happen also with current SVN trunk? If so it would be good if
you could file a ticket for that and attach data, if possible provide
also backtrace.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis 0.8pre2 on suse10.2
Message-ID: <20061219211426.0a69aac8@localhost.localdomain>

Hi, 

I try to compile qgis pre2 on an opensuse 10.2 with qt4.2.1. QGIS doesn't
find the header files like qglobal.h under /usr/lib/qt4/include. They don't
exist and I don't know what further packages I need to install, because I
thinkt I already installed all qt4 rpms that come with the distribution.

Under download.qgis.org/qgis/ there is already a
qgis-0.8.0_preview-1_no_grass.i586.rpm for suse 10. Was this package built using
qt4 from suse or using compiled qt4 sources? 

Maybe someone knows a trick how to build the preview2 under suse 10.

thanks a lot
 Otto

Hello Otto,

Look for an rpm called something like qt4-devel for your distribution - 
the devel packages are what usually install the header files.

Hi, 

thanks for the hint, the devel packages were in /usr/include/Qt, so
export QTDIR=/usr works. 

Now I have another problem. SuSe 10.2 unfortunately doesn't include GEOS, so I
compiled and installed current GEOS-3.0.0rc3 and QGIS complains because it
expects a GEOS 2.x.x Version.

Where and what do I have to change to adapt the test? Or do I need to stick with
GEOS 2.x.x?

 thanks again
  Otto

Otto,

There is a patch posted on the developer list: 
http://lists.qgis.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2006-December/001218.html

This will let you compile QGIS 0.8 prerelease 2 with GEOS-3.0.0rc3 (but 
not 2.x).  There's another patch for the SVN unstable branch that allows 
compiling against either of 3.x/2.x in a follow-up message: 
http://lists.qgis.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2006-December/001227.html

I wouldn't say that these are officially approved patches, but it'll 
probably do the trick for you.

The patches are renamed to *.bin files in the archive, but it's still 
plain text, so I think you should be able to use them.

Regards,
Mike

Hi,

thanks a lot for your help I will try another time. For today I changed back to
stable geos 2.2.3 and it compiled without any problems. 

I finally created QGIS and related GIS rpm packages. If you like you can
download the software here:

RPM and SRPM:
http://www.nature-consult.de/software/suse/10.2/

best,
 Otto

Message-ID: <200612271916.20897.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Dear qgis devs,

I did a fix in the postgresprovider. Because release is so close, it would be 
good if postgis experts could have a look so that the fix doesn't cause other 
problems.

postgresprovider, l. 201

before: mUri.password = password.left(n-1);
now: mUri.password = password.left(n);

thanks,
Marco

Hi,
I stepped on problems when using non-Ascii characters and creating new 
Vector layers, both in file name (should be fixed now), but also in 
attributes and fields.

I think I have a solution - just need to test it :-) - is it to late to
check it into svn? I had to add a parameter to createEmptyDataSource().

The option to create shapefiles is also present in delimited text 
plugin, and I fixed it there previously. It would be good if this could 
also come into "New Vector Layer..."

Interesting - though it seems limited to only using dash patterns for
lines which is my problem with qt line styles too. I want to be able
to have more options e.g. for symbolising freeways etc on maps. Maybe
its there and I missed it in my speed reading...

It appears that you can have severla parallel lines in a pen, and with 
different distance perpendicular to the center. Perhaps that could be used?

Hi All

Are we still good to go ahead and tag svn as version 0.8.0 tonight?

Ive made a new windows snapshot here:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/qgis_setup_finalpreview.exe

for if anyone wants to have a last minute poke around...

If there are no objections, I will go ahead and tag tonight so we can
get on with our lives again.... :-)

Will there be a branch to work on bugfix, and a branch for 0.9?

Hi all.
Currently there are 23 bugs in 0.8:
https://svn.qgis.org/trac/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&milestone=Version+0.8+Release&order=priority
5 of them are critical, 9 are labelled "Must fix".
New bugs are appearing regularly (very roughly one per day).
Are we sure we want to release a "stable version"?
All the best.

Ah yes that could do it. The other tricky bit is to work out how to
get qt4 to draw them efficiently. I read up ont he qt linestyles
before today. You can create custom dash patterns but anything more
involved will probaly involve overpainting the same line several times
to get the desired effect.

You can find it at QGIS wiki at

Looks fine to me. None of my databases require passwords, so when I did
that bit of code the shortened password wouldn't of caused a problem.

Still, as there are mustfix bugs, why not releasing a beta, and waiting
another week or so (until these 7 bugs will have been squashed)?
We all want 0.8 to be released ASAP, but relasing a crashing version is
not very good.

Hi Lubos,
thanks for that.
I just want to note that plural forms are supported by Qt4, see documentation:
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/qobject.html#tr
However we don't use it so far in QGIS. It might be good to find the
places which need our attention to enable plural forms - I guess
translators know these places best :-)

This is always a hard decision when to release a 'stable' version.
IMHO current SVN trunk is much more stable than 0.7 release, because
also many bugs have been fixed that were present there.

Also waiting one or more weeks doesn't make much sense for me - I
guess there might be new bugs to squash and the same scenario might
repeat. I don't see anything incorrect in releasing now: every piece
of software has its bugs, most of the software is being released also
in case it still has known issues.

Your position may be correct, but:

remove it from the trac

Maybe Paolo's statement is quite radical, but I second him. Either-or.

... which will have it's own bunch of critical bugs due to new
features, thus the average stability of QGIS might remain not good
enough for deadline-driven usage.

I'm affraid the scenario suggested by Paolo is not that unlikely. I
realise how unconvenient it actually is to maintain 2 or more branches,
doubling your work for having to backport changes between them. Thus
the 0.8 branch is likely to be soon given up and all the effort moved
into 0.9. So 0.8 might remain unstable forever.

A valid point. How can I ask my colleagues to use software which I know
is not stable, and take the responsibility for delays and problems in
their proffessional work? Moreover, once they try QGIS which crashes on
them, they'll quit it and will not be that keen to try it again in
future. The first user's approach should be successful for QGIS to take
over on "other software". And the more successful take overs, the more
users, developers and sponsors.

Please don't get me wrong. I've been using QGIS and I'm gratefull for
it. I hope QGIS community recognizes my (humble) contributions too. I'm
only wishing QGIS all best, and I believe an unstable release is not
good for QGIS.

We will carry out bug fix releases in 0.8.1 etc. Releasing now will
free up developers to carry on with their work. I think its time to
follow the 'release early, release often' mantra which we have clearly
lost sight of in the pursuit of making a 'perfect' release.

Regarding the professional environment argument yes this is a concern
but in any normal case IT managers will evaluate new software and
decide whether they are happy to deploy in their environment. How many
businesses are using Internet Explorer 7.0 already? I think very few -
they wait for a few point releases and when they are happy with the
product they deploy it.

Lets get our momentum back, lets get back to having frequent releases
and stop being so concerned with version numbers. As soon as the
issues in the queue are resolved we can do 0.8.1 - even if its only a
few weeks. Lets get back to being a developer friendly environment
where people are able to make contributions again with out being stuck
in perpetual code freeze.

0.7 had 4 bug fix releases why would we treat 0.8 any differently?

At the moment we have some effort in bug fixing in almost no effort in
developing new features. Lets get the balance back and allow
developers to get on with their work again while at the same time
giving people who want to fix bugs can use qgis 0.8 as a base that we
can continue to stabilise. We did this in 0.7 and it worked well I
think.

As in my last post, the simple answer is 'dont'. Wait until you are
happy with the release (0.8.x or whatever) and then prompt them to
move. Same as you would do with any other software.


Moreover, once they try QGIS which crashes on
> them, they'll quit it and will not be that keen to try it again in

Dont give it to them to use until you are happy with the stability.
There is no universal rule that says you must deploy this on release.
There are many other people out there who will be grateful to have a
new release and make use of the new features in QGIS even if there are
still a few bugs. Its up to you to choose...it is 'free' software
afterall.

In an ideal world I will agree that putting something unstable out
there is not good. In an ideal world I would also say that > 1 year
between software releases is not good. But we need to be pragmatic and
realise that making qgis 100% foolproof could easily take many more
months. In the meantime we lose many advantages that the open source
rapid release cycle offers.

In summary if you are not happy with the quality of 0.8 just hang for
0.8.1. Look at the maths:

svn trunk + XX months or weeks == very stable release
0.8 +  XX months or weeks = very stable release

It takes you the same time to have a stable release on your desktop
and in the second scenario people who are not interested in bug fixing
are able to get on with other work.

Tim

Hi Martin,
thanks for the tip. It's nice feature which has been added recently in Qt 4.2. 
I've tested it a little and it works really great (at least for Slovak plural 
forms :-) ). My experiments resulted in patch (filed as ticket #502).

And I'll have a Mac OS X universal based on my frameworks, on my

The tarball seems to be damaged.  Direct download is 7.7 MB, and both  
StuffIt Expander and Apple BOMArchiver don't get past the un-gzipping.

There are no seeds yet for the torrent, so I can't try that, but the  
size it reports is 7.08 MB.

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly  
what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly  
disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely  
inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has  
already happened.

Same problem here on a Gentoo Linux x86 machine. The ebuild I wrote
works fine but launching qgis fails with the reported lines.

I haven't the slightest idea of what can be done to fix this.

Cheers.

you can find the QGIS 0.8.0 packages for SuSE 10.2 here:

http://www.nature-consult.de/software/suse/10.2/
http://www.nature-consult.de/software/suse/10.2/SRPM/

BTW: I guess, there is a test for python 2.5 missing, which is used in SuSE
10.2. So I am not sure, wether python is included or not because it is just

Stupid question:

How do I check out this in svn, and should we check in bug fixes in this

All 0.8 bug fixes should be committed to the branch. We will have to  
merge fixes into HEAD if they are relevant to the 0.9 version.

I just noticed that the qgsgps_plugin.qrc.cpp source is missing.   
That could cause make to fail to link the plugin.

I've updated the tarball and SVN commits have been made to address  
these issues. Tested and compiled here....

You can determine if it is included by running the mapserver export  
tool from the QGIS File menu.

Packages for Debian Testing i386 are available at this apt 
repository:

http://debian.gfoss.it/

It seems that GPS plugin is working, msexport is compiled and 
packaged, wfs, wms and Grass plugin too.

I attach the debian files that I had to change respect the ones 
downloaded from https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/debian

Complete instructions on compiling and packaging are in the 
repository README.


Happy new year!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mac OS X vertex limitation
Message-ID: <A3AF2D8C-BCE8-40FB-A7D1-CD1B0158BFC0@kyngchaos.com>

There's a note in the Mac Qgis readme about the Mac build being  
limited in the number of vertices per polygon due to a QuickTime  
limitation (actually that's a QuickDraw limitation) as used in Qt.   
Is this still valid?

I looked at the Qt docs for QPainter and Qt4 should be able to use  
OSX's CoreGraphics now.  Unless maybe Qgis is still using a Qt3  
compatibility thing and stuck on the QuickDraw method?  Though I'm  
not sure if CoreGraphics has removed that vertex limitation or not  
(one would think so).

I'm not sure, maybe Tom knows...

We aren't using Qt3 compat for drawing so this shouldn't be an issue.  
I can easily test with my dataset once there is a Mac build available.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Windows native GRASS build
Message-ID: <d368056f0612311945y46bf36cs96720ba9db44fa1d@mail.gmail.com>

Happy new year all!

For those of you following the GRASS on windows efforts with QGIS, I
have now got GRASS building with all but about 20 modules under
msys/windows. I havent compiled in postgresql support yet.. GRASS
attribute viewing and man page viewing are now working under windows
qgis for me. There are two small issues remaining that I noticed (and
maybe more that others will notice):

1) Every time a layer is added a black console box temporarily appears
and then disappears.
2) When clicking on a tool inthe GRASS toolbox, I get a message like:
   "Warning: cannot find key output"
3) Are any of the unbuilt modules listed below particularly vital to
have in the QGIS 0.8 binary installer for windows?

I will upload a binary for testing tonight or tomorrow.

I compiled with the following options:

./configure --build=i686-pc-mingw32 \
            --with-jpeg-libs=/bin \
            --with-libs=/local/lib/ \
            --with-png-libs=/bin \
            --with-fftw-libs=/local/lib \
            --with-fftw-includes=/local/include \
            --with-includes=/local/include \
            --with-includes=/include \
            --with-tcltk=no \
            --with-postgres=no \
            --with-opengl=no

And the end of make report looks like this:
