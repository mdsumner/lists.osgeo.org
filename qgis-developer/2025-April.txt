Subject: [QGIS-Developer] reopen pull request, chat group

Hello,

I sent this already to qgis-developer-request at lists.osgeo.org, I guess 
it was not read.

Is it correct that I cannot reopen a pull request? I had force pushed 
the branch after closing, but force pushed again with the hash of the 
latest manual commit before closing following this instruction

https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/2c42c15f1ce6dab03a0675348edd4e2c

There was another auto-fix commit after, but I was not able to push the 
hash (bad object).

So, could someone with the needed rights reopen the PR? thanks!

*Error in loading sld-style for interval parameter of markerline #24954 
#61165*

I did not see that I can convert the PR to a draft, next time I will do 
that to stop people from reviewing, sorry. If it is preferred I will 
just open a new PR.


On another note, is there currently some sort of chat group specifically 
for development? I see that the last message on the #coredev chat on 
revolt is from 2022.

thanks and
best wishes,
Moritz Hackenberg

Hi Moritz,

I'm not a QGIS developer, but I keep seeing this happen in other projects. Contributors are just told to file a new PR, so don't worry about it.

As for the chat, there's a Matrix room, but it's more user-oriented and not very active. At least some of the developers might hang in there, though.

Laurentiu

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Choosing shape tool in Digitizing Toolbar crashed
 QGIS
Message-ID: <b3856a5ab82047e9b7eedba466f2d897@erdc.dren.mil>

Any idea how to track this issue?  Does not indicate any lines in my code.  Happens after I click on Rectangle from Extent in the Shape Digitizing Toolbar.  My code automatically triggers the Add Polygon Feature in the Digitizing Toolbar and Selects Digitize with Segment so that the user can choose to just digitize a polygon segment as the default drawing.  Plus selecting Add Polygon Feature is what enables the Digitizing Toolbar so they can also they can choose to draw Rectangle from Extent.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Compiling QGIS with Debug: error with pdal_wrench
 and gdal_fwd.h
Message-ID: <32a04c81-bd58-44ee-adc6-e9a760d83339@di.uminho.pt>

Hi devs,

I'm not able to compile QGIS with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug. No problem 
to build QGIS with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release.

I think this happens since the change in GDAL's gdal_fwd.h to support:

#if defined(GDAL_DEBUG)
/** Opaque type for a spatial reference system */
typedef struct OGRSpatialReferenceHS *OGRSpatialReferenceH;
/** Opaque type for a coordinate transformation object */
typedef struct OGRCoordinateTransformationHS *OGRCoordinateTransformationH;
#else
/** Opaque type for a spatial reference system */
typedef void *OGRSpatialReferenceH;
/** Opaque type for a coordinate transformation object */
typedef void *OGRCoordinateTransformationH;
#endif

The error I'm getting is:

-DQWT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/qwt-6.2.0/include/ 
-DWITH_CUSTOM_WIDGETS=TRUE ../QGIS

I'm using GDAL and PDAL built from master.

Any clues about the best way to avoid this error?

Hi,

Did you find something related to plugin settings ?

I'm fine to update the docs if there are some hints.
https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/settings.html
Or maybe better in the PyQGIS doc straight ?

Hi,

I realize now that it's not documented for Python yet.
There is a show description in the developer guidelines:
https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/developers_guide/codingstandards.html#settings

The important bits are to correctly create and remove the settings node for
your plugin and to have only one instance of the node!
It might be easier with a real example for now:

https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-swiss-locator/blob/a21df5587b59e1f1f56762e26022441ed5b5db3d/swiss_locator/swiss_locator_plugin.py#L105
https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-swiss-locator/blob/master/swiss_locator/core/settings.py

I'll try to make the docs up to date in the future!

Denis

That should not happen but we cannot help unless you share code that 
reproduces this behaviour ;)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Python Versions
Message-ID: <aae72c66-5ca6-43b5-94a4-edd7de82fe63@bgeo.es>

Hi devs,

I was wondering, is there a rule for which python version comes with 
each QGIS version?

It would be very useful for developing plugins, because I thought that 
from QGIS 3.34 onwards it comes with Python 3.12. But I installed 
qgis-ltr (3.40.5) on debian and saw that it came with Python 3.11.

Is there a minimum Python version that all plugins should use? We've 
been using new syntax added on newer versions of Python thinking that if 
the latest QGIS release comes with a certain Python version, I could 
assume that my plugin (if I only want to support the last two LTR) must 
work with that python version.

To summarize:
- In my Windows machine, I have both QGIS 3.40.4 & 3.34.15 and they both 
come with Python 3.12, therefore I assumed our plugin could use Python 
3.12 syntax and features.
- In a Debian machine, I installed QGIS 3.40.5 and it came with Python 
3.11.2.

It's not the end of the world for our plugin, because the most 
significant change we made was the usage of `match`, which was 
introduced in Python 3.10. But still, I don't really know if some user 
might have the latest release still with Python 3.9.

That's why I'm asking, what guidelines should I follow?

Thank you very much!

No.  qgis is in general built from source, and will support multiple
versions, from some minimum to some max.  Each binary package
constructed from those sources will use a particular version.

It is therefore not meaningful to say that a version of qgis comes with
a specific python version.

Presumably Debian 12, and operating system distributions tend to stay at
the python version they started with.  Python moves a bit too quickly.

In the qgis sources, look at CMakeLists and see what the minimum python
version is.   Stick to that.  Really; it's that simple.

Those are two data points and that does not establish that there could
not reasonably be a build of 3.40 with 3.10.  There are lots of "Laggard
Term Stable" distributions out there and they tend to have older
versions of ~everything in base.

It might be that 3.40's CMakeLists specifies 3.10 as minimum.

Here's your answer.  For 3.40, python could be as early as 3.9.  Fro
3.34, it could be 3.7.  Even for the master branch, it could be 3.9.

$ for i in 34 36 38 40 42; do git checkout release-3_$i; echo 3_$i; egrep 'MIN_PYTHON_VERSION ' CMakeLists.txt ; done

3_34
set(MIN_PYTHON_VERSION "3.7")

3_36
set(MIN_PYTHON_VERSION "3.7")

3_38
set(MIN_PYTHON_VERSION "3.7")

3_40
set(MIN_PYTHON_VERSION "3.9")

3_42
set(MIN_PYTHON_VERSION "3.9")

$ git checkout master; egrep 'MIN_PYTHON_VERSION ' CMakeLists.txt
set(MIN_PYTHON_VERSION "3.9")

Hello,

Thanks for your work, as usual very useful to drive the project dynamic.

I realize that I totally missed out that every previous QEP for grant 
proposal have been closed following the workflow change and so ignored 
on this round :(.

Taking a closer look for the occasion, I find that this new QEP 
operation implies a higher technical level. If it corresponds well to 
the evolution of the technical project and responds well (I guess) to 
the needs of developers, I think that it distances even more than before 
from fact proposals other than purely technical. Particularly those 
eligible for grants.

To what extent could we imagine a different workflow for grants than for 
technical evolutions? Could we use the OSGeo pretalx instance used for 
conference submissions at events? There's an integrated voting system.

Regards,
Julien

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Experimental flag
Message-ID: <CADQ4pmA5pFNy=NR9sveDfDUwT+-KKtquNrS+AU2LNSmeO8HLqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello. I have a question about the management of the "experimental" flag in
a newly uploaded plugin version. In metadata.txt in this case I have
experimental=True. However, in
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/svir/#plugin-versions in the row
corresponding to the new version 3.24.0 I don't see the expected symbol of
the flask. I noticed that, with respect to the past, in the form used to
upload a new plugin version now there is no checkbox to specify if the
version is experimental or not. I supposed it would have been extracted
from the metadata, but it looks like that flag was ignored.
Please, may you check about this and possibly suggest to me how to proceed
in case the uploading workflow has changed?
Thanks in advance,
Paolo

P.S.: I see version 3.24.0 has now been approved, without the experimental
flag. I have to delete it, before any user accidentally downloads it
believing it is "stable".
Please let me know how to proceed in order to re-upload the same version as
experimental.
Thanks again,
Paolo

Dear Paolo,

Thank you very much for reporting this.

The experimental checkbox in the upload and new version form has been
removed, as discussed in the issue at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Plugins-Website/issues/71. However, it
appeared that the new version form was not handling the experimental
attribute correctly. A new fix has been submitted to address this issue:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Plugins-Website/pull/99.

Uploading a new version as experimental should now work correctly using the
same workflow.

Best regards,
Lova Andriarimalala

Python 3.10 minimal version was in PR :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/56499

I think it has been closed because the version on MacOS is kind of locked
for now. (not sure about the status now), if I remember correctly.

It's only locked if one decides to use the system-provided version.
It's a packaging choice whether to use things from the base system, or
to decide they are unreasonably old and build a recent version.

But I see the point that the macOS provided version is 3.9.  I wonder if
Apple is going to update it, and if not, what others will do.  3.9 is
scheduled for EOL in 2025-10.

Thank you very much!
I've just re-uploaded version 3.24.0 (experimental) and the interface shows
correctly the flask icon, so the issue was in fact fixed.
