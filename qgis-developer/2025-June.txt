Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Remove layer variable
Message-ID: <5fc94d5bb277eae1d6de430254c918de@sgroe.at>

Hi,

how can I remove a layer variable with Python?

The following returns true, but does not work.

QgsExpressionContextUtils.layerScope(layer).removeVariable("variable_name")

Best regards
Simon

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] ArcGIS Feature Server Advanced Symbology Parsing
Message-ID: <CAAKSpBtjX4+=tVmHtpz1kjnw8KfCq+v1bwNQyhrdq3wUtWJWQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I found a URL parameter that can be added to ArcGIS FeatureServer service
layers that makes the server return more complete and advanced rendering
instructions for the layers.

The difference is mostly seen in layers which use multiple symbol layers
such as polygons with a hatch fill. For layers like that, ArcGIS servers
usually return a single symbol with the colors mixed.
I recommend trying to load the example below, first as a mapserver service
to see the definitions and then as a featureserver service to see how the
drawing info is currently being passed.

I found that if you query the layer metadata with the
*returnAdvancedSymbols* URL parameter set to true, you get back the same
response that ArcGIS Pro gets from the server and uses to create symbology
for feature services.

So instead of requesting the metadata for a layer like QGIS currently does:
https://ags.iplan.gov.il/arcgisiplan/rest/services/PlanningPublic/Xplan/MapServer/4?f=json

The initial metadata query would be:
https://ags.iplan.gov.il/arcgisiplan/rest/services/PlanningPublic/Xplan/MapServer/4?f=json&returnAdvancedSymbols=true

And get back a more complex result if there are advanced symbols on the
layer. The drawingInfo returned is *mostly* compatible with the ESRI CIM
spec, <https://github.com/Esri/cim-spec> but I already encountered some
names that differed between server versions.
While the parameter only appears in esri documentation from version 11.1, I
tested that it is working for services running on ArcGIS Server version as
far back as at least 10.6.

I tried to start implementing this parsing in QGIS (image 3 shows rendering
with my additions), but I want to make it optional until the parsing is
complete and that is where I could use some help.
I added a checkbox to *QgsNewArcGisRestConnectionDialog* where the user can
toggle advanced symbols for a specific service, and managed to save the
setting in the service settings in the profile's QGIS3.ini file.

What I want to do next is pass this parameter on to *QgsAfsProvider* where
I would use that as a switch between *QgsArcGisRestQueryUtils::getLayerInfo*
and the function I added to get the metadata with advanced symbols called
*QgsArcGisRestQueryUtils::getLayerAdvanvcedSymbolsInfo*.

I could use some help in understanding how to read and pass on the
parameter through the QgsAfsSharedData object or in any other way that
might be more correct.

On a side note, I am in the contributor meeting right now until lunch in
case someone is here and can help with this face to face, it would be much
appreciated.

On a second side note, sample service with other types of complex symbols
for points, lines and polygons will also be much appreciated for testing
purposes.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Copy layer vs Duplicate layer ???
Message-ID: <16b08b10-393f-4712-9222-dbda66785701@duif.net>

Hi People,

A user had an issue in which she 'copied' a layer, edited it and then found out she edited the original data...

My response was: yes (join the club ;-)) it is called 'duplicate', but it only duplicates the layer, NOT the data.

Then she responded: but I did not use 'duplicate', I used 'copy layer' ...

Then I found out they indeed both exist in the context menu, and actually do the same thing... ???
(tested with a gpkg and a shapefile)

So my questions:
- should there be 2 context menu items for the same thing (the always tricky 'duplicate' which (in my view) counter-intuitive does not duplicate data)
- should these 2 functions not behave different?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Should there be 2 context menu items for the same thing. --> rather not, it is confusing.

But otherwise, I would say that the current behaviour makes sense: when clicking a layer in the Layers window, the duplicate option in the context menu should duplicate the map layer, not the actual data. 

I would expect the latter behaviour in the context menu for data files in the Browser window. And than it probably should be called 'copy data' or something along those lines?

Just my 2ct as user.

(Without a working QGIS for now as I await the latest release for Ubuntu
25.04, so I cannot confirm my comments below with testing...)

It's my recollection that I too have fallen for the same false solution to
my problem.

I think my current approach is to "save as..." and have the saved copy show
up as a new layer; is that what most people do when they want to creat a
copy of a layer for editing?

>From that perspective, why not just get rid of both the "duplicate" and
"copy" layers since (if I am not wrong) one can equally just open the same
data set as a new layer?

It doesn't seem that we benefit much by those and apparently some of us
have found them distracting...

That's cos it's just removing the variable from a copy of the layer's
expression context scope, not from the layer itself.

It's rather gross, but try
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.40/core/QgsExpressionContextUtils.html#qgis.core.QgsExpressionContextUtils.setLayerVariables
-- you'll need to first retrieve the existing variables via
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.40/core/QgsExpressionContextUtils.html#qgis.core.QgsExpressionContextUtils.layerScope
and then build a dictionary of the variables you want to keep by
iterating over https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.40/core/QgsExpressionContextScope.html#qgis.core.QgsExpressionContextScope.variableNames

Hope that helps!
Nyall

Hi Richard and list,
the QGIS Desktop User Guide / Manual explains such functionalities, 
clearly stating that "The copy uses the same data source as the 
original." / "As for Duplicate, the layers are still based on the same 
data source."

****
"Duplicate" a layer to generate a copy where you can modify the name, 
style (symbology, labels, ?), joins, ? The copy uses the same data 
source as the original.

"Copy" and "Paste" layers or groups from one project to another as a new 
instance whose properties can be modified independently. As for 
Duplicate, the layers are still based on the same data source.
****

See 
https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html#layer

Regards.

Andrea

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Uno strano blocco in Model Designer in batch
 processing
Message-ID: <BE8509E0-2271-4FE2-B3A6-D2CA869C0EA0@outlook.com>

Hi

I have developed several models in Model Designer and I am using them in QGIS in different platforms. I am having a really strange problem especially in the Windows version of QGIS.
My model is very simple:
 in INPUT there is a raster file and a vector file.The working sequence is this:
- the vector file is converted to a raster file with an extension equal to the INPUT raster file;
- in the converted raster all nodata values are converted to the value zero (with FILLNodata);
- output is the converted raster file with an integer value. The Data Type is Int16.

In the model there are 5 algorithms with 2 files in INPUT and 1 file in OUTPUT.
In a few seconds I have the result.

All this, however, is done in Batch Processing and in INPUT all the vector files in a directory are taken. The number of these files may be tens, hundreds or thousands.
Batch Processing is very powerful and allows this kind of work. A very simple Model repeated many times.
I used it in macOS and Linux Ubuntu and managed to create even 2200 files in a few minutes: the model worked 2200 times.

The problem, however, came up in the Windows version. Basically Batch Processing at some point stops completely randomly, for example after 38 processes or after 54 and so on. The model does not exit but stays put and does not start again.

I have tried and tried again in different computers but the result is the same. In Windows, the program stops after running only a few models completely randomly.
I don't understand the source of the problem: is it the memory? Or is it in Windows to clear the cache during the various steps?
The raster area is not large and the final raster file is usually small, about 20 MB.
Batch Processing only works for a few times and then stops.
Can anyone help me with this?

Thanks

Lorenzo

Hi Lene,

Thanks for filing the feature request. I can see it here
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/62149

So you can be assured that it is documented and hopefully some developer
will triage it.


Thanks.

Hi people,

I, like some others I would assume seeing the 10k+ downloads, am using regularly the QGIS plugin "debugvs" https://github.com/lmotta/debug_vs_plugin .
The last pull request, fixing an issue that prevented me and others from using the plugin, is now 2 years old and has not received any comment from the owner.
So I contacted lmotta on the 28/04/2025 on his public email but received no answer, his github also showing no recent public activity.
With of course all due respect to them I would like to keep a functioning state of this plugin published on the official repository.
Could we transfer ownership of this plugin to me or any other volunteer, to at least review and merge contributions?

Thanks,

Ok, so... historically there was only 'Duplicate'... which copied ( ;-) ) the layer within the project.

The Copy/Paste is more recent and meant to copy (layer-xml) from one project to another.

Both, NOT changing/copying datasources (with good reason, just counterintuitive to beginners/humans).

BUT: using Copy/Paste WITHIN one project then, seems to me(!), the same as Copy/Paste within one project?

So, what is then the value of the 'Duplicate' item? Could this be removed?

Anybody aware of functionality in Duplicate which is not in Copy/Paste ?

Regards,

Richard

Duplicate Layer is a handy shortcut rather than copy and paste and I would
be very sad to see it go. Also you can currently only paste into a group or
the blank space at the bottom of the layers list. This is not available if
your layers panel is full. Copy/paste buttons would solve this problem and
make the action more discoverable.
Having "Copy Layer" become "Copy Layer to Clipboard" might help.
Also being next to "Duplicate Layer" could help.The un-undoable "Remove
Layer" next to "Duplicate Layer" can be problematic. The confirmation is
helpful although the "legend entry" terminology rather than layer is
confusing.

In ArcGIS Pro the section in the layer right click equivalent to "export"
is called "data" for exporting features and "sharing" for exporting data
and symbology. This might help people distinguish between the underlying
data source and a gis layer.  But in my experience this is one of the
harder concepts for people to understand.

Sadly this is a known problem that we have not been able to find a solution
to. https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/53806
It does not seem to matter the size of the raster or vector layer.
Anecdotally- I have not noticed it with the most recent version (3.40.3) of
QGIS yet.

Hi Sebastian

Thanks for the information. I read the GitHub page.

I have tested QGIS 3.40.7 and also 3.42.3 and other versions of QGIS for Windows 11 but the problem persists. This model with a single file runs in three seconds so it is not a complexity related problem. I did the test with a batch processing of 113 files and only once out of ten did it run entirely without interruption. Really strange.

At this point for my purposes the only possible workaround is this:
- press Run and wait for the batch processing to work;

- if it gets to the end without any problems, you will have all the files saved but if at some point it stops and does not go on you have to press the QGIS close button in the upper right corner;

- a window will open asking you if you want to stop batch processing and press Yes;

- go back into batch processing and delete all the rows that have already been executed (from the log you see the number of the tif created);

- there will be fewer rows to run and press Run

- wait and if it crashes again proceed as seen above by removing the rows that have already been executed, to the end.


It is definitely not comfortable this solution but it is the only one that works for now.


It seems that more than QGIS or Python there is something in the operation of the operating system that sends something into the memory stream. So far in fact I have not yet encountered this problem in macOS or Linux, but maybe it is just luck. It is a pity because Batch Processing is a very powerful tool indeed. Thanks again

Hi

I have developed several models in Model Designer and I am using them in QGIS in different platforms. I am having a really strange problem especially in the Windows version of QGIS.
My model is very simple:
 in INPUT there is a raster file and a vector file.The working sequence is this:
- the vector file is converted to a raster file with an extension equal to the INPUT raster file;
- in the converted raster all nodata values are converted to the value zero (with FILLNodata);
- output is the converted raster file with an integer value. The Data Type is Int16.

In the model there are 5 algorithms with 2 files in INPUT and 1 file in OUTPUT.
In a few seconds I have the result.

All this, however, is done in Batch Processing and in INPUT all the vector files in a directory are taken. The number of these files may be tens, hundreds or thousands.
Batch Processing is very powerful and allows this kind of work. A very simple Model repeated many times.
I used it in macOS and Linux Ubuntu and managed to create even 2200 files in a few minutes: the model worked 2200 times.

The problem, however, came up in the Windows version. Basically Batch Processing at some point stops completely randomly, for example after 38 processes or after 54 and so on. The model does not exit but stays put and does not start again.

I have tried and tried again in different computers but the result is the same. In Windows, the program stops after running only a few models completely randomly.
I don't understand the source of the problem: is it the memory? Or is it in Windows to clear the cache during the various steps?
The raster area is not large and the final raster file is usually small, about 20 MB.
Batch Processing only works for a few times and then stops.
Can anyone help me with this?

Thanks

Lorenzo

Good morning, everyone,
I am experiencing some translation quirks in the following versions of QGIS:
- LTR dev
- LTR
- 3.42
- dev

The menu main titles ?Vector? and ?Raster? are not translated and are not
present in Transifex either as original or translated text.

How to solve it?

thanks to all

s.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Flatpak build experiences?
Message-ID: <56012490-82da-4467-8b10-293d8adeabb7@duif.net>

Hi,

Thought to start a little local hackfest here :-)

Because at a client for which I build plugins (build env is alma-linux), I have to use Flatpaks to run current version of QGIS.

This works pretty well!

So I thought: if there is a Windows-QT6 build, why not a Qt6-Flatpak one for the pinguins, so they can start fixing their plugins for QGIS 4.0 :-)

BUT, my first try of a local build of current Flatpak build:

# Take the org.qgis.qgis.json recipe from https://github.com/flathub/org.qgis.qgis
# clone flatpub repo
git clone git at github.com:flathub/org.qgis.qgis.git
# get shared modules
git clone --recurse-submodules git at github.com:flathub/org.qgis.qgis.git
# to update gitmodules:
# git submodule update --remote --merge
# then start the build:
flatpak-builder --force-clean --user --install-deps-from=flathub --repo=repo --install builddir org.qgis.qgis.json

this works pretty good, as I can see the build download sources from all dependencies, building them etc etc

Butn the end it builds QGIS, and that stops with sip failures:

it ends with:

/run/build/qgis/python/gui/auto_generated/qgsmapcanvas.sip: line 278: 'throw' is deprecated and will be removed in SIP v7.0.0
sip-build: class 'Ui::Qgs25DRendererWidgetBase' has not been defined

class 'Ui::QgsTextFormatWidgetBase' has not been defined

class 'Ui::QgsOWSSourceSelectBase' has not been defined
class 'QgsTopologicalMesh::Changes' has not been defined
ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.
Error: module qgis: Child process exited with code 1


Note: I'm still building the 'stable' 3.42.3 here, from
https://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-3.42.3.tar.bz2
see
https://github.com/flathub/org.qgis.qgis/blob/master/org.qgis.qgis.json#L44-L45


Anybody hints on how to fix this? Or debug?

I can only start a fresh QGIS build every time now... which eats time of my hackday :-)

And if anybody is interested in the NEXT step: adjusting the build to build Qt6, that would be great.

My final goal is to have an easy Qt-6 QGIS available for Linux users on platforms which are not able (yet) to build Qt6-QGIS because of dependency issues...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all,

I just noticed that SIP v5+ has a new annotation NoCopyCtor
https://python-sip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/annotations.html#mapped-type-annotation-NoCopyCtor

If anyone has a better understanding of the underlying logic, should we use
this rather than forcing the declaration of copy constructors on the sip
files?

Cheers,
Denis

Argh, no sorry.

I thought it should be flatpak related because my local normal (debian) builds were fine

It's a tricky business building this beast, apparently so many moving targets underlying it...

Thanks! Will see if I can make the recipe build against master instead of a released source zip...

It looks like a recurring issue in the latest QGIS versions allegedly.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Using QML widget as editing widget
Message-ID: <c7bb8300-6c70-4293-8daf-c4fa1edbf62a@gmail.com>

Hi list -

I've been doodling a while using the QML widget i QGIS (version 3.42, 
Windows) : and I have a question: Is it possible to design a editing 
widget using the QML widget as a base?

And the why ? :

I have a postgres table, where one of the fields is a "jsonb" object. I 
can /show/ the json values using the "Json view" widget or even make the 
elements of the json object editable using the "key/value" widget (my 
json object are "flat": only a series of key/value pairs).

However, I would like to add a drop-down value list to some of the 
elements in the jsonb field, so the user can choose a value from a list 
instead of writing the value using a keyboard.

As far as i can see, i have couple of potential choices: Try to subclass 
the "key/value" widget if that's possible from python and extend the 
functionality.

Or design a QML document which shows the json element in a number of 
combo-boxes.

And hence the question: Can i replace the field value with the changed 
version from a QML widget. And how ??

Hi Bo,

With the qml widget, you can mostly do shiny data representation, it's not
optimized for editing.
Have a look at this blog post from my colleague Dave
https://www.opengis.ch/2018/11/06/qml-widgets-qgis/

It's also possible to create custom widgets with python, but it requires a
few classes to be implemented.
The main entry point is registering a custom QgsEditorWidgetFactory with
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.40/gui/QgsEditorWidgetRegistry.html#qgis.gui.QgsEditorWidgetRegistry.registerWidget
and from the factory create new QgsEditorWidgetWrappers. This will create
new widgets which can (if you want) also be based on
https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qquickwidget.html and render QML this way.
There is an example on
https://github.com/opengisch/stdm/blob/master/stdm/ui/forms/spatial_unit_form.py
(without QML).

Best wishes
Matthias

Thanks Chris, Richard and Paulo for sharing your views.

I note that in 3.40.5, choosing 'Duplicate layer' does cause a pop-up 
notice to say:

Layer duplication complete: Note that it's using the same data source.

Although this does disappear after ~5 seconds.

I tried 'copy layer' and was baffled for a moment, then I realised there 
was a 'paste layer' option which I had to do (before anything visible 
happened. Yes, the layer definition was copied to the clipboard when I 
clicked copy).

Both Duplicate layer and Copy-Paste layer work on multiple layers at 
once, and groups as well.

Interestingly keyboard shortcut Ctrl-C Ctrl-V doesn't copy and paste as 
you might expect.

Ctrl-C does nothing as far as I can tell. Ctrl-V gives me this message:

Layer not editable: The current layer is not editable. Choose 'Start 
editing' in the digitizing toolbar.

So I think it would make sense to remove the 'Copy Layer' / 'Paste 
Layer' options.

Thanks!
Nick.

Hi Nick,
Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V (and Ctrl+X) actually work on the layer content, i.e. 
for features: they correspond respectively to the "Copy Features" and 
"Paste Features" (and "Cut Features") actions.
The "Layer not editable" message is expected if the selected layer is 
not in edit mode, since it is not possible to paste features in a layer 
not editable.

For further reference and details:

Message-ID: <rmi1pruqrck.fsf@s1.lexort.com>

For background:

  pkgsrc is behind, on 3.34.x.  (Yes, I know 3.40 is out. :-)

  pkgsrc follows LTRs.  Probably we should move to every release,
  because we don't need LTR, and non-LTR releases are not unstable, just
  updated for a shorter period.

1) We have py-sip6 6.10.0.  6.11.1 and 6.12.0 have been released.  I
have a note that py-sip6 updates tend to break the qgis build.  If I
swap either in, I get build failures (and they look the same).  I know
you don't want to debug 3.34 and I don't want to either, so I'm not
posting them.  But

  a) Is anyone building any qgis with py-sip6 6.12.0, and is it ok?

  b) If it is ok with any qgis, is 3.40 ok?

2) I see on the blog about 4.0 being qt6 only.  I am guessing that for
stable use of 3.40, I should keep the package on qt5.  If that's not
true, it would be good to understand the consensus of packagers on what
to do.

3) Assuming I'm going to move eventually from 3.40 to 4.2(LTR) or
whatever it is, should I

   a) add a qgis-next package that is 3.40 but with qt6, and then move
      that along every release?

   b) add qgis-next but stay on qt6, and then at ? switch to qt6?

   c) something else?

Or, assuming I track every release, on which one should I have qt5 and
then change to qt6, or should I jump to qt6 with 4.0?

Thanks,
Greg

Yeah, I had exactly this problem while buiding my flatpak experiment.
The lastest source zip has this issue, so I ended up just using master, which then worked
But you will problably have to wait till the next point release?

My personal(!) view for Linux packaging (as Linux user, not packager).

Stick to 3.40/LTR/Qt5 for QGIS3.
(Well, that is what our Debian packager does, not sure what your users expect)

One reason to have a Qt6 package available is that you give Plugin devs the ability to have Qt6 based QGIS so they have update/test their plugins.

Because I foresee dependency issues (Debian), I'm testing the flatpak route, so Linux users can install a Qt6 build flatpak next to their Qt5 build for experiments.

I'd say: QGIS4 is Qt6-only, but we need to have a Qt6 option (be it 3.40 or higher) available for (Linux) python devs.

Note that, thanks to Juergen, Windows users/devs already have the option to test their plugins with an osgeo4w Qt6 build
(see QGISQT6-OSGeo4W-3.42..msi on https://download.qgis.org/downloads/)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS, thinking about DebianGIS now, not sure what their plans are with Qt6 builds...

Thanks for pointing that out.  Wow, I already have a note to be scared
of sip updates; I'll have to update it :-(.

Sounds like 3.40.8 will be ok and out soon.  I'll just defer sip6 update
until after that.  (I don't want to add that PR as a patch, as there is
no compelling reason to make the sip6 update soon.)

Thanks.  I have been LTR only, but thinking about moving to following
all releases once they hit .1.  I do not perceive them as at all
unstable.


Sounds like I should add a qt5/qt6 option group, mostly the test that
the qt6 things are packaged and that it works, and then be prepared to
flip it for 4, and later remove it.

J?rgen is also working on Qt6 support for Debian:

Then you can install the Qt5- and the Qt6-versions alongside each other. 
Packagers can then use the new cmake options to also offer both builds.

Hi Denis,

I imagine that you're thinking of this kind of declaration:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/5b59269f98799597df125744823a0163d3061548/src/core/expression/qgsexpressionnodeimpl.h#L93

But this is a Mapped Type Annotation, not a Class annotation, so I don't see how we
could use this.

Regards,
Julien

Hello,

I have a general question about pull requests: What can I do about a PR 
getting the label stale and then getting closed? I have this one, for 
example:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/61706

Nyall Dawson had put a Freeze Exempt Label on it, so I suppose I wasn't 
total nonsense :).

 ?Is that just the way it goes, and one is just out of luck if no one 
approves in time? Should I make a new identical PR, or could it be 
reopened?

I did \o/

And I managed to create a Single-file bundle which works/tested on my and Raymond's laptop.

I will sent some instructions in a separate email

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Experimental Qt6 Flatpak build available for
 Linux/Python devs (for updating plugins)
Message-ID: <9d335ac5-2e4e-4745-b7c3-c1806ee8acdb@duif.net>

Hi,

Based on the excellent Flatpak work of Aleix Pol (https://github.com/flathub/org.qgis.qgis), I managed to create a runnable Qt6 build of QGIS for Linux's (with flatpak available)

My idea is that Linux users of distro's without the needed dependencies can run QGIS and test/update their Python plugins with this build.
This flatpak build (master) is (thanks to Aleix!) having 3D and PDAL/cloudpoint available too.

Note that this is my first flatpak build, probably things go/are wrong, and I'm not sure how to do further/future distribution...

But for now: to run/try it:

Download the single-bundle file from

http://duif.net/qgis-qt6.flatpak

If you do not have flatpak/flathub available, make sure you do by doing the steps at

https://flatpak.org/setup/ for your distro, to
1) install flatpak and
2) make the flathub repo available for needed runtimes and sdk's.

Now go to the qgis-qt6.flatpak file and INSTALL it:

flatpak install --runtime --include-sdk qgis-qt6.flatpak

(this will install the KDE runtime and sdk and then finally the qgis-qt6 system wide)

Then to run it:

flatpak run org.qgis.qgis

I hope this is useful for anybody.

Have to talk to Aleix for more finesses to maybe share this on flathub or with his Qt5 build.

If you want to build it yourself there is some info in: https://github.com/flathub/org.qgis.qgis/issues/428

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Moritz

I see Even has reopened it for you. Just bear in mind that unless you are
working for a commercial project and can pay a reviewer to review your
PR's, you will be relying on the good will of a developer who may or may
not have time to review your PR. You may need to be gently persistent and
patient, along with a little social engineering to get your PR reviewed and
merged.

Regards

Tim

Hi J?rgen, hi all,

Would it also be possible to add pydantic to the list of installed packages
on the standalone installer and make it available on Osgeo4w too (it's not
there yet I think).

Thanks a lot,
Denis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3.44 projects compatibility with previous
 versions
Message-ID: <CADBCwLaFnEX1Fe5YOeXC_+62waF441RaoiFZi-joS=c6vEx-qg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

During the last dev cycle, a change was introduced in the way that
properties are stored in the .qgs xml file
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/60855

While this solved a real issue (data-driven properties could result in an
invalid property name with a leading digit) in an elegant way and is
technically backwards compatible (projects generated with older versions
can be opened without issues), it has the side effect that projects stored
with 3.44 will not properly load in older QGIS versions (stored properties
are ignored and also project CRS is undefined). Plugins could also
malfunction as they often use project properties for storing their
project-related configurations.

One potential solution would be to backport this to LTR, however from my
experience a good percentage of the users use older QGIS versions and even
those on LTR do not always upgrade as soon as a new release is out, so
backporting could eventually make things worse!

With QGIS 4.0 around the corner, imho, it would be better to defer this
change for a couple more months and only include this kind-of-breaking
change in QGIS 4.0

I briefly chatted with Jurgen at the hackfest about this and while
acknowledging the issue, was not super happy to revert, so I'm interested
in gathering more opinions here.

Best
Stefanos

Message-ID: <CAMtDFLJYEUQtNJtMc-xdMecUGEUSSH-XgkSD-+9EN9x-BY5_3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

On the main qgis.org website, for Debian, the list of repositories is
written :
https://www.qgis.org/resources/installation-guide/#repositories

For instance for Debian 12 : https://qgis.org/debian-ltr

But, it seems the packaging for QGIS 3.40 stopped at 3.40.3 :
https://debian.qgis.org/debian/dists/bookworm/main/binary-amd64/Packages
QGIS 3.40.4 and later are not in this repository.

While it is available on Debian repository :
https://packages.debian.org/bookworm-backports/qgis

Is-this a bug or should we switch to Debian repositories ?
Thanks

Message-ID: <91670304-004c-4568-8406-3ec59690e0d4@ign.fr>

Dear colleagues,

I have a problem with some plugins while installing them on windows. It 
happens on windows 10 or 11. I get an error message saying that the 
archive seems to be corrupted, whereas the same plugin/archive can be 
installed on linux.

I made the test on one of my plugin, IdentifProj. I get an error on? 
windows 11. If I extract the archive on windows and then create a new 
zip file, I can now install it from this new archive. Did anyone has 
this kind of problem ?

Regards,

Jacques

Hi Jacques,

by accident I had something like that recently, and it had to do with the use of - or _ in the zip names...

If I recall myself, we had a plugin call testplugin and I put it in testplugin_0.1.1.zip (or testplugin-0.1.1.zip??).
When you try to install that QGIS could not find the plugin anymore after installation...

So I thought to see if that was a bug, but then found out that if you upload such a plugin to the official repo, the - or _ are stripped from the zip name...
So only because we worked with an internal website as repo (which did not strip that stripes) we have that issue.

Maybe you have something like that too?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

I did something similar in the symbology area and I went for saving twice
the data.
We could probably leave the two at the same time in the same tag:

<properties>
  <foo>
    <bar type="QString">baz</bar>
  </foo>
  <properties name="foo">
    <properties name="bar" type="QString">baz</properties>
  </properties>
</properties>

Old QGIS would only save the old, new QGIS would save both and use the new
if it exists.

Best of the 2 worlds?

Cheers,
Denis

Hi Richard,

It might be that but when I upload the plugin it has no - ou _ in the 
name (eg IdentifProj.zip). When I download it (or when Qgis tries to 
dowlnoad it) it comes back as IdentifProj-0.5.zip but I can imagine it 
is an automatic process.

just thinking that it will probably give the same error message!
so maybe a v2 like:

<properties>
  <foo>
    <bar type="QString">baz</bar>
  </foo>
</properties>
<properties-v2>
  <properties name="foo">
    <properties name="bar" type="QString">baz</properties>
  </properties>
</properties-v2>

Message-ID: <CAJNF4C0D7hrhH12npQYujJMrV6UJ3BkNSrJ2pe-oid1_70fhhA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Iam trying to develop custom map viewer using qgis api in qt and cpp. I am
not getting linker error. I have download qgis-dev packages using osgeo
network installer. I have installed visual studio 2022 community edition.
Is there any step by step procedure to install and add libraries and header
files properly for Windows 10?

Thanks in advance. Regards
Manya.

Of course.  As always the next release 3.42 replaced the previous 3.40 in our
debian repository and as the previous release was a ltr it's next point
released replaced the old ltr in the debian-ltr repository.  IOW 3.40.4 to 7
are in debian-ltr, while debian has 3.42.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] MacOS Qt6 builds / Notarization
Message-ID: <CAC7zN95iZdBB4TWT6THxeS1625UBNogq8ydrQrt_Ee7O8FaFXQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Over the last few months I've made good progress on the mac build front.
Since the beginning of the year, a pull request has been open that builds
QGIS against recent, updated dependencies and Qt6 and creates a dmg
installer for download.
These packages provide universal binaries that work natively on Intel x64
and ARM machines.

Overall, the feedback of testers has been encouraging and many things could
already be ironed out.

Since last week it is now also possible to download notarized versions of
these builds. The scripts are in https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-notarize/
and in the actions on this repository, the notarized packages can be
downloaded and we also have encouraging feedback there.
Eventually I would like to only notarize releases (and not pull requests)
and use an OSGEO certificate (not the current OPENGIS.ch one) and produce
the packages on a repository under the qgis organization. I'll handle that
in the upcoming weeks.

Since this is a complete refactoring and cleanup of the mac build chain, it
would break the current Qt5 builds and was therefore not merged to not
break releases on the QGIS 3 series.

With the last minor release QGIS 3 approaching, I would like to proceed
with merging this right after 3.44 has been branched off. The pull request
is rather large so it's good if this has a long cooldown period before it's
released with QGIS 4 later this year. Whoever feels comfortable reviewing
cmake code changes, please do so before Friday next week, June 20.

Thanks a lot and best wishes
Matthias

Strange, it's just the root of Apache.
Though, now I see, I gave a http url, maybe your browser does not want http, but httpS?
And I do not have redirection http->https on it because of... testing stuff

Is the flatpak working on nixos?

Hi,
Nice work, it works well, on Ubuntu Noble for me. Thanks !

Indeed, I got some issues trying to click on the link in Firefox and
Chromium, because unsecure HTTP protocol with a "direct" link to a
downloadable file (and maybe executable file as well ?)

I don't have any rights over this, but that's a +1 for me as well.

I would also like to highlight that the issue preventing Ilian and
others from using the plugin affects Windows and MacOS users. And
since QGIS on Windows accounts for the majority of users (and plugin
users ! )  according to  QGIS's own metrics this makes targeting and
debugging plugins for the most popular platform even more challenging.

As Ilian said, a fix exists[1]. While I did not review the PR, the fix
is working for me locally.  The author of the PR seems to be a member
of OSGeo Japan and maybe he would like to be involved too ?

Regards,
Valentin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 3.40 mac binary version of qgis spuriously writing
 geopackage files, old sqlite3?
Message-ID: <rmiwm9egk2x.fsf@s1.lexort.com>

This is a little long, but the summary is

  3.40.7, mac binary from qgis.org, appear to write geopackage files
  when qgis is merely reading them and no layer write operation is
  invoked.  This is "obviously wrong" from my viewpoint, but I can't
  find any documentation.

  Not that I think it really matters to the above, but the sqlite
  version included in the 3.40 mac installer is much older than I would
  have expected.

  The qgis user manual doesn't explain how this is supposed to work, and
  the code doesn't have enough comments to see if it is doing what it is
  supposed to be doing.

  The "isLocal" code seems wrong in the general case.

For background -- since I know it's unusual -- I've been mostly using
qgis on NetBSD, built via pkgsrc.  It's been working well.  I just
updated from 3.34.x to 3.40.7, and yes, I know that was overdue.  I have
several of project files, and data, which I believe is pretty normal:
  - several gpkg files, usually with multiple tables
  - postgis
  - a few csv files (that I treat as read only)
  - geodatabases and shp from MassGIS (that I treat as read only)
  - jp2/tif tiles of imagery
  - online WMTS/TMS

I use unison (a user-mode synchronization program, and I happen to be
the maintainer) as a replicated filesystem across machines, mostly for
sort-of-backup and partially for editing on secondary machines.  As a
side effect unison alerts me to changes, so I notice things others might
not.

Long ago I remember a problem where qgis (via gdal) would write (in a
filesystem sense) a gpkg file when it was merely opened for reading.  A
fix was made to gdal to enable reading a database to simply.... read the
database file, apparently in gdal 3.4.2, now long-ago history,
  https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/5207
and then used in qgis:
  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/47098
There is also
  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/48059

(Separately from unison, whenever there is any kind of sync going on,
writing files when reading datasets turns a "read read" operation, which
is not a sync conflict, into a "write write" operation, which will be a
conflict if the first write does not get synced to the machine that does
the second read before that second read.  Thus, from long experience
with distributed filesystems including disconnected operation, I'm of
the opinion that logically reading should ~never result in a write.)

Since those changes, I have been able to start qgis on a project file
with geopackage layers, look at the project (and perhaps edit other
layers), and exit, without any fileysystem writes to the gpkg file.  I
think it even refrains from opening the file for write and not writing
-- which on most local filesystems does not cause a modification but can
interact badly with distributed filesystems such as coda.  I have no
memory of having to set anything; my memory is that with fixes to
qgis/gdal, it just worked correctly (where correctly means reading is
reading, not reading is writing).

Now, I have a project that had two gpkg layers, that I added a shapefile
to, just to visualize the shapefile and to load it into QField.  I was
planning to ignore the other layers when looking at the new data, and to
omit the older layers in QField export.  And, I wanted to access this
project on a mac notebook, so I installed 3.40 on it, via qgis.org.

On the mac, I started up qgis, and looked at the shapefile, panning and
zooming, querying features, but not enabling write in any layer.

Later, I noticed that the gpkg files had been written.

Comparing a copy from [before (the -back and the modified file:

foobar-backup-baz.gpkg: SQLite 3.x database (OGC GeoPackage file), user version 10200, last written using SQLite version 3048000, file counter 29, database pages 24, cookie 0x2f, schema 4, UTF-8, version-valid-for 29
foobar.gpkg:            SQLite 3.x database (OGC GeoPackage file), user version 10200, last written using SQLite version 3035002, file counter 35, database pages 24, cookie 0x2f, schema 4, UTF-8, version-valid-for 35

I see that the file counter has been incremented 6 times (and
version-valid-for, correspondingly), and the last-written version
changed from 3.48.0 to 3.35.2.

sqlite3 versions:

  3.49.2	NetBSD/pkgsrc machine (but plausibly 3.48.0 when the
                gpkg was last written)

  3.35.2	apparently the version in the qgis mac binary
  3.39.5	/usr/bin/sqlite3 on mac
  3.48.0	pkgsrc version on mac

This is surprising; it makes sense that Apple is behind (macOS 13)
because that's what they do, but 3.35 seems much older than I'd expect.

Doing cmp -l backup current:
    28  35  43
    96  35  43
    99 202 117
   100 100 172


I found
  https://torymur.github.io/sqlite-repr/
which is really useful, when used with emacs hexl mode, as "sqlite3
foobar.gpkg dump" omits metadata and sqlite3 doesn't seem to have a full
deconstruct option.

So my sqlite file change is read version +=8, valid version same, and
last write sqlite version changed.  .dump is the same for both, and
"file" above shows all the differences.

This is repeatable; open/view/close results in sqlite version change and
+2 in the database version.  Today, with 3.40.7 built under pkgsrc
(really a pretty straightforward build), and 3.40.7 mac official, I find
that

  NetBSD pkgsrc: read is read
  macOS official: read is write (modified and I see wal when qgis is open)

So, the bug is that read is opening a journal, on macOS.

Looking at 3.40.7:

  src/core/providers/ogr/qgsogrproviderutils.cpp : QgsOgrProviderUtils::GDALOpenWrapper

It looks like QGIS_FORCE_WAL is set (to nullptr) for any geopackage,
even those that are unrelated to offline editing (a feature I've never
used).  This doesn't seem to be from PR #48059.  It seems that databases
for offline storage should have some  sidecar way to force journaling
for read, but naively I'd expect those to be opened for write anyway.

Then there seems to be code to detect local and set NOLOCK on reading.

And, if not local, to say no journal period.  (I have no idea if sqlite
really works correctly on remote filesystems but I'm in the "don't do
that" camp.)

Reading the isLocal code, I notice there are three implementations: one
for Windows, one for Linux, and one for POSIX except Linux (and maybe
android?).  I can't understand the code.  It refers to "path" which
might be relative and not to "dirName" which is absolute (but a path,
not a directory name, if the qt code names make sense).  And then it
outright compares path to "nfs" and "smbfs" which appear to intend to be
filesystem *types*, not pathnames, not using info.fileSystemType which
was just computed.

But, that means isLocal should always return true, unless the data
source is literally a relative path to a file named nfs or smbfs.

Greg,

what is the GDAL version of the Mac binary? If it is older than 3.4.2 
that could explain it.

For the issue with IsLocalFile() implementation for 
non-Windows/non-Linux OS, that should be fixed per 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/62284

GDAL 3.3.2, released 2021/09/01

Wow, it never crossed my mind that the mac packages would be so out of
date; that's 3.75 years ago.  Sorry -- I should have checked -- but I
assumed that 3.40.x builds would have dependencies that were more or
less current at the time 3.40 started.  I should have become suspicious
from the very old sqlite3.

Wow, that was quick.

So it sounds like, if I have a build

  3.40.x

  with modern gdal

then on all platforms, if I just open a qgis project that has geopackage
layers, causing them to be read, but do not click the 'edit layer'
button, then I should expect that the geopackage file is not written, or
even opened for writing at the system call level?


And after 62284 is backported, whatever special "turn off WAL harder" is
supposed to happen on non-local will happen on non-local, while it
doesn't now.  (That doesn't affect me because I don't put data on
non-local filesystems.)

Hi Greg,
qgis.org doen't provide the QGIS LTR 3.40.7 installer for macOS.
The latest available QGIS LTR installer for macOS available at qgis.org 
is QGIS LTR 3.40.5.

As explained in the Download page https://qgis.org/download/ of qgis.org:

"The QGIS installers for macOS are currently outdated and may not 
reflect the latest version shown in QGIS notifications. We are actively 
working to update the macOS packages. If you need newer features or 
fixes, please consider installing QGIS via MacPorts."

Moreover, the QGIS installers for macOS available at qgis.org have old 
dependent packages like GDAL.

As advised in the Download page of qgis.org:

"Alternatively, for native support of both Intel x86 and Apple ARM 
architectures, together with the latest versions of key components (e.g. 
GDAL, PDAL, GRASS GIS) see MacPorts Installing Instructions 
https://qgis.org/resources/installation-guide/#macports "

Best regards.

I probably missed that and have 3.40.5.   Two micros back is of course
behind but not a big deal compared to the WAL bugs.

I managed not to read that, or not to absorb that "old" might mean "so
old it's hard to comprehend" vs "gdal 3.9 instead of 3.10".  If they are
that old, perhaps they should be withdrawn?  Or perhaps change the text
to list versions and when they were released, so people can be warned.

Duly noted about homebrew; pkgsrc is the same way, but currently qgis
there is set up for normal computers, not macs, which Do Many Things
Different.  It's messy to choose between 'build a normal POSIX program
that uses X' and 'build the special mac way instead' in a portable
packaging system (which homebrew isn't, so they don't have this
problem).

(I don't understand the mac .App build process at all, as I mostly live
in the POSIX world.  I wonder if the official binary should be a
homebrew build bootstrapped under a different prefix so it's
self-contained, sort of all under /opt/homebrew-qgis, that then can just
be unpacked, and have that replace the outdated version.)

Sorry, I confused macports and homebrew.  I see that qgis is pointing to
macports (and there's the caution not to install both, probably because
they use the same prefix).

The warning text at

  https://qgis.org/download/  macos section

is

  ?? QGIS versions for macOS notice

  The QGIS installers for macOS are currently outdated and may not
  reflect the latest version shown in QGIS notifications. We are
  actively working to update the macOS packages. If you need newer
  features or fixes, please consider installing QGIS via MacPorts. Thank
  you for your patience and understanding.

which doesn't mention "dependencies from 2021".


Something else which I've always found awkward is that the installater
is

  https://qgis.org/downloads/macos/qgis-macos-ltr.dmg

which seems to have variable content.  For caching, for clarifyt, and
for reproducing a specific install on a new computer, I would far rather
see this be:

  https://qgis.org/downloads/macos/qgis-macos-3.40.5.dmg

and just have the link in the page changed.



As another random comment, I find

  "Download QGIS for your platform"

followed by

  windows stuff

and then

  "Other Platforms"

to be strange.  I would expect the title to be just

  "Download QGIS"

and then a "Windows" section, just like the other platform sections,
with no "other platforms" header.   That's very windows-normative!

Hi ilan, Valentin and Plugin Repository Maintainers,

I am the author of the PR (https://github.com/lmotta/debug_vs_plugin/pull/18),
and I appreciate you raising this issue.

Personally, I suggest creating a new plugin - such as "debugvs2"
(https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/debug_vs2/),
rather than transferring ownership of the plugin.
Because I feel changing the ownership of an existing plugin without
the current owner's confirmation is a bit risky as FOSS spirits.

But I want to confirm the Plugin Repository Maintainers' opinion.

Best regards,
Nagase

Hi everyone,

I agree with Nagase's suggestion. As a maintainer of the Plugins
Repository, I would not advise transferring ownership unless the current
owner has confirmed it.

Best regards,

Lova Andriarimalala

FYI, I have been trying to contact him also.

Another option I'm trying is to contact the Brazilian user group, asking if they know if he is still active in the foss/qgis universe. They are active on channels I'm not :-) Maybe others can ask there?

Else: I'd second the idea of a debugvs2 plugin

Thank you, this is super useful!

Is there a way to make it not mask my system QGIS? After I installed 
this on Manjaro or Ubuntu, it took over "QGIS" in the launcher menu. The 
only way I could still run my normal QGIS was via "qgis" in the terminal.

I expect this to be some configuration setting of flatpak itself, but 
found literally nothing via Google. So maybe it is something flatpak 
build specific or my Google fu has broken.

Cheers, Hannes

I think this has to do with the fact that I did not change the id/name of the application.
It's still called "org.qgis.qgis"...
Maybe I should call it something like "org.qgis.qgis.next" or so? "org.qgis.qgis.qt6'?
Then I think it will not conflict with the normal flatpak qgis...

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi

I was wondering if I should name the new macos builds org.qgis.qgis4 (they
are still org.qgis.qgis3).

Oh, I meant not another Flatpak QGIS but really the system-wide QGIS 
(/usr/bin/qgis). The system QGIS is still available via a terminal but 
the Flatpak one has taken over "QGIS" in the GUI (in the "start" menus, 
launchers, whatever those are called).

Maybe that is just on my system(s) though?

Cheers, Hannes

Hi Hannes,


this could be due to the fact that the flatpak .desktop file has the 
same "Name". You could solve this by copying both the .desktop files 
(flatpak and system-wide) in your user application directory, for 
example (local paths may vary):

/cp /usr/share/applications/org.qgis.qgis.desktop 
~/.local/share/applications//

/cp /var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/org.qgis.qgis.desktop 
~/.local/share/applications//

and change the name of one of the two (Name attribute), for example 
setting "QGIS Desktop Flatpak Qt6"

Should be automatically picked up, otherwise you can run

/update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/

See also 
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_entries#Modify_desktop_files


I hope this helps!

Cheers,

Ulisse

Hi Ulisse,

yes, that was it, thank you!

For my case the solution is simply removing the desktop file of the 
Flatpak QGIS:

/sudo rm /var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/org.qgis.qgis.desktop
sudo update-desktop-database/

Now my system QGIS is working as intended and I can use the Flatpak QGIS 
for testing via

/flatpak run org.qgis.qgis/

Cheers, Hannes

Hi Matthias,

thank you for the effort! I?ve been running the arm64 builds from the #60039 PR now for about half a year with very positive results. The biggest challenges were the lacking Qt6 plugin compatibility.

I?m now running the notarized builds linked below and can confirm they work with no apparent problems on macOS 15.5 (24F74) with an M2 Pro.

All the best
Dieter

So, probably it's best to try to communicate with him via the issue tracker?
And discuss about taking over maintenance or forking?

Hi J?rgen,

Just wondering, is this something feasible?
pydantic is quite spread nowadays, would be great to have it around by
default.

Kind regards and many thanks,
Denis

Hi Richard, Loba, ilan and Valentin,

Okay, thanks for the information!

At the moment, I'm busy with my new job,
so taking over things is a bit difficult for me.
However, I will do my best to stay updated on the communication and discussion.

Best regards,
Nagase

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Labeling pull requests appropriately for docs and
 changelog repositories
Message-ID: <dce17139-65c1-43bc-a8e4-4fa4e044cf1b@gmail.com>

Dear developers,

Yesterday, I spent quite some time browsing pull requests in the code 
repo to find new features that should be documented and were not labeled 
appropriately. I stopped after I labeled 15, starting from last October, 
ranging from simple features to complex/hidden ones [1].

I know most of us already follow the process correctly so this email is 
to remind those that ignore or forget it that labeling pull requests or 
commits introducing new features, for documentation purpose, is part of 
the global QGIS development process we agree on[2]. So please try to do 
it and make sure your PR description is up to date. This very much makes 
life easier for docs writers.
I could extend this request to adding the "Changelog" label.

[1] If you want to find more, check 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3AChangelogHarvested+-label%3A%22Needs+Documentation%22+

I'm not sure I like the idea of adding the data there twice. It feels like
pollution that we inevitably need to deal with at some point!

I'd really rather defer the fix for ~3 months until QGIS 4.0, especially
since the bug it fixes has come unnoticed for sooo long :)

Best
Stefanos

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Trouble compiling QGIS in DEBUG mode on Windows
Message-ID: <CAEvoHPeZUdny_E2v=FprFTCRm9gkJmTKnJPX7wzCNe6HnuFGTw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Developers,

I'm reaching out for advice regarding an issue I'm encountering while
trying to compile QGIS in DEBUG mode. My goal is to troubleshoot and
potentially fix unexpected behavior related to QgsCheckableComboBox. To aid
in the debugging process, I wanted to enable more detailed logging
using QgsDebugMsgLevel, as described in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL.md#8-debug-output-and-running-tests,
section 8.

However, compiling QGIS in Debug mode fails with errors, as shown here:
https://cdash.orfeo-toolbox.org/build/32095

The log was generated after configuring the build with:
-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
The entire build was executed using the package.sh script from:

I usually work with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, and initially, I
suspected some misconfiguration on my part. However, it?s now unclear to me
whether compiling QGIS in DEBUG mode is even a standard or recommended
approach in this context. Even when building in RelWithDebInfo and defining
the QGISDEBUG macro, the debug messages from QgsDebugMsgLevel still don?t
show up.

A few questions I would appreciate clarification on:
    ? Is DEBUG mode supported and used by QGIS developers for debugging?
    ? Is QgsDebugMsgLevel still commonly used, and what is the proper setup
to get it working?
    ? Do I really need to rebuild all dependencies
(e.g., libprotobuf-lite, draco, etc.) in DEBUG mode for QGIS to compile
this way?

Any guidance or confirmation from someone experienced in building QGIS in
full DEBUG mode would be highly appreciated.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS version 3.98 instead of 3.99 ?
Message-ID: <85775f4b-fb0e-4c73-b947-95359965869f@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

I see we now use 3.99 as dev version for QGIS.
But 99% of devs have max version 3.99 in their metadata.txt
So 99% of my plugins are now 'now available', see screenshot

Is it an idea to make the Qt3 build dev version of QGIS something other the 3.99?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Argh. typo's

Talking about Python devs here.
99% of my plugins are now 'incompatible' with my QGIS version... (I meant 'NOT available')
But I see people also use 3.98 (see screenie), so proably just use 3.45 ?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Isn't that a/the intended strong incentive to make them QGIS 4 ready (ie.
support Qt6;  BTW https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/62361 should make plugins
without a maximum version, but Qt6 support available again; otherwise it is
considered as <3.99 otherwise).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New QEP: Customized Toolbars and Menus
Message-ID: <DAVIIPR68RAY.3P1NZWE55FXVW@oslandia.com>

Hi list!

We propose to add a way to create custom toolbars and custom menus to QGIS.

It will allow users to have their favorite tool buttons / menu items
grouped together in their own toolbars and menus.

See https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/343

Best regards

I guess you will also see that, running QGIS 3.99.0-Master (either Qt5 
or Qt6), the official plugins repository is "unavailable".

As explained in the issue report [1], it seems to me the issues are 
related to the PR "Make QGIS 2.99 compatible with 3.0 plugins by 
introducing PyQGIS API version" [2], which makes QGIS 3.99.0-Master 
behave like it was already QGIS 4.0 and thus:

- it considers incompatible all the Python core plugins, which doesn't 
have a max version tag (since in this case they are considered as being 
tagged with max version 3.99)

-  it considers incompatible all the already installed Python external 
plugins that are tagged with max version 3.99 or lower

- it tries to retrieve the plugins' list from the URL 
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=4.0 , which is 
obviously currently unavailable yet,
instead of https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.99 , 
which is correctly available. So it's not possible to install any 
external plugin from the official plugins repository.

Moreover, the plugin list retrieved from the official plugins repository 
server (and - it looks like - the plugins website, too) doesn't contain 
any information about the plugins compatibility with Qt6.

The info about the Qt6 compatibility of each plugin is currently only 
inside the plugin's metadata.txt file, so, even if the previous issues 
were not effective, a QGIS Qt6 user can be aware about the plugin's QT6 
compatibility only after actually downloading / installing the plugin...

It seems to me the PR [3] proposed by J?rgen only actually fixes the 
issue with core plugins.

Regards.

Andrea

Well, yes. But I did not mean the plugins I developed, but all plugins I use :-(
I do not have control over them (see screenie in earlier mail)
So to me it would be easiest to not use 3.99 yet for my local Qt5 builds.

Is it already possible to do the Qt6 build next to a Qt5 build in Debian Testing?
Last time I checked there was still libqwt not available for Qt6...

And I agree that some force to make plugins Qt6-compatible is needed...

So maybe best that I make a local edit?
