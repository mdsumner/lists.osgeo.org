Hi there! 
Does somebody have an example or snippet on how to use the "QgsGoogleMapsGeocoder" class from PyQGIS? 

I want to geocode a string using the method " geocodeString " but I don't undestand what is the qgis.core.QgsGeocoderContext class and how to use it. 

Thanks a lot.

Hi,

see 
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsGeocoderContext.html#qgis.core.QgsGeocoderContext

You can use it to define an area of interest and to specify 
transformation settings.

I guess this should work:

geocoder_context = 
QgsGeocoderContext(QgsProject.instance().transformContext())
geocoder = QgsGoogleMapsGeocoder(apiKey="foo")
for geocoder_result in geocoder.geocodeString("bar", geocoder_context):
 ? ? print(geocoder_result)

Cheers, Hannes

There is a repository labelled trixie (added recently), which however 
_cannot be installed on Debian trixie_. This is an alias of the Ubuntu 
testing repository.

It seems to be the practice that Ubuntu and Debian installs have shared 
repositories for some years, but they are different distributions built 
on different criteria and there is sufficient risk of incompatible 
packages to make it difficult to share a build between them.

It is also impossible to install Qgis LTR from your provided trixie 
repository, due to the same packaging issue with python3-sip.

Hi Raymond,

Could you please share more details about the process to reproduce that? Is
there any error message?
I have just checked adding a test feed, and it seems to be working fine.

Thanks for testing Lova.

My process is:

Opening:
https://feed.qgis.org/manage/add/

Filling out the form, using a geofence and not a language setting. 
(Check the attached screenshot.)

First I tried a period of 10+ days and thought that could be the 
problem, so later I tried with the default 10 day period. Then I
Submit and check the review and submit again in the next screen.

It's a bit annoying repeating this because of the geofence, which needs 
to be be redrawn every attempt (in a very tiny window. Maybe a wkt 
parser would be nice here, but that's a feature request! ;)

Btw, in the screenshot I forgot to add the image, but I did that later. 
Anyway, if information is missing I would expect some kind of error 
message, but I didn't get anything like that. If you want we can share 
screens and figure it out together.

Kind regards,
Raymond

Based on Raymond's screendump I just created a new item.

It looks ok now?

One thing I noted is that I got a message that the max number of days for an item to show is 10 days (the default value for the date range is set to that), and on the Raymond's  screenshot it is 21 days... Maybe this makes the item silently rejected?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Lova,

Richard and me figured out what is the problem. The content of a news 
item cannot be pasted, but only typed. I have created an issue:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed/issues/137

Kind regards,
Raymond

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Run specific tests on Github
Message-ID: <f5864a0e-8660-4129-8669-1c8d9cc4c56e@dev-gis.com>

Hello,

I assume that it is not possible for me to run a specific test on 
Github, to not have to wait for the whole
build and test run to finish after every new upload, correct?
I have encountered the phenomenon of a test failing on Github, but 
passing when I run it locally several times. Right now it happened with 
/test_qgseditwidgets.py/ for PR
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/62775


best wishes from Portugal,

Moritz Hackenberg

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Exact specification of the 3D Tiles support in
 QGIS?
Message-ID: <6c346aee-0e04-4f82-99ec-c65c7df9e6e0@wheregroup.com>

Howdy!

I am struggling with 3D Tiles in QGIS and wonder if someone could 
provide information as to which kinds of 3D Tiles exactly are supported.

For example:

  * 1.0? 1.1? Both?
  * Explicit or implicit tiling? Both?
  * EPSG:4979? EPSG:4978? Custom CRS?

I could get *none* of the 3D Tiles offered on 
https://3dtilesnederland.nl/3d-tilesets/ under "WGS 84" to show up in 
QGIS: 1.0 (b3dm) or 1.1 (glb), explicit or implicit tiling.

If you try different datasets from the "Amersfoort / RD New + NAP 
height" section there in the 1.0 Explicit column, some might work (e.g. 
Cesium ion Rotterdam Wilhelminakade ? Textured or "FME (Safe Software) 
Rotterdam Stadsdriehoek LoD2"), others won't (e.g. "pg2b3dm Amsterdam 
BAG v20231008" shows up misaligned and with gaps in 3D; "VCS (Virtual 
City Systems)?Rotterdam" or "pg2b3dm?Rotterdam Ommoord" do not show up 
at all).

Are there specific tile generators that are ideal for creating (big) 3D 
Tiles?datasets?for QGIS?

Cheers, Hannes

Hi Hannes

QGIS currently has partial support for 3D Tiles 1.0 and partial support for
3D Tiles 1.1.

In more detail:
- "b3dm" is supported, but "i3dm" / "pnts" / "cmpt" tile content is not
supported yet
- CRS: 3D Tiles spec generally expects data to be in EPSG:4978, see [1].
Other CRS may be specified in metadata in 3D Tiles 1.1, see [2] but we have
not seen it used much yet
- only explicit tiling is supported (implicit tiling is an addition in 3D
Tiles 1.1)
- from 3D Tiles 1.1, QGIS supports gltf 2.0 assets as tile content (in
addition to "b3dm") - because Google's 3D tiles use it

I remember I looked at those datasets when adding 3D Tiles support, but
there were a couple of issues:
- usage of custom CRS - this is not common in 3D Tiles, and the CRS is not
specified in the metadata. I _think_ other viewers like CesiumJS would also
fail to show such dataset, as this was only supported by their specific 3d
viewer
- usage of implicit tiling not yet supported in QGIS
- tiles that claim to be "b3dm" are actually composite ("cmpt") not yet
supported in QGIS

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Assessing support for STAC / Zarr feature
Message-ID: <825D3953-5401-45FB-9C11-25374A1A596E@sparkgeo.com>

Hi All,

I recently submitted a feature request (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/62838) to support Zarr as a cloud-optimised media type in QGIS core STAC. This feature is considered necessary for successful integration of the European Space Agency's (ESA's) new / upcoming Earth Observation Processor Framework (EOPF) STAC service with QGIS.

Our project currently has capacity to work on this feature and it is something that we want to contribute to the community. However I would like to assess support for the feature before committing development resources to the work. I would like to reduce the risk of wasted effort if we create a PR but then discover that the feature is not considered desirable by QGIS maintainers. As this is not a major or architectural change I did not think it warranted a QEP. I have read the change submission policy.

I would very much appreciate any indication of support - or otherwise - from the developer community on this feature. Any obvious red flags, missed opportunities, questions regarding our intent, etc. would be welcomed.

Thanks!

Hi Martin,

thank you so much, this helps a lot!

Would it alright if I added this information to 
https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_3d_tiles/3d_tiles.html#what-are-3d-tiles 
? Marketing-wise it would be a bit negative ("partial XX support" sounds 
worse than plain "3D Tiles support"), but I think for users it would be 
super helpful.

When you say "gltf 2.0 assets" this includes both text (.gltf) and 
binary (.glb) encodings, right?

Yeah it seems like there is a lot of "flavours" of 3D Tiles in addition 
to the standards. So confusing. D:

Pirmin's repo has been of great help already. I haven't had much luck 
with pg2b3dm but currently I am evaluating mago-3d-tiler fairly 
successfully and I will share my findings if they are worthy.

Cheers, Hannes

Thanks Nyall for the work and answer.
on the other two points,

- having some solution for the extremely slow sip build times on qt6

Martin, do you have an ETA for David's grant
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/338

- porting the ogc server ci to qt6
Alessandro, would that be something you'd be willing/would have time
ressources to take over since you worked a lot on the server in the
past?


it would be great if we can move all this forward so we can come
closer to a qgis 4.0.

I'd also would like to re ask if we should start preparing for a 1(x?)
month delay for the freeze? And remember that there are funding
available.

Cheers

Marco

I'm bad with ETAs, but a status update is certainly in order:

I've found the most straightforward way to build the bindings 
incrementally is to make each QGIS header into a Python module, since 
those can be built piecemeal without changes to SIP.

This necessitated some changes to sipify and minor fixes in the QGIS 
headers, since the current code was made with the assumption of all the 
files being effectively concatenated together. I also had to make some 
changes to SIP to either fix bugs or to make it more lenient when parsing.

Currently the binding code for QGIS core can be generated and I'm 
cleaning up some build errors in the generated C++. Sadly the clean 
build doesn't cache anything between modules, so it takes a couple 
hours. I've made a few changes to SIP to speed it up in general [0], but 
it looks like caching of imports is necessary to make the the build 
times reasonable.

SIP's not very amenable to such caching, since it mostly treats imports 
like fancy includes, but I think I've found a not-too-complex way to 
rework imports so that each module is only parsed once.

That would be indeed very useful - thanks for volunteering to add that :)

Correct - both text and binary encodings are supported. Essentially it is
support of 3DTILES_content_gltf extension.

(Note: EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing extension is not supported yet - that's kind
of equivalent of "i3dm" encoding into gltf)

Yeah there are some extensions, which eventually got adopted into 3D Tiles
1.1.

Cool - will be interesting to see what you can achieve!
By the way, Cesium ion has quite generous free tier and can generate 3D
tiles from lots of formats...

Hi all,

Nice to see the progress on the ci front, thanks Nyall.
The Qt6 packages for Windows and macOS are also ready to be tested as well
(thanks J?rgen).

I suspect many developers do most of their work with Qt5 (because it's more
efficient looking at the build times) and therefore most testing by core
developers and technical people is done on Qt5 builds.
One thing that could help is to change the default to BUILD_WITH_QT6 as
soon as possible and collect some low hanging fruits.

With the feature freeze less than 3 weeks in front of us and the release in
about two months, I think it's a good point to check if we are on track
with the timeline or if we want to consider an adjustment as pointed out by
Marco earlier in this thread.

Cheers
Matthias

With regards to the timeline question raised by Marco in this thread, I'd
like to add a +1 to the idea of postponing QGIS 4.0. At the very least, I
think we should make a conscious decision about it sooner than later :)

While we should all be very proud of the regular release interval
discipline we've shown in recent years, I think several factors warrant at
least seriously considering delaying QGIS 4.0.

Like Matthias, I believe the fact that a Qt6-based development environment
not adding a *considerable* amount of time spent building not having been
unlocked yet means most of our developers are still on Qt5. On my end, I
did try to switch to a Qt6-only development environment during the last
freeze period, only to find myself going back to Qt5 to retain an
acceptable build wait time. While we have had Qt6-based CI testing going on
for a while and being improved week after week, I would feel really
insecure shipping QGIS 4.0 with Qt6 libraries when most devs have not spent
a fair amount of time running Qt6 builds (both as part of their development
as well as mapping production environments). We're also a few weeks away
from bug fixing, and we risk entering it with developers still fixing bugs
against Qt5 libraries (because it's that much more efficient).

On top of what has been raised above, something less crucial but that is
still worth factoring in: we had a couple of interesting changes we wanted
to push into QGIS 4.0 which at the moment are increasingly at risk of not
making it into an October release date. For example, at this moment in
time, I'm certain the icons set revamp proposition can't be achieved in
time. It'd be good to hear the status of other important changes like the
welcome screen revamp.

Beyond that, thanks for the status updates and ongoing efforts to all
involved! Keen to hear what others have to say about this.

I'm also +1 to deferring QGIS 4.0 for one release cycle. (ie skip
October's release, and release 4.0 in February).

The CI port to Qt 6 is basically ready now (at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/62809). However -- there's still a
handful of tests which pass under Qt 5 which are skipped on the Qt 6
builds right now, and this makes me nervous. If we merged #62809 today
and moved exclusively to Qt 6 then we'll lose some test coverage. I'd
prefer to hold off merging #62809 until we can get these remaining
tests passing on the ubuntu qt6 builds.

Hopefully that's just a matter of days, not weeks!

Hello all,

my name is Manuele Pesenti, I work at Gter srl, the company that 
develops and maintains the QGIS plugin CDU Creator.

Until now, the technical maintenance of the plugin was carried out by a 
colleague who is no longer working at Gter.
For this reason, I have been asked to take over the role of maintainer 
on behalf of the company.

I would like to kindly ask if this message is sufficient for the Plugin 
Committee to update the maintainer information, or if you expect me to 
provide additional details/documentation for the process.

Thank you for your support,
Best regards

Manuele Pesenti

Dear Manuele,

I would suggest kindly asking the original plugin's author first to (1) add
you as a collaborator and (2) set you as a maintainer from the edit page:
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/<plugin_package_name>/update/. Otherwise,
a confirmation from the original author or at least the organisation is
required.

Best regards,
Lova Andriarimalala

Dear Lova,

thank you for your reply.
I have already contacted my former colleague (the current plugin 
maintainer) and asked her to update the setup and grant the correct 
permissions to my OSGeo ID.

In the meantime, if this process takes longer than expected, would it be 
acceptable for me to submit the request myself by sending an email 
directly from my company?s institutional account? If so, could you 
please let me know the correct address to which I should send the 
request?

Best regards,
Manuele Pesenti

Hi,

Regarding the current situation, I would also be in favor of postponing
the QGIS 4.0 release.

Regards,
Julien

Hi Lova
Thanks for this work. Love the Case Studies pgae and the upcoming Volunteer
Contributions page. Great ideas.

Great work on reorganising the Contact and Support page. I have put in an issue
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/issues/703>to suggest some phrasing -
but I will leave that up to you to decide what to do with it.

Kind regards
Em
