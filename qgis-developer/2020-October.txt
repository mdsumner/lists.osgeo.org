Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Tip: test a Pull Request for Windows users
Message-ID: <47104365-295b-cd7c-fe4f-74253fe22dca@duif.net>

Hi Devs/Users,

Not sure if I was the only ignorant one here :-)

But see: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/39081

After Even Rouault had fixed an issue, I build and tested the PR on my Linux machine.
BUT... the person from the issues then told me that it was possible to 'just download the artifact from the azure windows test suite and use that to test the PR'.

So for others (Windows) users: IF your issue is fixed and you want to test the fix yourself in an easy way by logging in in Github, and then get the artifact from the Windows azure test (at the PR), unzip/unpack it to disk and just run that version!!
No need to compile yourself, or wait for the nightly build to finish/be available.

I hope this is an eye-opener for others too (credits to @pathmapper !!)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi, 

Really nice - I didn't know about this either. Quite convenient!

Hi Richard,

Is that the MXE build?

If yes, it has nothing to do with Azure, it's cross-built in a Linux
Docker container using using github workflows and it has some
limitations (no Python is the most important one) but it's useful for
testing QGIS core/GUI changes if you don't need Python.

Kind regards

Ah, thanks for this correction, and yes, I know Linux is better :-) 

But more seriously; for Windows users wanting to help to test (non python) stuff, I think this is ubercool... And it was something I really was not aware of.
Thanks for setting this up Alessandro (saw your name popping up somewhere in the test)!!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] The virtual QgsRasterInterface block method is too
	slow
Message-ID: <a1bb4db0-f8cb-d7cf-6cd9-94ebff109211@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

A customer found that reading a lightweight GeoTIFF takes 1 second in 
QGIS Server needs less than 200 milliseconds.

With timer I found somethings strange around the virtual 
QgsRasterInterface block method and it's reimplation in QgsGdalProvider.
Here is part of my logs:

The qgsrasterinterator.cpp ligne 130 [1] tooks almost 300 times longer 
than it's reimplementation.

Do you know a way to enhance this ?

Hello I saw the discussion of the Georeferencer improvements from April. I
hope you don't mind if I revive it and chime in in case these improvements
are under consideration. I posted this as a  github issue
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/35051>  but maybe it'll get seen here. 
Great there are plans to work on the UI of Georeferencer. I did a lot of
georeferencing work in Arcmap 10.x years ago and have recently been doing
quite a bit of work in QGIS3 so I thought based on my experience with both i
would type up some of the aspects of QGIS Georeferencer I that think could
be modified for easier flow. Some of these are pretty basic (more basic than
what is proposed above) but still fall under the Feature Request category.

 1.   Allow rotating the original 90 deg in the Preview window (arcmap
allows this). I have to flip original and GCPs around in my mind every time
i move my eyes between the windows.I saw discussion of a preview mode in
Georeferencer in the main window and I think this would be a great. At the
very least allowing 90deg rotation would allow us to get the original closer
to the realworld orientation.I've tried rotating the originals in image
editor and this sometimes works. Better to support rotating inside
Georeferencer if possible. 
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/t387047/94373373-f4be6400-00b9-11eb-9d72-f19176dd442a.jpg> 
2. Auto-Filenaming of GCP.points file: In Georeferencer > Transform Settings
dialog the "Save GCP points" checkbox currently results in a GCP file called
output_filename.tif.points. However because the .points GCP file works with
the original scan file not the output_filename.tif. perhaps it is more
intuitive to have the checkbox "Save GCP points" auto-create a points file
called input_filename.tif.points. I guess the one good thing to the current
approach is the output points are linked to the step in georeferencing by
the filename. But the problem is one assumes they should be loaded along
with that file when in fact they were used to produce it.

3. File> Reset Georeferencer removes all the GCP points and the raster as
well. If I reload the raster the GCPs come back. How do i just remove all
the GCPs and start fresh with the same raster? (this may be a bug)
4.    As the original post suggests this work is occurring in the main map
window (good for smaller screens) and not in a separate window. A separate
window is optionally available in Arcmap.
5.  In Arcmap the GCP number is visible (consistently colored green and thin
font no label buffer like in Q), while the target GCP crosshair and label
are consistently red color.
    snapping result hover label showing what layer it is snapping to
    GCP Link table (docked) shows residual with X and Y separate as well as
transform type
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/t387047/94373677-c772b580-00bb-11eb-9bd6-26384319b900.jpg> 
6. What about Z values? In steep terrain the lack of Z will introduce great
distortions.
7. In Arcmap the georeferencer is doing realtime collinearity and
distribution tests whenever a new GCP is placed (as soon as 3 or more GCPs
have been placed). This warning pops up if all the GCPs are clustered or
along one edge
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/t387047/94373848-fc333c80-00bc-11eb-9089-fca124a9da83.jpg> 
The result is that Arcmap allows an iterative process. First place 4 GCPs
roughly around the perimeter to get the thing preview-positioned in the main
map window. Keep working carefully placing GCPs # 4-8 or more, then
investigate residuals and remove / relocate the GCPs with a high residual.
Related to this I recently typed up a QGIS Georeferencer + JOSM workflow on
the OSM wiki to help historical mappers to geolocate the excellent Sanborn
maps for OHM contributions. Thanks
Sanborn_Map_geoferencing for OpenHistoricalMap.org
<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Sanborn_Map_geoferencing>  
Thank you for this excellent Georef tool in QGIS so far. I've found that the
QGIS Georeferencer produces often cleaner GeoTIFF files than Arcmap -- kudos
team!

Hi Paolo,

Thank you for the notice, it's now up to date.

There is a cgi URL called on our side, to trigger the sync once, I
imagine, a new push of packages has been done.

We are migrating our infra, does someone know where I can change this
URL. I take a look on Osgeo4W website but fail to find where
this URL is configured.

Regards,
Julien

I'd caution against reading too much into the debug output timings. My
suggestion is to re-run the tests using hotspot
(https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot) as this will give much more useful
information about the bottlenecks.

I know this is an old thread, but FYI QGIS 3.16 brings new API hooks
to address this requirement.

See https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/39191

Thanks Nyall,

I have tested Hotspot and the result is interesting :
* 48.7% of the time is due to QgsRasterProjector::block that provide 
projected raster block
* 26.6% of the time is due to ProjectorData::srcRowCol that identify the 
source row col corresponding to the destination row col

Is some enhancement could e done here ?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Offline Editing plugin
Message-ID: <be8d947b-0e3e-58c0-0b90-4b02e7696ba0@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I had the chance to use a little bit the Offline Editing with a
"complex" project and data coming from a postgis DB.

* when syncing back the layers are not in the same groups as the
original project
* a lot of problems with the widgets (e.g. you loose a relation
reference layer - key map)
* enum data type are not maintained (knowing this data type is not part
of gpkg nor spatialite I was hoping for an automatic conversion to value
map or similar)

IMHO (but of course this is a personal opinion), QFieldSync makes the
same things, but better, even if you don't load the project into QField.

Other people experienced the same situation?

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Loading MySQL Layers
Message-ID: <7483cff401e659601777b25985f232e5@carto.net>

Hi, 

Are there still ways to load MySQL/MariaDB non-spatial or spatial tables
in QGIS master or recent versions? 

As far as I know, there is no native driver available, but also through
OGR it doesn't seem loadable anymore - I compiled MySQL Support into OGR
- but all I get in QGIS is: 

Any idea how I could load MySQL tables into QGIS - other than ODBC? 

Thanks,

Hi Andreas,

It almost a joke, but since you are familiar with Postgresql, you can
use MySQL foreign data wrapper. It is not a solution, but if you need
that data in QGIS, it is easier than compile GDAL.

Jorge

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to get a generated CRS from an Unknown CRS
Message-ID: <e2077d00-594e-6b26-6797-7689de2a0d21@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

We are facing a behavior we did not expect from QGIS Server regarding 
custom projections.

We are using Raster layer with a custom projection. This projection is 
well read and understanding by QGIS. The data are displayed at the right 
place with 'on-th-fly' CRS transformation. But the CRS is desribed by 
QGIS as an Unknown CRS and not as a Generated CRS.
In the XML project, the CRS is described with proj4 text and WKT but it 
does not have an authid with a USER authority.

And with QGIS Desktop and QGIS Server on Linux OS, sometimes the layer 
is loaded without any CRS. The layer properties dialog displayed an 
'invalid projection', even if the CRS is defined in the project and the 
layer has been well displyed before saving, closing and opening the project.

Here are my questions :
Is the auto generated CRS has been deactivated from QGIS ?
Is there a way to create a custom CRS from a layer CRS defined as 
unknown CRS ?

Regards,
René-Luc

This has been fixed recently for 3.16.

It's basically just a string issue -- instead of reading "Unknown CRS"
the text should be "Custom CRS". The CRS will still transform
correctly (as you've deduced).

I wasn't planning on it -- I don't think we should be introducing new
strings at this point of 3.10's lifecycle...

quite understandable, but 3.10 is LTR, and it is currently used in
thousands of server installations, so a bug like this can have an impact.

Hi Matteo


Yes I have experienced similar issues - often getting corrupted projects
when I try to round trip data. IMHO we should remove that plugin and point
people to QFieldSync or Mergin as better options for syncing to a device.

Thanks Nyall for your answer.

Is it really just a string issue ?
If the text is "Custom CRS",  will the CRS stored in the project (or in 
the datasource) never become "invalid projection" ?

I'm also +1 to remove the plugin. I'm also curious: how many people are
actually using the OfflineEditing plugin?

Hi devs,

QGIS-Documentation master build is failing due to "ModuleNotFoundError: No
module named 'qgis'" (see
https://travis-ci.org/github/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/builds/733643360#L2217)

So I wonder if there's any issue with the docker build.

BTW, going to the code repo readme, the docker build badge is
indicated as manual (I have no idea what that means) but the
associated URL points to a 404. Could be nice this is fixed. Thanks

Regards,

Harrissou

Maybe you can have a better idea about that, if you ask in the users
mailing list.

Dear Heikki, dear QGIS devs

Recently I had the need to select features based on polygon(s) from another
layer.
IMHO this is a functionality which comes pretty close to "Geoprocessing
Intersection". In ArcGIS this exists quite some time.
After desperately seeking around I stumbled upon this nice plugin "Select
Within" which mainly does the job and which exists since QGIS 1.8 or so.
=> Q1: Did I miss somethin in QGIS v3.10?
=> Q2: If no, are there any plans to integrate this functionality into core?

:Stefan

Hi,
Stefan, something like the "Select by location" algorithm [0]? I could find
mention of it in 2.6 docs [1] so not something new.

[0]
https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorselection.html#select-by-location
[1]
https://docs.qgis.org/2.6/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vector_selection_tools/selectbylocation.html

Regards,
Harrissou

Salut Harrissou,

Many thanks for the hint! My bad.

It's actually "Extract by location" what I'm looking for.

I somehow don't get the logic:
1. of the Vector menu tool names (Analysis, Research, Geoprocessing,
Geometry and Data management); and
2. the criteria, when a Geoprocessing algorithm is being shown in the menu
(like "Select by location"), and when not (Extract by location).

:Stefan

Matthias knows this situation better than me and will be able to
confirm, but QFieldSync calls the SAME code as the offline editing
plugin...!

It shouldn't -- you should be able to confirm this by checking the WKT
definition of the projection and ensuring that it hasn't changed.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgJWJUfoN5bx9Q679VCcsth4phfMJVwoKx-JQYnW4mZFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Please see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/197
for a proposal to perform an aggressive dependency bump following the
release of the QGIS 3.16 LTR version.

The build dependency versions for QGIS have not been raised in many
years, and as a consequence we are dragging around many thousands of
lines of duplicate code designed to work around older dependency
versions.

It is proposed that for QGIS 3.18 we perform an aggressive dependency
bump and remove support for many older, unsupported library versions.

Comments/feedback welcome!

Great you find what you were looking for.

I guess these are inherited from the old 1.x and 2.x Ftools/Gdal menus

>(like "Select by location"), and when not (Extract by location).

From memories, old tools of the Ftools were kept in the menus for coherence with previous versions. And new algs were added based on the assumption of their use by the vast majority.

Personally, I no longer use the vector/raster menus; all these functions are shortcuts to the Processing tools so better directly look at the Processing toolbox where more functions and a search box are available

waiting for Matthias answer then :)

But: if QFieldSync is already using the code of OfflineEditing then we
can let the API usage and remove the plugin GUI?

Cheers and thanks

Hi Harrissou,

I don't have any answer for that, but it is the SAME error I have on my
local machine with a compiled version (or even the installation from
package) of QGIS.

The only way for me to run the tests locally if using docker.

I'm taking advantages of your mail to raise this problem (again) :)

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Possibly -- I've personally never used the plugin and am not sure on
its use cases. But it's on the "death watch list" anyway, being a core
c++ plugin which isn't integrated into the rest of QGIS in any way (no
processing algorithm, etc)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Changelog maintenance
Message-ID: <CAK2KqicUuvDoDHgkA45WByPAic4GkVtHd+oNeQVKnqERoJQ1qA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings QGIS community,

With the release of 3.16 LTS around the corner, we are hoping to have the
changelog ready to publish at the time of release. The developers have been
hard at work implementing a wealth of new features, which of course makes
for a lot of new entries in the changelog which need some help getting
dressed up and "publication ready".

It would be great if some community members would like to get involved in
the changelog maintenance process. It is a great way to contribute to the
community without the need for highly specialised skills. The skills you
will need are:

- Strong command of the English language
- Decent writing ability
- Some basic understanding of the QGIS functionalities and changes you will
be describing...

Basically, the process entails taking the contents from Pull Requests of
features introduced by the developers and tidying up the entry into a more
publication friendly format suitable for end users.

We have detailed the workflow for changelog maintenance [1], which includes
a recording of our walkthrough of the changelog maintenance process from
kwakfest.

Of particular interest to those interested in partaking are the
conventions[2] used when editing changelog entries.

To get involved, you will need to sign up or have an account at the
changelog site[3] and contact myself or Tim Sutton in order to get edit
permissions for the changelog entries.

The more eyes we have going over these entries, the less likely it is that
errors will be overlooked. Looking forward to hearing from you all.

Emails and queries can be directed to charles[at]kartoza.com

the functionalities, especially if already used by other tools, are
great and should be maintained, and possibly enhanced.

A good syncing tool is essential to have

Cheers!

there are a number of valid user cases, e.g. working offline for field
work, or distributing a project to coworkers without possible access to
db, etc.

Except for some tools which are only accessible from those menus, like
"Raster Calculator" and "Align rasters" and some core plugins, like
"Topology Checker", "Geometry Checker", "Georeferencer"... but these are
also accessible via toolbar buttons.

Hi Andrea,

Yes, of course Andreas. I should have said that I no longer use these menus
to access Processing tools.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GRASS, SAGA processing algs not loading
Message-ID: <CAES-DZQWWu2EDmc6ifRmy2mQJcp6nUE=8+HSfuMQQ3kGjZynuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

So I switched to Fedora 32 on my new desktop instead of Ubuntu and got QGIS
building easily enough but when I run it there seems to be an issue with
loading non-QGIS native processing algs (the QGIS native ones load and work
fine).


Background (skip down to question below if you just want to know what my
question is):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I  also  get a lot of 'Invalid algorithm id' messages when QGIS starts (see
app output listing below). I have grass and SAGA installed and their dev
libraries installed and set the GRASS7_PREFIX in cmake. I kept rough notes
of my setup process here:

https://gist.github.com/timlinux/7a8b77f01593a2875443933fd9d90c90

I can see the grass libraries are being built:

[timlinux at glade grass]$ pwd
/home/timlinux/dev/cpp/QGIS-Debug-Build/output/lib/qgis/grass
[timlinux at glade grass]$ ls
bin  modules
[timlinux at glade grass]$ ls bin/
qgis.g.browser7
[timlinux at glade grass]$ ls modules/
qgis.d.rast7  qgis.g.info7  qgis.r.in7  qgis.v.in7


And the GRASS provider is built:

[timlinux at glade plugins]$ ls *grass*
libgrassplugin7.so  libgrassprovider7.so  libgrassrasterprovider7.so
 libqgisgrass7.so  libqgisgrass7.so.3.15.0


I have checked the Settings -> Options -> Processing -> Providers and no
providers are available there.

Question:
-------------

Does anyone have any suggestions of what else to check to see why the
GRASS, SAGA (and ultimately I would like to have OTB too) algs are not
available. Perhaps someone could share their CMakeCache.txt privately with
me if you have all of these working so that I can compare it to mine?


Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Thank you very much. That is perfect. When we move to a new version I can
use it.
Now the Police of the Czech Republic is on 3.12 version.
I use the way that you have posted, so the QGIS can not be closed by the
cross button, but may be closed by Ctrl+Q.
We will migrate after the pilot phase  that should end in April 2021.

Thanks for your input... Unfortunately the project we had in mind at
Lutra did not materialize in the end. But maybe someone else would
pick this up and implement some of the proposed georeferencer
improvements!

Hmm -- this is quite odd. I use Fedora 32 myself and have never had
issues like this, with no special configuration necessary...

Did it work before you enabled the GRASS plugin in cmake?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Need help troubleshooting Browser Panel freezing
	QGIS
Message-ID: <CACjCNZQgnKdqu_gK9jegjFOWbYOfMkg+j1=8ZGrbq1yw3-Bsbg@mail.gmail.com>

The Browser Panel hasn't worked for me for at least the past couple of
years (I'm on Windows 10). My best guess: this is related to my computer
being part of a Windows Domain. Seeing that DB Manager may be discontinued,
and several of its functionalities are being moved to the Browser Panel, I
tried to figure out what is wrong with it.

The problem manifests itself when I disconnect my laptop from the company
network: if the Browser Panel is enabled, QGIS would freeze 20-40 seconds
every minute or so during active use. I am pretty sure this is not limited
to my computer: I provide training to other staff, and they all have the
same problem (both OSGeo4W-advanced and standalone installations).

Note that the problem disappears if I remotely connect to my company's
network via VPN: it looks like QGIS Browser Panel (or Qt) is periodically
trying to query some resource(s) on the company's network, and gives up
after some time.

I ran QGIS with debug options, but I didn't see a clear pattern pointing to
the source of the problem. Any suggestions about what to do next to figure
out what's going on?

Here is a redacted log around the freeze episodes:

Have you tried a fresh user profile to see if the problem persists? This
should be a quick way to test if it's data connection or plugin related.

box are available

I've heard this before from power users which also prefer the command line
interface.

But it would be a pity for learners and for non-power users, if menus
become antiquated, neglected or "deprecated".

I would strongly vote for a redesign of the vector menus for the sake of
QGIS! .

And besides that, have a look in the Settings/Data Sources, there are some settings related to the way the browser scans for item (Basic or Full scan), please try out that one too... And if then still failing, create a good issue, with how to reproduce and versions of everything, your setup (is your profile on the network disks) etc? (though I realize that it is hard to see what is going one, but maybe you can do some remote desktop thing? Or s screencast?
Can you check/disable your virusscanners?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

(though I realize that it is hard to see what is going one, but maybe you can do some remote desktop thing? Or s screencast?

I **personally** neglect them because I never know in which submenu I will
find my tool, and with hundreds of tools, not ALL could decently be in the
main menus unless we want to get scrolling, confusing (and  useless?) menus.

I would strongly vote for a redesign of the vector menus for the sake of

Hey, I'm Fred... remember Las Palmas...:-)I've a big problem at the 
University of Toulon (Fr)

We are still on ubuntu 16.04 because Covid, and

Qgis 3.4 Madeira crashes when we try to install processing plugin!

An idea?

Best regards, thank you

No it hasn't ever worked on this PC since I installed Fedora (from my hand
built binary).

Hi Matteo,

I had opened an issue report to provide instructions on how to build the
doctest (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/6064). And I
just noticed (sorry!) that Alessandro provided some feedback (in substance,
"docker is the best route now").

regards,
Harrissou

Hi, 

Can QGIS 2.18 be built against GDAL 3.x? 

Thanks,

Hi all,
this is what it is produced:

SET standard_conforming_strings = OFF;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "public"."test_export" CASCADE;
DELETE FROM geometry_columns WHERE f_table_name = 'test_export' AND
f_table_schema = 'public';
BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE "public"."test_export" ( "ogc_fid" SERIAL, CONSTRAINT
"test_export_pk" PRIMARY KEY ("ogc_fid") );
SELECT
AddGeometryColumn('public','test_export','wkb_geometry',4326,'LINESTRING',2);
...

Why it is not using the modern syntax, with standard geom name

geom GEOMETRY(LineString, 4326));
?

All the best.

Andreas,

Hum, I guess it would build, although definitely not a vetted combination. I wouldn't expect 
datum transformations to work very well, since QGIS would be dependent on towgs84 
coming in PROJ.4 strings, and GDAL 3 / PROJ >= 6 will not populate that often now.

You might have to add
-DACCEPT_USE_OF_DEPRECATED_PROJ_API_H
in CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS to get QGIS to build against PROJ >= 6

You should check also which PROJ version your spatialite lib is linking to.

You might instead to choose the 'internal PROJ' trick (https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/
BuildingOnUnixGDAL25dev) to have only GDAL built against PROJ >= 6 and have the rest of 
the stack (spatialite, QGIS) still using PROJ 5

Hi Even, 

Thank you for your feedback. Then it is probably better to compile it
with the latest 2.x GDAL then. 

The background here is that QGIS 2.18 server is still faster (better
performance) than 3.x. For this reason we'd like to continue to use 2.18
until the performance problems are addressed in 3.x. We'll share our
benchmark results soon with the QGIS (Server) devs to better find out
where QGIS-Server 3 looses time and try to address the issues. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Is this through the standard right click layer - export functionality?
If so, the SQL is being created by GDAL, not QGIS, so this should be
raised as a GDAL ticket.

sorry I was unclear:

GDAL?

Yes, that is -- it's the exact same code as when you right click a
layer from a project.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Missing Changelog Features
Message-ID: <CAK2KqicsOM8ejKgkKYzeMuwiBFN9FyCkQNfNXXG=5jQJ5a5sfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings developers,

Totò graciously pointed out that PR #38025 was missing from the changelog
entries for 3.16 LTS

This happened because the feature label was not applied to the PR... At
this point I spend most of my time doing copy editing and not monitoring
the PR queue, so if a feature is not labelled as such it won't get labelled
for inclusion in the changelog.

I had a quick dig through the PR list and found a bunch of similar features:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/38448
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/38331
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/37593
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/37588

There's a lot of great functionality there that I think is important to
showcase and publish and it would be a shame if it fell through the cracks.
There may be others like this so if anybody finds any I missed please let
me know.

I would ask that those that have made PRs which introduce new features just
double check that their PRs are labelled with the "feature" label in
future, and that new features for 3.16 are labelled "Changelog" or
"ChangelogHarvested". Don't apply the changelog label yourself, just let me
know and I will do it.

@Nyall I noticed that you have introduced a lot of new features that jumped
straight from PR=>merged without the changelog label.

With how hard and fast you introduce new contributions I think it would be
folly for the changelog process to become a blocker for your work, so I
don't particularly have an issue with this sidestepping of the "usual"
process (PR=>feature label=>changelog label=>merge).

You also typically provide detailed descriptions of the feature so that's
not an issue for me, but if you could label your new features "Changelog"
when you merge them so that I can include them as a part of the standard
harvesting workflow I'd appreciate it.

I tried to go collect all of those that are merged which you have tagged as
"feature" for the next release and have added the following PRs to the
changelog list:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/38316
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/38651
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/38652
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/38654
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/38624
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/37958

If anyone has suggestions for improving the changelog maintenance workflow
please let me know. It's documented on
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Changelog-Workflows

I was fearing this to be really aggressive, but it seems that it will
mostly only impact "LTS", aka people that choose to run old software :-)

From the pkgsrc point of view, I don't see any problems.  We tend to be
slightly behind when there are reasons, but not to maintain versions
static for years.

I'm pretty sure you mean "proj 6 or later is ok" and "proj 5.x is NOT
ok" in which case that sounds good to me.  At this point it feels a bit
early to demand 7.   That said, I expect this to be the biggest issue in
practice.

For QT, I don't have any issue with 5.12 instead or even 5.15.  In
general I don't think what's available on LTS distributions should be
much of a guide, as LTS users should be using LTS qgis.

For compiler, C++17 is hard to parse into what it really means.  For
each C++nn, it seems that there are a number of language features and
that support for them comes in stages to gcc, so there are gcc versions
that mostly support the version, and then it takes a really recent gcc
to 100% support it.

I would like to see qgis be buidlable with gcc 7.   There is only one
thing in C++17 that isn't supported there:
  https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html

so if you mean "C++17, with the caveat that gcc 7 is usable"

For clang, it looks like clang 5 will be needed, whereas before 3.4 was
ok.:
  http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html


gcc 7 and clang 5 were both released in 2017, so that feels a bit
aggressive.

If you mean full-on C++17 and thus gcc 8 that ws released in 2018 and is
even more aggressive.

I am sensitive to compiler versions because upgrading a compiler in a
system is much harder than other things.   A system being released and
having a perhaps 3 year maintenance interval where people use it seems
reasonable - actually doing system upgrades is disruptive and people
often wait a bit to upgrade base, while keeping other things up to date,
even without intending to cross into LTS.

How much gain is there from allowing C++17, vs onlyC++14?  To me this is
the only questionable bump in terms of benefit/pain.

Message-ID: <CAETFtH=uPmGG9_EVzZSZ4t922yhVxkt5=VPANENNL-YqPcN4rQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there

Last week there was a discussion regarding the issues with the offline
editing plugin already.
One of the main problems with the projects created by the offline editing
functions are the layernames. They get the static suffix " (offline)". This
leads to issues with expressions or widgets like e.g. the value relation.

We thought about solving it by adding a parameter called suffix to the
function. This suffix should be " (offline)" by default.
But it gives Plugins like e.g. QFieldSync the possibility to pass an empty
suffix, what will keep the layername unchanged and would fix the issues in
the expressions and widgets. It would be completely backwards compatible
and would not have any influence on other parts of the code.

Would this Bugfix have a chance to be in the patch release 3.16.1?

Thanks for your feedback and cheers
Dave

This is perfectly acceptable -- feel free to open a PR for 3.16.0.
We've always allowed API revisions, refactoring, and code
optimisations during freeze.

(But it makes me think -- instead of the (offline) suffix used by
default, a nicer behaviour would be to instead leave the name
unchanged and show a new indicator icon representing "offline"
status!)

Sorry about this! I guess I'm a little confused by the responsibility

we deem as important to include in the changelog? Or is this a label

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Missing Changelog Features
In-Reply-To: <CAB28Asjcf4kTwvL77NaTq_jzWpd7=Qxperkz9hTYDXB4MvTeXA@mail.gmail.com>

Typically the workflow is that most days I'll loop through any pull
requests labelled "feature" and see if they describe the new functionality
well enough to produce a changelog entry. This will usually be over the
review period before merging, so if there is something outstanding or
unclear I can ask the developer for more information/ screenshots etc
before the PR gets merged.

The Changelog label indicates that an item is "ready to harvest" and I
generally only apply it to *open* PRs with the feature label, then I
harvest the closed PRs with the Changelog label applied.

In your case it's a bit different though because I think between yourself
and Matheiu you might often be ready to merge before I even see the PR
(being the ninja-wizards I know you to be), so if you want to merge a
new feature before it's been tagged for changelog inclusion just add the
"Changelog" label yourself rather than letting the changelog workflow
become a blocker. Then I'll change the label to "ChangelogHarvested" once I
pull it into the changelog.qgis.org system.

I think it would get a bit messy having everyone trying to tag and label
these entries though, so I think we make this the exception for core
maintainers rather than the rule for most developers.

Alternatively I could periodically go through merged PRs with the feature
label that haven't been labelled with Changelog or Changelog harvested.
It's just an extra manual step (and point of failure), but I'm happy to
take that on rather than add extra work for the core devs, so let me know
if you would prefer that.

Fortunately the workflow has worked for the majority of new features
anyway, so we should still be ready to publish on release day!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GPKG and FID -- can we fix this mess?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiErzZkL_CcnOP+u195bucYn6oA7jHHdzXNRj1xj=hPJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

(Linus Torvalds-style harsh truths incoming, read only after coffee/alcohol!)

Having spent an incredibly frustrating day fighting with the
limitations of GPKG and the horrible workflow that they mandate, I'd
love to start brainstorming on how we can fix this.

While previous discussions have related to the GPKG sqlite wal mess,
that has (to the extent of my experience) been resolved in the latest
release. So I'd like to focus on what I see as the biggest pain point
of GPKG: the FID column.

This is a pain point for numerous reasons:

- The type constraint on the fid column makes it really hard to
translate datasets with an existing, non-numeric "fid" column into
geopackage. Eg. GML files often have a textual fid string, and
attempting to convert these to gpkg results in a string of errors
about string values not being usable as fid values, and an empty
result layer. The only workaround here is to translate first to an
alternative format (such as shp!), delete the fid column, and THEN
save as gpkg.

- The fid unique constraint, while understandable, results in a HUGE
raft of issues while working with these. It's SO easy to get a
situation where you have duplicate fids in an edit buffer, and no way
to save these features back to the gpkg. You get a series of 1000s of
errors about duplicate fid, and then an ambiguous state where you're
completely unsure exactly what's been saved and what's about to be
lost. This isn't just attributable to a single tool in QGIS -- it's
possible to end up with duplicate fids through so many different
operations, including really simple stuff like copying and pasting
features!

I've fought with this since we've really started to push GPKG and,
frankly, I've given up. I don't think there's any way to fix the
current situation and leave fids as they currently behave.

So what I propose is a radical re-think about how GPKG fids are
handled and exposed by QGIS (and by GDAL).

I propose that we

1. demote fids to being only a "semi-permanent" row identifier, with
the message being that "sometimes these WILL change and you can't rely
on them as a permanent id field for joins and row identification". If
users require a permanent unique identifier (i.e. a primary key) on
their table then THEY have to make and manage that themselves, just
like shapefiles etc.

2. expose fids as a read-only field. Users can still see them if they
want, but they cannot edit them.

3. make QGIS (or GDAL?) ALWAYS generate a completely new fid whenever
a row is changed or added. Throwaway the old value, make a new one on
EVERY edit/addition.

4 We COMPLETELY ignore any existing fid value set for features added
to a GPKG layer. I.e. in the case of translating a GML with a text fid
field, we completely ignore the incoming GML fid values and instead
use the "always generate a new fid" rule.

Yes, these changes will break existing workflows, and possibly break
existing tools/scripts. But honestly, in my experience and the
experience of my customers, there's a COMPLETE lack of faith and trust
in GPKG at this stage. EVERYONE has their horror stories of lost data
and mangled datasets. We've got to do something drastic, and we've got
to do it sooner rather than later to salvage what little hope does
remain for this format.

Thoughts?

What do you do exactly to get such issues ? If you open a GML file, you'll get a 'gml_id' string 
column, so when saving that to GPKG or whatever, you'll also get a regular 'gml_id' column. 
This has nothing to do with the GPKG fid column. Or do you do something to inject the 
content of the 'gml_id' into the GPKG 'fid' column ? I can't reproduce a problem with a plain 
ogr2ogr or Export/Save features as in QGIS (with default settings at least)

Isn't the main issue here that we expose the fid column as a regular QGIS field, instead of 
keeping it as the fid specific property of a QgsFeature, as it should probably have remained ? 
That's really the main specificity on how the GPKG format is handled in the OGR provider.

Why don't we just treat the fid as the regular FID returned by OGR for other drivers ?
I'm not familiar with the join fonctionnality in QGIS: but isn't there a way to use the 
QgsFeature.id() to do a join ? That could be a solution to have a permanent stable id. But if 
not, yes requiring users to create their own managed unique identifier would be 
understandable if they want to have control on the value of the identifier.

Sounds reasonable. But perhaps not exposing them as a column at all (and thus content that 
can be duplicated by error), and keeping it as the QgsFeature.id(), would be even more safer.

I'd be -1 on that, at least on the GDAL side. That would break an important and reasonable 
assumption of the format. That's how a row is identified... Why would we do that specifically 
on GPKG and not Postgres or other databases ?

To sum up my understanding of the problem: it seems to me that all the issues originate from 
exposing the OGRFeature.GetFID() content as a QGIS 'fid' column instead of just putting it in 
QgsFeature.id(). Otherwise we'd have problems with many other OGR formats. Maybe I'm 
missing something.

Well -- here's an example file:

Not sure how that file was created in the first place, but I've seen
many like it!

Yes, ideally. But at this stage we can't completely hide the fid field
without breaking existing QGIS projects. Breaking scripts is bad, but
breaking projects is a complete no-go!

That would also work, but we'd still need to expose these as an "fid"
attribute (for project compatibility, as noted above)

QgsFeature::id() isn't intended to be even semi-permanent. Just
"mostly constant for the duration of a single data provider's
lifetime" (i.e. a QGIS session). I don't think we can use it as a
permanent way of joining features.

Because, for fid at least, it's just an "internal detail" that we're
showing. To use the postgres analogy we don't manage internal record
identifiers with the returned features, just the actual exposed
columns themselves and leave the rest to the backend. And here I think
the backend (GDAL, or QGIS' OGR provider) should manage fids
transparently from the client (the QgsVectorLayer).

That's correct... but now we need to find a way to resolve this
situation without breaking existing projects. So (as noted above) I
think we still need to expose an "fid" column, but just ignore any
values in it for the purposes of saving records to the GPKG itself.

Ah ok, this is a GML2 file, which reports indeed a 'fid' field (comimg from 
the XML 'id' attribute). I was testing with GML3, which reports instead a 
'gml_id' field (coming from XML 'gml:id' attribute)

That issue seems independent from the others. Nothing in the GeoPackage spec 
mandates that the unique identifier should be called 'fid'. This is just the 
default value proposed by the driver, and it is tunable. Maybe changing it to 
'ogr_fid' or 'ogc_fid' as in other database-based drivers would make such 
collision less likely ? There might be some subtle impacts if users of 
GeoPackage or scripts expect the fid column to be called 'fid' and not 
something else.

Good point...

Interesting. But yes indeed, I can think of the QGIS WFS provider that will 
also return QgsFeature::id() that aren't stable (reloading the layer is 
probably sufficient to cause them to change)

Hum this is where things get really interesting. The PostgreSQL provider can 
expose a integer primary key as a regular column. So the sole fact of exposing 
a integer primary key as a regular column is not necessarily a recipee for 
disaster. There must be some important difference(s) that we must identify  
before jumping into conclusions.

One of the differences I can see is that the PostgreSQL provider allows to 
modify the value of the primary key column. Which isn't supported by 
OGR_L_SetFeature() (since OGR itself doesn't return the GPKG fid column as a 
OGR field, this is a QGIS only behaviour). So currently 
QgsOGRProvider::changeAttributeValues() will error out if you try to modify 
the content of the 'fid' column to a value different of QgsFeature.id())

I see the Postgres provider has some logic to have a feature id map in some 
cases (when the primary key cannot be mapped directly to a QGIS FID if I 
understand well), but for the GPKG case we aren't in that situation.

So, apart from the situation of changing the FID of an existing feature, at 
first sight, there doesn't seem to be that much difference between the GPKG 
situation and Postgres with a integer primary key that maps directly to a QGIS 
fid. Do I miss something (wouldn't be surprising. I skimmed quickly over the 
code), or is it just that difference that causes the mess?

Thanks, Nyall.

Such an icon would be nice anyway regardless if there is a suffix or not.
The default suffix should be (offline) to provide full backwards
compatibility. Of course modern plugins will not use any suffix then.

Cheers

wouldn't it be feasible to write a simple utility to upgrade existing

Message-ID: <c1a000fa-ee7e-8fba-edf2-cf0ecee4d6fd@duif.net>

Hi,

Whenever I click on a (vector) feature from a table with say 6 columns, QGIS presents me a treview in the 'Identify Results' panel which shows me (for every feature) these blocks 'Derived' and 'Actions'.

When I click in a 'crowded place' in which a lot of features are returned, I can open all leaves in the tree(view) but then my sight is pretty polluted by all this (to me very not interesting) facts about where I clicked and to see that I have one (View feature form) Action (I never use).

Are others 'seeing' this also as an usability issue?
Or am I missing a setting somewhere?

Would it be an idea (feature request) to maybe add an option (like the checkbox in the little tool-button menu there), with an option "Hide Derived and Actions"?

Or am I the only one which does never used this xtra info?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I find "derived" quite useful. You can immediately see things like area and
perimeter of the feature, even if there's no field with that information.

Yet, a option to disable it is ok for me.

Hi, 

Maybe introduce an "Action" to show "Derived" stuff ;-) just kidding. 

Honestly, I also hardly ever use the "Derived stuff" and I also find it
annoying that the "Derived" stuff is so prominent, even before the
attributes. 

But if they are hidden in folded state below the attributes, they
wouldn't bother me much. So could we perhaps place "Derived" after the
attributes? 

In the toolbar of the "Identify Results" panel there is already a button
for "Identify Settings". Perhaps we can add another setting here to
toggle the display of "Derived Properties"?

Yes, exactly *that* I am proposing...

I even think I can do this myself, just want to poll if I maybe was the only one annoyed :-)

Hi Richard,

I'm constantly testing OGC services/datasets and querying, and am 
(quietly) constantly annoyed at the "Derived" results flooding the 
results panel.  I would strongly (or quietly again ha) support a toggle 
enhancement, as you proposed.  A great enhancement.  Thanks for bringing 
this up Richard.

That's definitely not simple ... there's so many parts of a QGIS
project which could potential reference a field from a layer, and even
if we caught them all it would be extremely tricky to work out what to
change them to...

I think this is a great idea -- we could retain any compliant fid
values without change, but as soon as we hit a duplicate fid or
non-integer fid value then we discard it and generate a new one.

What do you think Even?

Thanks Nyall for raising this again,

The way I see it, fid can be seen very similarly to rowid or shapefile
fids. A semi-stable unique identifier. Just - and that's the big difference
- those are not part of the data hence the system can transparently deal
with duplicates and can fill holes once in a while (shp -> repack, sqlite
rowid -> vacuum).

If I could choose I would just make fids disappear (not only from the
interface but from all the gpkg implementation). And replace it with rowid
if there's a good reason for it (which I still fail to see).
So just to have brought up the idea: Could we make fids optional for newly
created gpkgs. Or is my fear that this will affect interoperability in a
bad way correct?

Matthias

Message-ID: <CAB2ZMRC=iuhDMhKHTLZeyM92=PJb99NSOMgEcUbXUQN9Piq2Xg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear community,

I hope you are doing well in these special times.

As you probably know, building and packaging QGIS for windows is connected
with a bigger workload than all other platforms. Especially when updating
the complete dependencies stack (Qt, GDAL, GEOS, psql,...), this becomes a
mammoth task that Jurgen takes care of. Now double the architectures, and
he gets double the fun...


Based on the user survey, discussions with key developer/users and trend
observations, we decided to phase out 32-bit support on Windows.


tl;dr QGIS will drop 32-bit support on Windows after the QGIS 3.16 release
when we update our Qt dependencies to Qt 5.15.

The Plan

QGIS will drop 32-bit Windows support in the next few months. QGIS 3.16 LTR
will still be available for 32-bit systems. 32-bit support will be dropped
during the process of updating Qt to version 5.15. Due to the complexity of
the involved tasks, there is no fixed date for when this update will happen.

Reasoning

Over the last years, pretty much all new computers (including low-end
machines) have been built with 64-bit processors. Our latest QGIS user
survey (http://blog.qgis.org/2020/04/02/ltr-usage-survey/) confirmed that
this move to 64-bit had been almost completed on the hardware side, and
only 7% of survey respondents indicated that they are still using 32-bit.
Therefore, we have decided to phase out 32-bit support in QGIS since we
have many libraries to update in the next months and we have only limited
resources.

Further roadmap

The update to Qt 5.15 is an important step towards staying in sync with Qt
developments. Qt 5.15 is the minimum version that will provide forward
compatibility with Qt 6. By updating to 5.15, we, therefore, ensure that
QGIS is future proof.

I wish you a great end of the week and look forward to seeing you on
October 30th at the QHackFriday where I'll join Tim in an AMA :)

Cheers Marco

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] refresh conditional formatting full row after
 feature attribut update
Message-ID: <D2417C80A342B246BEAF2C90A301E0AF772A1C3D@MailNT.vogelwarte.ch>

Hi

I execute the following code:

                        selected_feature = layer.selectedFeatures()
                        layer.startEditing()
                        for feature in selected_feature:
                            feature["focus"] = 1
                            layer.updateFeature(feature)

                        layer.commitChanges()

The update of the values works  fine, the opened attribute table shows the new attribute values but the conditional formatting in the attribute table (full row) is not applied to the updated features if only one feature is selected. If selected_features contains several features, the conditional formatting works except for the first selected feature, so it is not correct.

The refresh of conditional formatting works perfectly if the conditional formatting is field based (rule un field focus). The full row conditional formatting is only applied correctly if I close and reopen the attribute table. Is this a bug in full row based conditional formatting or do I have to use another method to update the attributes? Exist a workaround to force the refresh of conditional formatting full row rules on a opened attribute table?

Thanks for your help in advance
Guido

Are you talking about the addFeatures() method of the provider ?

That would be a provider-level change I guess ? Why not, but I'm still puzzled 
why we need something in the GPKG case and not with PostgreSQL with a integer 
primary key.
One difference I see is that in the GPKG case, when creating features through 
the GUI, I can set a new feature to a fid value already taken, whereas if I 
try to do the same with a Postgres layer, the GUI prevents me from doing that. 
There must be some extra hint that the Postgres provider provides, and GPKG 
does not.
(I can even see that in the same edit session If I try to create 2 features 
with the same fid value with a Postgres layer, the GUI prevents me from doing 
that, so before trying any INSERT)

Hum, one difference I can see is that QgsOgrProvider::skipConstraintCheck() 
does not take into account providerProperty( EvaluateDefaultValues, false )  
whereas QgsPostgresProvider::skipConstraintCheck() does. And in the
QgsOgrProvider::skipConstraintCheck() case, for the fid column, the return of 
the method will be true ( mDefaultValues being equal to tr( "Autogenerate" ), 
so not empty )

Interestingly, putting the same implementation as the postgres provider makes 
GPKG behave as it for the scenarios presented above !
Let's see how CI likes that:

Well, no, a fid is by definition a identifier. Something that must be stable 
ideally. In the shp or sqlite with rowid, this is not a genuine fid.
If you claim to have a fid, this is something you could use to do joins or 
create foreign keys upon. It shouldn't change after database recompaction.

Really, it looks to me "only" to be an implementation issue on our side. The 
concept of having a fid column is not something horrific per se. Many other 
databases have one !

You would create non-standard compliant GeoPackage. They would fail the OGC 
compliance testing and probably might be rejected by other implementations, 
which would defeat the purpose of being an exchange format.

Hum actually digging further, you would break even QGIS itself when using a 
spatial index. The triggers that update the RTree need a fid column. So if you 
used rowid instead and do a VACCUUM, you would break the spatial index (the 
RTree nodes would refer to other rows than the ones it has been built 
upon...).

Two questions from a packaging viewpoint (I help maintain the qgis entry
in pkgsrc):

  I am guessing that this "dropping 32-bit on Windows" is mostly if not
  entirely about project-built binaries, and does not mean that the
  source code will stop compiling on various CPU architectures.   I
  would expect a continued notion that qgis source code should not make
  assumptions about CPU architecture.

  I don't quite follow "update our dependencies to Qt 5.15".  This seems
  to be tied to Windows packaging in the announcement, but I think it's
  about declaring a requirement of 5.15 for building the source code,
  and then modifying the source code to use 5.15 interfaces and not use
  any deprecated interfaces, so that the code will be buildable also
  with Qt 6, which promises to supporting building any code which builds
  against 5.15 without deprecation warnings.  Is that right?

Hi list,

I wonder if I am the only one observing this.
For some time, when opening a project, I observed that layers are
duplicated in the layer tree. Not all the time, but sometimes.
Also my layer tree gets reordered.

Have you observed this?
Is this reported already?

Any idea where it could come from? Bad layers fixing?

Cheers,
Denis

If there is a managed database where there has been a conscious decision to
have an integer id column (postgres case) and workflows are built around
this: filling the id on insert, building foreign keys against it etc, that
works just fine.

But if GeoPackage is used as a generic dataformat (typical Shapefile
replacement), requirements are different and workflows less managed. E.g.
The "simple" case of merging two datasets already poses the question what
to do with the two colliding fid attributes. Delete the original fid
columns and regenerate one. Or preserve both and generate a new one
(leading to fid, fid_1 and fid_2).

If we look at the fid attribute as part of the data (where we have foreign
keys pointing two etc) we want it to be preserved.
If we look at it as a purely internal technical id (for RTree management
etc) we don't care for it and can just regenerate and forget about it.

It looks as if we need to keep it as a technical id.
I like the idea to transparently generate it in addFeature.
I would also prefer to hide it away from the user and only leave it
available through $id. This would make it clear to users that it's for
internal use and no one would expect it to be preserved after a merge
operation. For backwards compatibility there could be a provider flag to
re-enable it.
I hope that makes sense.

As I like playing devil's advocate :-), one issue I can think of is : how can 
you know when you open a GeoPackage, possibly created by another software, if 
the integer primary key column is a technical one (that could perhaps be 
hidden), or a "real" one part of the data and intended to be user visible ? So 
we would need some user feedback... Or maybe more simply, for pure QGIS 
workflows, we could decide for a new value for the fid column name when we 
create a GPKG table, like "hidden_fid", and when opening such GeoPackage, 
decide to not expose it as a field. That could solve issues for GPKG created 
from now by QGIS, while still providing some backward compatibility. And 
people wanting to still have a visible fid, and ready to deal with possible 
annoyances, could overload this "hidden_fid" value with another value.

Wouldn't making the fid field read only and generated once upon insert solve
the issues?
Still, it will uniquely identify the feature for its lifetime in the
dataset.

Am I right in interpreting that this means the Windows packaging
improvements won't land till after 3.16 is released?

If so, is it at all possible to request that the GDAL package alone be
updated for 3.16 to the latest GDAL stable version? (Leaving proj and
all other dependencies as they are for now!). GDAL 3.1 includes some
really crucial fixes that our users/my customers are crying out for...

Sounds like a bug to me -- can you reproduce if you make changes from
the QGIS interface itself and without the python code?

Nyall



or do I have to use another method to update the attributes? Exist a
workaround to force the refresh of conditional formatting full row
rules on a opened attribute table?

Correct, QGIS can't know. I as a user have better chances. I was trying to
propose to pass this as a parameter to the data provider (as an option in
the add layer dialog). This is not necessarily easy to implement.

Or maybe more simply, for pure QGIS

This sounds like a simple while powerful solution.

The "simple" case of merging two datasets already poses the question what to do with the two colliding fid attributes. Delete the original fid columns and regenerate one. Or preserve both and generate a new one (leading to fid, fid_1 and fid_2).

I agree with Matthias here -- a table from a full enterprise level
database like Postgres or SQL server naturally lends itself to
stricter constraints on the features. Geopackage is not an enterprise
level database solution, so we should be forgiving here and just let
users do their work without imposing artificial constraints on them.

I don't think we should do that -- having them show in some
circumstances and not others will be confusing.

I'm ok with exposing it, but just being tolerant and automatically
handling constraint violations for the users.

Hello

If I start the edit session manually and edit the attribute, the conditional formatting full row rule are applied immediately, even before saving.

It seems like the refresh of the conditional formatting full row rule ignore the first or last feature-id of the modified features if the attributes are modified by python code.

I tried to find an API-method which forces the refresh of the conditional formatting row rules but I didn't find anything which works

Best regards
Guido

It looks like it.  I'm in the middle of the osgeo4w reboot, but I'm not sure if
I'll make it before the release.  Even if I do, there will be only very
limited time for testing, if any - so it's probably better to do the next
release as is and switch after (and drop 32bit completely for everything).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS crash in Settings menu if NOT in english
In-Reply-To: <474e4774-9e49-3a44-faa2-4a6ba5f22a3a@duif.net>
References: <474e4774-9e49-3a44-faa2-4a6ba5f22a3a@duif.net>

Yes - I have the same crash - I thought that I messed up my
self-compiled version - but apparently not. 

Whenever I switch to German, and then open the Settings menu: --> crash.


For switching back to English, I have to do it in an older version that
doesn't crash. 

Thanks for reporting this issue!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Help with QgsProcessingParameter
Message-ID: <DB8P192MB0791C2192037ADF13C03B56FA7030@DB8P192MB0791.EURP192.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi Devs,
I’m contributing to the FUSION/LDV plugin and I have a couple of newbie questions related to the I/O parameters in Python.


1. SELECT MULTIPLE INPUTS
I’m not a Pythonist (I can read it and only make copy-paste-wise modifications). Unfortunately, there's one thing I don't understand of the logic related to the input of multiple files: there should be the way to create a .txt file with a list in case more than one is selected...but I haven't been able to make it work. You can find an example in xyz2dtm :



self.addParameter(QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers(self.INPUT,

                                                       self.tr('XYZ files'),

                                                       QgsProcessing.TypeFile))

and then calling:

fileList = fusionUtils.layersToFile('xyzDataFiles.txt', self, parameters, self.INPUT, context)



arguments.append(fileList)



When trying this with other files (.las, .laz), the txt file is created but it remains empty. This could be quite a big thing for users instead of working on mega files or file-by-file, but I have no idea ho to deal with it.


2. GENERAL OUTPUT NAME WITHOUT EXTENSION
There are some tools (e.g. TreeSeg) that require just a general “file name” that will be applied to many different outputs.
If I set just a simple name (e.g. "test_output") it doesn’t run the algo and returns an error such as “invalid name”.
In order to “fix” this, the user has to enter any kind of extension (i.e. "test_output.csv" and FUSION will strip it out using the basename for all the exports it provides.


Any suggestion or best practice about dealing with such cases?

Thanks in advance as usual,

Nic

Given two layers, A and B, there are two cases of merge:
- B is inserted into A: A features keep their fid values, B features get a
new one on insert.
- A and B are inserted into C: Both A and B features get new fids on insert.

This is at least what I expect from an autogenerated, not null, unique
field.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Several notes from Building QGIS for Windows
Message-ID: <CABPxTToPw1vz+SNoih7uPCceWgweJf9yP2hntqrG2Q6TDtdYqw@mail.gmail.com>

I just tried building QGIS for the first time on Windows using the
instruction from here.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL.md#4142-compiling-qgis-with-msvc

I was able to successfully build it, but needed to make some modifications
from the instructions.

1. I can download this installer, but it ultimately fails.
Download the free (as in free beer) Community installer
https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/2/3/D23F4D0F-BA2D-4600-8725-6CCECEA05196/vs_community_ENU.exe

I had to log into a Microsoft account, locate the installer and then
download that package from there.

2. This command fails
git clone git://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git

it was resolved by
git clone https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Difference between QgsVectorFileWriter and
 QgsOgrProvider when creating gpkg?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiMNuPiOgE430F-vwo0Hqo1fE+eZ=U-geA10ZZx-pp8hw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

After watching Tim's recent screencast where extracting nodes to a
geopackage took forever, I've tracked down a strange thing, which I
can't explain!

We have two different ways of creating a Geopackage in QGIS:

1. Via QgsVectorFileWriter, which is the generic class for creation of
disk based vector files
2. Via QgsVectorLayerExporter, which uses the standard vector data
providers to allow creation of new layers for any provider. (Used by
Processing in the screencast when Tim selected the "save to
geopackage" option)

That's fine, both classes exist for a reason.

But I've just discovered that using QgsVectorFileWriter to save a
layer to a GPKG is MUCH MUCH faster than QgsVectorLayerExporter, and
I'm at a loss to explain why.

The main difference I see when profiling comes down to the speed of
the call to OGRGeoPackageTableLayer::ICreateFeature.

Via QgsVectorLayerExporter, I can see that the sqllite3_step call used
by ICreateFeature spends a huge amount of time in rtreeUpdate. I don't
see ANY call to rtreeUpdate from the sqlite3_step call made by
ICreateFeature when QgsVectorFileWriter is used to create the
geopackage.

But I can't explain this. In both cases the resultant gpkg has a
spatial index. Does anyone know why one of the methods is so much
slower than the other? (And ultimately, can we fix
QgsVectorLayerExporter so it uses the same fast approach!)

Note that I haven't given this more than unit testing, but given what you 
mentionned, I'm rather confident this should fix the issue.

Thanks Even!

Just for my own curiosity, is there some logic in GDAL which defers
the spatial index creation on the immediate first use of a newly
created geopackage layer?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Build QGIS with MXE
Message-ID: <CABWZyyp5GYxEVWz0rEmh79k4SaJaop5400dxNY4PrVYDz_MFww@mail.gmail.com>

HI
I have followed the instructions on how to build QGIS with MXE.
I have all the dependencies build via MXE

I have changed the ms-windows/mxe/build-mxe.sh file to point the the MXE
folder
I have also changed the TARGET value, to the one I used in the MXE
settings.mk file.
I have checked out the release-3_10 branch of the QGIS repo

When running the ms-windows/mxe/build-mxe.sh from within the QGIS folder I
get the following error, the error output us in the file attached.
Also attached I the modified_build-mxe.sh file.
In the error output it shows that it try to use the following for a C
compiler
"/home/theuns/work/mxe/mxe/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared-gcc"
and it fails with the error:
ccache: error: Could not find compiler "x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared-gcc" in
PATH

I executed the command
/home/theuns/work/mxe/mxe/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared-gcc
in the same terminal and got the same result, "ccache: error: Could not
find compiler "x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared-gcc" in PATH".
I have checked the symbolic link
to /home/theuns/work/mxe/mxe/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared-gcc
and it looks fine, with executable rights and links to
/home/theuns/work/mxe/mxe/.ccache/bin/ccache
Please help, what can do to resolve this?
I am using Ubuntu 20.04.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to save a DXF 3D using pyQgis ?
Message-ID: <CAFF9Zhu1ddm=EWX=rpbV12AhbQ6POV-hXYRfDVnPKeSByBup4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening to all,

as in object,  there is a way to save a DXF from a 3D polygon layer, using
pyQgis ?

I am using:

QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormat(layer, file, "UTF-8", crsCrs,
"DXF", overrideGeometryType=QgsWkbTypes.PolygonZ,skipAttributeCreation=True)

but (also it works with other file types) the option "overrideGeometryType"
seems to be irrilevant with DXF, and it saves in 2D.

Someone can help me to discover the correct syntax ?

Thank you in advance

Roberto

This isn't a GDAL core mechanism (since GDAL has no abstraction for a spatial 
index), but a possibly per-driver optimization. Which is implemented in the 
GPKG driver. On a freshly new created GeoPackage layer (if you don't close and 
reopen the dataset), the spatial index creation will be deferred until the 
first call of GetNextFeature() or SyncToDisk() (which will happen if you close 
the dataset or run ExecuteSQL()).

For the update/append scenario to an existing table, one thing that can help 
is to run "PRAGMA synchronous = OFF". For a freshly new created database, 
PRAGMA synchronous = OFF is executed, which avoids fsync() calls. This is OK 
for a new database as there's no prior existing data that could be corrupted 
if things go wrong. For an existing one, PRAGMA synchronous = OFF would be 
more risky (that said, according to https://www.sqlite.org/
pragma.html#pragma_synchronous, QGIS crashing would still be OK w.r.t data 
integrity, but not if the operating system crashes or computer is halted in a 
unclean way). From a test on a 2 GB file appended into another one of the same 
size, on a system with a rather slow rotational disk, PRAGMA synchronous = OFF 
makes ogr2ogr -append run 4 times faster.

Another improvement is to defer the update of the spatial index when appending 
features. I've implemented it in
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/3079. It can make append time to be divided 
by 1.5  when inserting features in large batch within transactions (with 
synchronous = OFF enabled, otherwise I'm not patient enough :-))

Ok, makes sense. Thanks for the explanation!

Wow, great! So now Tim's screencast has directgly lead to a bunch of

Message-ID: <716372d5-0d1e-01b9-a7a3-47785eb56220@tu-dortmund.de>

Hi there,

I know that QGIS has some approaches to support multiple CPUs, but most
of the processing tools and core functions are still running on the main
thread. For example, when starting multiple export jobs (one to GPKG,
one to FGB, one to PostgreSQL), each are sharing a single core.

That's nice when you have a modern CPU, like Zen3, which is optimized to
support this*, but if you're on a Xeon based server or workstation,
you're oftened doomed with slow 2.83 GHz cores.

I'm using a lame workaround from this, which also works for all other
non-parallel tools, like PHP, GDAL etc. I'm just starting my project in
a parallel QGIS and start the export job from there - and zoom: three
cores are used.

That's the same approach, ArcGIS does with their background process.
ArcGIS was single CPU for a long time. I think it was too hard to make
the core application work in parallel. The hack was to handle the
processing over to a background process. This background process was
also able to run in 64-bit, while the main app still was 32-bit.

Can't we do this in QGIS, too? A "background QGIS" without a GUI, just
doing the processing. Actually, this might be pretty similar to QGIS
server? Sure, there might be some problems like accessing temporary
layers, but can't memory addresses of these layers be shared to the
backgroup worker?

Best,
Tobias

*Technical background:
Intel uses large monolithic cores, which were able to provide high
single core performance with low latency in the past. But the problem is
that you get much less of it on a wafer and if something is exposed
wrong, you have high losses. AMD builds rather small cores with its own
caches. So many of them it on the wafer. The cores are connected in a
network. The only problem is that AMD single-core applications are
constantly moving back and forth between the cores to spread the wear
and heat. But of course, the cache and addition data has to be moved
over the network, too. In Zen3, AMD has optimized this communication.

We already do! Definitely for exporting vectors to other vector
formats everything is run in a background thread.

I'm curious to hear which version you're using, and what your exact workflow is.

You could also use QgsDxfExport, which exports a whole project.

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsDxfExport.html

Have a look at the tests for sample implementations:

Hi
No, I did not, I wanted to go the route, where I can build it with the
provided build-mxe.sh script in the repo.
This way I can do debug builds and also I can change compilers in MXE
itself, for different builds.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] simple raster not showing on qgis
Message-ID: <CAEDrt38gSNOrTV5EWdcjWxDZYiUeEYZVAkmL4Db4GfgSLNEGCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to load in QGIS the attached 24KB simple single byte raster (for
debugging gdal_calc.py)
It seems that it is valid, it has a non trivial histogram and it loads fine
in some picture viewers that I've tried, ms-paint, for instance.
But when I try to load it in QGIS (3.14 or 2.18) it seems as if the extent
is empty.
I zoom to extent and I see nothing, when I try to click on it with the
"Identify features" tool it shows nothing.
The histogram computed in QGIS also looks fine.

For clarity I didn't turn on automatically PRAGMA synchronous = OFF for 
existing databases.

For current GDAL version, this can be done by setting the 
OGR_SQLITE_SYNCHRONOUS configuration option to OFF.

And starting with GDAL 3.2, also as an open option of the GPKG driver:
"PRELUDE_STATEMENTS=PRAGMA synchronous = OFF" (to reduce the scope to a given 
file)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] repaint layertree/legend
Message-ID: <b88d5318-4910-d4d5-bd56-386a92b08d2e@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

I'm puzzled on how to force the LayerManger/Layertree to repaint itself (or parts).

Context: I'm trying to configure a layer via PyQGIS to be 'temporal enabled'. 
All goes well but the little 'Temporal'-indicator does not show up.

Using this to actually enable the layer:

l=iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
p=l.temporalProperties()
p.setMode(QgsVectorLayerTemporalProperties.ModeFeatureDateTimeInstantFromField)
p.setStartField('Time')
p.setDurationUnits(QgsUnitTypes.TemporalUnit.TemporalSeconds)
p.setFixedDuration(3600)
p.setIsActive(True) # OK

BUT: the little 'indicator' does not show up. I've tried to throw up some signals

#p.changed.emit() # does not update the Layer Panel
#v=iface.layerTreeView()
#v.update() # not working
#v.repaint() # noep
#v.currentLayerChanged.emit(l) # nothing
#QCoreApplication.processEvents() # nope nor working either

I have tried to get the actual indicator:
n=QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot().findLayer(l) # find QgsLayerTreeLayer
i=iface.layerTreeView().indicators(n)

but no repaint untill I actually click in the Layers panel..

So Question: is there some magic to let this TreeView (which it actually is) to repaint itself?

Which reminds me on an issue I had earlier: IF you change the filter of a layer (via PyQGIS) and that layer had a layer count, then the (visible) count was also not updated untill you clicked the legend.

I'm puzzled to what level I should repaint the widget: full of only one node or...

Any input appreciated.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

there is a refreshLayerLegend(QgsLayerTreeLayer) method which
refreshes the layer node.
That should show up the temporal indicator after activating.

Cool, yes, works!

node = QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot().findLayer(l) # find QgsLayerTreeLayer in QgsLayerTree
# could do some checking here :-)
iface.layerTreeView().model().refreshLayerLegend(node)

Thanks!

Hi

Confirmed here:

gdal_translate test_gdal_calc_py_9_1.tif -colorinterp red -of PNG test.png
- shows in QGIS
gdal_translate test_gdal_calc_py_9_1.tif -colorinterp red -of GTIFF
test.tif - doesn't show in QGIS

Probably best to open a ticket.

Regards

Tim

I agree. I do believe that when a new GPKG table is created, a sequence is
created for the FID column. When there are inserts done onto the table, the
next sequence value is given for that field. If this is the case, in QGIS
the FID field should be read-only. If you wish to hide it by default, that
is fine. Just make sure that it can be turned visible. With that said, the
quote above should happen. When copying and pasting features, the FID field
should be ignored and a new FID value given to the pasted feature. This is
what I expect with an auto-generated field.

To answer the original question about gml, a field-mapping option would be
nice when exporting features, allowing you to change the name of the output
fields if desired. Logic could be added to the data provider that when
creating a new GPKG layer, if a field name already exists named FID that
does not match the integer type and/or unique constraint, the new integer
primary key field is created named ogc_fid or something along those lines.
If the existing named field field is a unique integer field, that column can
be used. I'm not sure if a sequence can be initialized with a starting
value, but if it can, just set it to MAX(fid) + 1.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS from OSGeo4W crashes with latest update on
	NetCDF
Message-ID: <CAMCJChuaU2X8ua8J0bW33jmo0_piBp7YKXjv=qOWg-Ofwqf-=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Sorry about the cross posting but today, after the update of OSGeo4W to
qgis-dev 3.15.0-82, I get a QGIS crash both with qgis-dev, qgis-ltr-dev
3.10.10-3 and qgis-rel-dev 3.14.16-3.

I've only looked at Desktop updates and so I cannot say what libs were
updated at the same time.

The crash happens when I try to open some NetCDF file (for instance
http://mf2.ipma.pt/downloads/?latest=arome.2m.relative_humidity&region=PT2
) as raster file, as mesh layer or simply when I open a folder with a
NetCDF file inside Browser.

This is something like this one: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/21162

As it only happens with QGIS "-dev" versions, I believe it can be related
with GDAL 3.2.0dev, but I cannot say what version I had before this update,
maybe from one week or two ago.

Can someone reproduce?

Another issue with QGIS "-dev" versions is related to GRASS. I get this
error message on QGIS initialization, and then I cannot, for instance,
create a new mapset with GRASS Plugin:

GRASS init error: Problem in GRASS initialization, GRASS provider and
plugin will not work : Module built against version 8bcecc9a6 but trying to
use version d8fbd49af. You need to rebuild GRASS GIS or untangle multiple
installations.


I can open two different tickets, but I'm not certain about the right place
to open them.


Thanks!


Best regards,

Pedro Venâncio

Pedro,

Probably a netcdf lib related issue. I have a very fresh GDAL build (from yesterday’s master) and can access that file. Either from GDAL or GMT, but my nc lib has not been updated for some time (which is not so bad as nc has had a couple of issues in recent past).

But I do find something strange in that nc file. Mirone (Matlab independent nc loader) errors when trying to load it because of the  “Conventions” attribute and HDF-Explorer says it’s a “4-byte null-terminated ASCII string” when in fact that attribute has 6-bytes
“CF-1.5”

Hi Joaquim Luís,

This is an IPMA NetCDF, it was working before the update.

And I think it is in fact a HDF5 library version problem:

> gdalinfo AROME_OPER_001_FC_SP_PT2_025_RH_2-HTGL_2020102000.nc

Warning 1: Recode from UTF-8 to CP_ACP failed with the error: "Invalid
argument".
Warning! ***HDF5 library version mismatched error***
The HDF5 header files used to compile this application do not match
the version used by the HDF5 library to which this application is linked.
Data corruption or segmentation faults may occur if the application
continues.
This can happen when an application was compiled by one version of HDF5 but
linked with a different version of static or shared HDF5 library.
You should recompile the application or check your shared library related
settings such as 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'.
You can, at your own risk, disable this warning by setting the environment
variable 'HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK' to a value of '1'.
Setting it to 2 or higher will suppress the warning messages totally.

Yes, I know that and I also had crossed with that HDF error (nc and HDF libs must be in sync building) but that nc file clearly has its issues. Both Matlab and HDF-Explorer confirm that and even GDAL touches it. See

gdalinfo AROME_OPER_001_FC_SP_PT2_025_RH_2-HTGL_2020102000.nc
Warning 1: No UNIDATA NC_GLOBAL:Conventions attribute

Which is not true. The “Conventions” attribute it’s there but something is wrong with its string value (but not only “Conventions”, at least “long_name” suffers from the same).

Hi Joaquim Luís,

This is an IPMA NetCDF, it was working before the update.

And I think it is in fact a HDF5 library version problem:

> gdalinfo AROME_OPER_001_FC_SP_PT2_025_RH_2-HTGL_2020102000.nc

Warning 1: Recode from UTF-8 to CP_ACP failed with the error: "Invalid argument".
Warning! ***HDF5 library version mismatched error***
The HDF5 header files used to compile this application do not match
the version used by the HDF5 library to which this application is linked.
Data corruption or segmentation faults may occur if the application continues.
This can happen when an application was compiled by one version of HDF5 but
linked with a different version of static or shared HDF5 library.
You should recompile the application or check your shared library related
settings such as 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'.
You can, at your own risk, disable this warning by setting the environment
variable 'HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK' to a value of '1'.
Setting it to 2 or higher will suppress the warning messages totally.
Headers are 1.10.4, library is 1.10.5

Pedro,

Probably a netcdf lib related issue. I have a very fresh GDAL build (from yesterday’s master) and can access that file. Either from GDAL or GMT, but my nc lib has not been updated for some time (which is not so bad as nc has had a couple of issues in recent past).

Subject: [gdal-dev] QGIS from OSGeo4W crashes with latest update on NetCDF

Hi all,

Sorry about the cross posting but today, after the update of OSGeo4W to qgis-dev 3.15.0-82, I get a QGIS crash both with qgis-dev, qgis-ltr-dev 3.10.10-3 and qgis-rel-dev 3.14.16-3.

I've only looked at Desktop updates and so I cannot say what libs were updated at the same time.

The crash happens when I try to open some NetCDF file (for instance http://mf2.ipma.pt/downloads/?latest=arome.2m.relative_humidity&region=PT2 ) as raster file, as mesh layer or simply when I open a folder with a NetCDF file inside Browser.

This is something like this one: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/21162

As it only happens with QGIS "-dev" versions, I believe it can be related with GDAL 3.2.0dev, but I cannot say what version I had before this update, maybe from one week or two ago.

Can someone reproduce?

Another issue with QGIS "-dev" versions is related to GRASS. I get this error message on QGIS initialization, and then I cannot, for instance, create a new mapset with GRASS Plugin:


GRASS init error: Problem in GRASS initialization, GRASS provider and plugin will not work : Module built against version 8bcecc9a6 but trying to use version d8fbd49af. You need to rebuild GRASS GIS or untangle multiple installations.



I can open two different tickets, but I'm not certain about the right place to open them.



Thanks!



Best regards,

Pedro Venâncio

Jürgen told me that he has rebuilt the netCDF lib against the new HDF5 lib, so 
hopefully if you update your OSGeo4W install (to netcdf 4.6.2-2 I think), that 
should work now.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Possible QGIS enhancement
Message-ID: <CABPxTTrLoZ1BEe=1y5s92fqLxQ+XjKU_7RKMnfoKvtzbhRMPjw@mail.gmail.com>

I am taking a look at qgscoordinateformatter.cpp to possibly enhance it a
little to merge some of the Lat Lon Tools capabilities into core QGIS.  I
am considering trying to code this myself and learn how to support QGIS
better rather than just producing plugins. Here are a couple of things I
would propose and would like your thoughts. Incidentally, is there a better
forum for making proposals such as this or is this the proper place?

1. Add the flag FlagDegreesPadDegreesMinutesSeconds. Currently it
has FlagDegreesPadMinutesSeconds. Without this flag it will generate
something like 5°3'2.23". With the flag it generates  5°030'2.23". The
proposed new flag would produce  05°03'02.23" for latitude or
005°03'02.23" for a longitude.

2. Some organizations use a compressed DMS format notation so for
QgsCoordinateFormatter::Format add the following:
a. FormatDegreesMinutesSecondsCompressed or FormatDMSCompressed.
This produces something like 050302.23N or 0050302.23W
b. FormatDegreesMinutesCompressed or FormatDMCompressed.
This produces something like 0503.23N or 00503.23W
In this notation degrees, minutes, and seconds are padded fully which for
degrees means that a latitude is 2 digits and longitude is 3 digits.

Thanks,

Calvin

Dear Users of QGIS

Friday, 30 October 2020 is KwakFriday! What is 'KwakFriday' you may be
wondering to yourself? It is an initiative to replace the wonderful
community meetups we used to hold every six months when times were
different. Like our in-person meetings, the event is organised on a
principle of self-organisation and community participation.
------------------------------
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/QHF-October-2020#programme>Programme

   1. AMA With Marco Bernasocchi

Marco Bernasocchi (QGIS Project Chair) and I will be hosting a 2 hour AMA
(ask me anything) session. The session will be recorded so if you can't
watch live, you can still feel free to submit your QGIS brain teasers and
burning questions for Marco to answer (use this form to quickly share a
question: https://cloud.kartoza.com/apps/forms/7AMg9qXfEA8Rratk).

   1. QGIS Server Updates with Alessandro Pasotti

Alessandro Pasotti (QGIS Project Vice-Chair) will be showing off all the
fantastic new features in QGIS Server especially the new server landing
page, OGC API for Features (aka: WFS3) support and the standalone
development server.

   1. More may still be announced

See where to watch below for the link to the wiki page with session times
etc., additional sessions on the day may be announced there.

Hello I read with much interest your solution to this issue compiling Qgis
from source in Linux Ubuntu 20.04 and I adjusted paths for cmake to find
this QT3D cmake files but unfortunately when it goes through the compiling
process, the compiler cannot find a specific library which is part of
Qt3DExtras apparently and is called QPhongMaterial and compiling fails with
an error. Does anybody have any clue? For the record I have been able to
compile Qgis from source excluding the 3D feature...

Hi Giuseppe,

That's what I use in Ubuntu 20.04 (using local compiled GDAl and PROJ):

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_TESTING=FALSE -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF
-DWITH_SERVER=TRUE -DWITH_3D=TRUE
-DQt53DExtras_DIR=/home/jgr/dev/cpp/QGIS/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake/Qt53DExtras
-DQT5_3DEXTRA_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt53DExtras.so
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/jgr/dev/cpp/QGIS/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake
-DQT5_3DEXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/jgr/dev/cpp/QGIS/external/qt3dextra-headers
-DGDAL_CONFIG=/usr/local/bin/gdal-config
-DPROJ_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include
-DPROJ_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libproj.so ../QGIS

I hope it helps.

Regards,

Jorge

Hi all,
I noticed that some functions (I checked row_number) are present in the
field calculator, but absent from symbology and forms. Is there a reason
for this, or is it simply work to be done?
All the best.

GDAL was updated to 3.1.4rc2 and should be picked up by new builds.

Hi all,

I've got an issue only on a Travis test, but on my side with ubuntu,
everything is ok, and the test does not fail. Not very convenient to
debug...

Is there a way to run Travis locally, that will permit to speed up
debugging and avoid to pollute the offical Travis CI.

Hi Vincent,

The tests are running on Docker.

You basically just need to do what is done on Travis:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.ci/travis/linux/before_script.sh
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.ci/travis/linux/script.sh
If you strip down these 2 files, you should end up with 3-4 docker commands
to build the image, build QGIS and run the tests.

Another approach is to run Travis interactive debugging:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qgis-developer at lists.osgeo.org/msg44142.html
(not sure how up to date it is, and I found this approach to be a bit
cumbersome personally)

Best wishes,
Denis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Suggestion of a different perpendicularSegment
	geometry method
Message-ID: <98f1159c-d3ab-1796-7ce5-a825ba516100@gmx.de>

Dear developer colleagues,

I'm new to QGIS development and my cpp and git experience is a long
while ago. Yet I want to make the effort to contribute to this project
in return for using it for months.

During my python scripting I was missing a function that I created
for myself in python which I would need to split a polyline using
QgsGeometry.splitGeometry().

The function I want to contribute will create a perpendicular segment to
a given segment with it's center at a given point (the already available
function QgsGeometryUtils.perpendicularSegment doesn't fullfill that need)

I would suggest to add to the cpp code of QgsGeometryUtils. A good old
friend of mine and cpp expert will do the first code review once it's
finished before I do the PR.

I am already working on that function and its test. The header looks
like this:

/**
* \brief Create a perpendicular line segment to a given segment
* [segmentPoint1, segmentPoint2] with its center at centerPoint
* May be used to split geometries
* \param centerPoint Point where the center of the perpendicular should
* be located
* \param segmentPoint1 The segment's start point
* \param segmentPoint2 The segment's end point
* \returns A line (segment) centered in point p and perpendicular to
* segment [segmentPoint1, segmentPoint2]
*/

static QgsLineString perpendicularCenterSegment(  const QgsPoint &point,
const QgsPoint &segmentPoint1, const QgsPoint &segmentPoint2  ) SIP_HOLDGIL;

Any comments or did I even miss an already available
function for what I am suggesting?

Kind regards, Tobias

Hi Paolo,

These are only available in contexts where the function is used in a
table -- e.g. field calculator, layout attribute tables, etc. But they
aren't available outside of tables (for symbology, forms, etc) where
there aren't any concept of "rows" to number.

Hi,

I don't know if I'm writing at the wrong place...

I have 2 shapefiles and I want to do a "difference operation" (https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectoroverlay.html).

My issue is as follow: Even though I have a powerful computer, after 5 days the calculation is only at 5%.

My question: Is there a way to take advantage of the fact that I have 32 cores on my computer with QGIS to make this calculation? I don't understand why it is so slow.

Thank you for your help.

Guillaume

Hi Guillaume


 >My question: Is there a way to take advantage of the fact that I have 
32 cores on my computer with QGIS to make this calculation? I don't 
understand why it is so slow.


Yes, there is. Compile the code from the 
'processing_multithreaded_vector' branch in my repo 
(https://github.com/mhugent/QGIS/tree/processing_multithreaded_vector). 
It calculates the difference operation on multiple cores (see also 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/33365).


Regards,

Marco

Looks good to me! Some suggestions:
- instead of accepting QgsPoint values, consider making the arguments
plain doubles instead. (e.g. double segmentPoint1x, double
segmentPoint1y, etc). This makes the API more flexible because callers
who have QgsPointXY or some other input values don't need to do a
conversion to QgsPoint first.
- For the same reasons, consider making the method return 4 doubles
instead of a QgsLineString. E.g. add double& perpendicular1x SIP_OUT,
double &perpendicular1y SIP_OUT, double& perpendicular2x SIP_OUT,
double &perpendicular2y SIP_OUT. This again avoids the forced use of
QgsLineString, and will reap benefits if the function is called many
times and the caller does not need a QgsLineString object
- Do you need to add a "segment length" argument for controlling the
length of the perpendicular line generated?

Thanks for your explanation. I intended to use row_number in an
expression to set a default value for a data entry form, it seems a
valid user case to me. I solved the issue with max+1, anyway.

Hi Guillaume,

A 5% progress after 5 days still sounds extremely slow! That would take 
approximately 100 days to finish on 1 core, or 2 days (72 hours!) on 32 
cores.

I don't know how large or complicated these shapefiles are, but you 
might try to find the solution in another way.

- Make sure you are using indexes?
- Select non-overlapping shapes and delete them?
- Split the files in parts?
- Move to Postgis? (Am I allowed to suggest that here? ;) )

@Marco Shouldn't that code end up in QGIS or is it still in your repo 
for a reason?

Kind regards,
Raymond

I don't know the reason it was never merged. All the feedback has been 
addressed and the unit tests passed.

Hi list,

20.04, ubuntu pull down also gnome and Server-x!

I look at 'qgis-server' dependances with 'qpt-redepends' but 'gnome'

I just try now with a fresh Ubuntu server 20.04 VM.

Have someone same problems?

Thanks in advance.

Hi again!

At last I am able to reproduce the weird behavior of the text edit widget with numeric values, tested and found in QGIS 3.10.9 and 3.14.1 (locale DE_de, on Windows):

Steps taken: load a (PostGIS) layer, create an attribute form with the drag and drop designer, add a numeric field (should contain values that differ from 0.0 in order to see the effect) - the default widget will already be text, add this field again (and add this field again for a third time), save the settings/form, open the form.

Surprising result: each very first use of our field displays only a 0 [zero] instead of the value. Every following use then shows the correct numeric value!

Because the recurrence of fields in my case has been spread over different tabs and groups in the form, I did not recognize this at first. But moving a second - working - use of a field to the top of the form reveald, that the display error swapped accordingly!

This however also allows for a work around: add a tab or group at the very top of the form which holds (at least) all fields, that may appear multiple times in the form and supress its visibility with an expression, that is never true.

BTW, if the widget for the numeric field is changed, e.g. to range or unique values, the described display error does not occur.

All the Best
Thomas

Hi Walter,
I think you need to add the following options to avoid this giant package
pull.

apt-get install --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggest

While this might be a working solution, this might produce problems with 
dependencies needed by tools. Those won't get installed and might be 
missing later.

Perhaps it's better to split the packages into "headless" and "GUI", 
like the packagers of LibreOffice and others are doing it?

Debian based distributions are known to pull and bundle more than 
expected and mess with the system. That's one of the reasons, containers 
become popular more and more: all in one.

This was discussed before:

 https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2020-May/061276.html

TL;DR, it looks like Canonical did not want to support
notification-daemon and changed libnotify4 to have gnome-shell as
preferred dependency.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Thanks guys for the help.

I read the discussion, perhaps it'd be right add this indication into 
server install documentation ?

Hi Walter, 

Please test this first, and reassure yourself that all is working and there are no dependency issues.
If yes, then please yes, add it to the server install via a Pull Request in an ubuntu specific part.

Thanks,

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS why are people still running Ubuntu server if they can run Debian?

I'm testing it for a future course, if I don't find dependancy issues 
I'll do a PR on docs.

You are in right Richard, Debian is simple to install but Ubuntu server 
is easier for a not skilled person :)W

Good idea, we just did this in the Docker instructions at

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/server_manual/containerized_deployment.html

I'll propose a PR for the introduction part to mention this.

Message-ID: <39d5dc56-98c5-50f8-eaa0-b169a297aaf4@gmail.com>

Hi everyone

I am building the latest QGIS 3.16 in Linux openSUSE Tumbleweed. I am 
experiencing a problem I never seen before:

sip5: Unable to find file "QtXml/QtXmlmod.sip"

However, I know where in my system this file exists:

/usr/share/sip/PyQt5/QtXml/QtXmlmod.sip

My problem is that I do not understand how to tell ccmake where to find it.

Any hint is appreciated!

Thanks

Hernán

Message-ID: <2be0f680-9227-4348-047f-c7d8eef424f4@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Just building current dev (3.17) I see QGIS is unable to receive the plugins.xml for the plugins,
Not for 3.16 and not for 3.17

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.16
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.17

In the old plugins app I could ssh into the docker, and knew where to add something,
But now I'm a little lost :-(

Can somebody with plugins-app foo maybe add some symlinks/redirects/whatisneeded?

Thanks

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi All,

I (silently) incorporated the Visual Changelog for 3.16 into the site, so you devs can check for glitches:
https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog316/index.html

Please edit (or Pull Request) on the rst sources now, if you see something that can be made better:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/edit/master/source/site/forusers/visualchangelog316/index.rst

Thanks All for making this possible (specially Charles & Other Kartozians).

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS sources (to translate) will be uploaded to transifex when releases are actually available and the website is updated to reflect 3.16

hello thank you very much I followed your example and I will finally be able
to compile QGis with 3D this is what I used:
cmake ..
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/joe/Desktop/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake/Qt53DExtras 
-DQT5_3DEXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/joe/Desktop/external/qt3dextra-headers/Qt3DExtras
-DQT5_3DEXTRA_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt53DExtras.so
-DWITH_3D=TRUE

then ccmake .. options 
and then make clean & make -j4
and it worked

Hi Richard

Dimas will hopefully sort that out for use quickly tomorrow. I will get him
to add a little admin UI that lets us add a new version easily.

Message-ID: <1d44af40-0982-a2d7-22cd-d8c8e3179159@tu-dortmund.de>

Hi there,

could we please me the "greenish" QGIS icon to red, blue or something 
else to better differ stable vs. dev?

Since I've got both icons side by side in my Windows taskbar, I always 
have to remember what's the DEV one ;) So I've changed the icon manually 
to something else.

But maybe others also would profit from the change? It's a small change, 
which might help a lot ;)

Didn't we have a versions with a big 'DEV' in red over it?
Or is that an option to add that programmatically (during dev build)? Then we would just keep one nice green icon :-)

In the OSGeo4W-build, qgis-dev-bin.exe only has one icon (the normal 
"irish" one).

I am usually quite critical with design work, but have always been very
fond of the QGIS3 branding.

Although I agreed with the idea of a red "dev" indication over the existing
logo, I had wondered if there was a creative way I could tweak the logo for
differing version icons and actually have it work. I didn't have high
hopes, as it would have to check all three boxes for being pretty, being
unique/ distinguishable and also retain the QGIS identity.

After a quick experiment I have concluded that the "Irish" logo is the best
one and pretty much any and all modifications I performed were failures. If
you want to see the results I put it on imgur. Warning: it's not pretty.

I'm wondering if we should remove the "Feature: " prefix from these
entries. It seems a little redundant to me. I've not encountered a
duplication of a case sensitive match that I can recall (and I feel that it
would have stood out), so a simple find and replace with casing match
should work.

I don't know if I should go ahead and PR this or is someone attached to
these header prefixes?

Just for the record, the cause of this problem was that I had updated 
sip using pip a couple of weeks ago. The new installation messed of 
course with the system's installation. After uninstalling and 
reinstalling everything that had with sip to do, QGIS compiled just fine.

Hi

For me it is redundant to have the feature label for each entry. Happy to
remove it.

That's great!
However, I think that cases of "won't fix", "not a bug", "works ok for me"
etc. do not look nice in the Notable Fixes section.

Message-ID: <0eb10eae-c747-6107-0183-d3f8262a9cdb@libero.it>

Hi all,

i'm using QGIS version 3.10.11 and i have a problem with QGIS SERVER 
when i made a request of WFS service.

This is the request:

<SERVERURL>?MAXFEATURES=5&SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.1.0&REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=Layer1,Layer2&OUTPUTFORMAT=application/vnd.ogc.gml&SRSNAME=EPSG:3003&FILTER=<Filter

4851321.496171168</upperCorner></Envelope></BBOX></Filter>

The response is:

 1. <ServiceExceptionReportxmlns="http://www.opengis.net/ogc"version="1.2.0">
     1. <ServiceExceptioncode="RequestNotWellFormed">There has to be a
        1:1 mapping between each element in a TYPENAME and the FILTER
        list</ServiceException>
     2. </ServiceExceptionReport>

To get results i have to repeat the filter twice (or n-time if i have n 
layers)

<SERVERURL>?MAXFEATURES=5&SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.1.0&REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=Layer1,Layer2&OUTPUTFORMAT=application/vnd.ogc.gml&SRSNAME=EPSG:3003&FILTER=(<Filter

I don't remember in which version of QGIS SERVER the previous request 
run with no issue. Does it change something?

Thanks

I just upgraded from QGIS 3.10.8 to 3.10.11 and noticed that pywin32 is no
longer available. I develop a plugin for a client that uses win32clipboard
from pywin32 and would really rather not have the customer go through the
effort of installing it separately.

 

Any chance of getting it back, seeing how it is available in 3.10.8?

Hi Tim,

Did the machines/ip's change? Because I cannot log in into plugins.qgis.org

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.17 (for those running master (main?)) still has a 404.

See also: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/96/files

But I thought to start with a redirect fro 317 ->316 or so if that is easier.
But I connot login on that machine.. Or am I banned because I tried to many times?
Anybody else can login?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi there,
I'm creating a custom cpp application using QGis framework. Nowadays I'm
trying to get a map from map server using WMS protocol.
I've tried to use QgsWms* classes (QgsWmsCapabilitiesDownload etc.) in my
project but I came across with some linking problems. Is there any way to
use QgsWms* classes outside of the Qgis application? Any library including
those QgsWms* classes?

Details can be found on the following issue:

No: those classes are not part of public API, symbols are not exported.

Message-ID: <a7faa20b-93ed-8b21-7a47-f710a4c6d8cb@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

A build of a Docs PR of my [0] in which I try to open the world_map.gpkg is failing because:

Warning 4: Failed to open /usr/share/qgis/resources/data/world_map.gpkg: Permission denied.

In my local builds 

iface.addVectorLayer(os.path.join(QgsApplication.pkgDataPath(),'resources','data','world_map.gpkg|layername=Countries'), '', 'ogr')

just works.

But in Travis (and a global install) apparently the resources are not readable by a normal user.

What could be the best solution for that:
- add an install step which makes such resources available for users (and their plugins?)
- create code so the inbuilt: uri's would work (see [1])
iface.addVectorLayer('inbuilt:/data/world_map.gpkg|layername=countries', 'Countries', 'ogr')

Any input appreciated, Thanks,

Richard

I tried submitting my first QGIS core code submission. See

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/39655

As I was doing the pull request I found out that there were some scripts
that should have been run to check the coding style. Unfortunately, those
scripts are .sh scripts and I chose to develop on Windows using Visual
Studio and as far as I know there isn't a way to run the scripts.

I am on windows, but would I be better off to use something like virtualbox
and create a virtual linux development environment? I'm not as good with
linux because I haven't used it for over 10 years.

Is there still a way for me to use the Windows development environment, yet
make sure I'm able to run all the required scripts to do the checks?

How have you set up your QGIS development environment?

My code submission got a red flag with indentation so before I do anything
more I really need to figure out the best workflow for doing development.

Thanks,

Calvin

If I understand correctly, Windows 10 has a linux environment nowadays. No
idea how to use it though, I prefer to work on Linux directly.

Hi Calvin,

Disclaimer: I'm a Debian guy, and if I do cpp work, I mostly use the 'average' workflow: develop/compile/debug in QtCreator

Here is a lot of best practices:
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/

Your current main issue (now) is indentation, see

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/codingstandards.html#indentation
That is indeed: run the script 'scripts/prepare-commit.sh'

I would say, that IF you can make that script work on Windows (in one of those fancy 'Windows Subsystem for Linux' or so),
AND you are comfortable with what you have now, I would say: "stick to your plan". 
In my experience coding can be done by just coding/compiling and running that script :-) 
Sometimes running the tests may be a problem?

Others?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS but off course you are also invited to join the beautiful world called Debian Linux ;-)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Wrong results converting vectors to Float32 rasters
Message-ID: <CAMCJChu72DJVGx=reaZuHhtZj0PDB9vO1PAc-bHB0Q1L5XD91Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm seeing a weird behaviour when converting vectors to rasters.

I have a polygons layer with a "value" field that has 2 decimal places.

Converting it to raster with gdal_rasterize, the output is different if I
choose it as Float32 or Float64.

Here is a sample Project:
https://cld.pt/dl/download/61894ebd-ade0-4f12-8aa3-1405ab2690cc/Float_Issue_Project.zip

These are the commands I use (inside QGIS or in CLI):

gdal_rasterize -l polygons -a value -tr 5.0 5.0 -a_nodata 0.0 -te

Looking at output in Value Tool:

[image: image.jpeg]


So, if the conversion is to a Float64 raster, pixel values have 2 decimal
places, as the original data.
If the conversion is to a Float32 raster, several pixel values assume 16
decimal places.

Float32: 0.2199999988079071
Float64: 0.22
Original value: 0.22


Where this becomes a serious problem is when the values are used, for
instance, for a reclassification process (with Reclassify by Table).
Imagine these rules:

[0 - 0.22[ = 1
[0.22 - 0.5[ = 2
>= 0.5 = 3

Pixels 0.22 are reclassified as 2;
Pixels 0.2199999988079071 are reclassified as 1.

[image: image.jpeg]


So, Float64 gives the right results and Float32 gives wrong results.

But how can this be explained, if all input values can fall within both a
Float32 and Float64 range of values?

  Float32       -3.4E38           3.4E38
  Float64       -1.79E308         1.79E308


Even more strange is, if instead of gdal_rasterize I use OTB Rasterization,
no matter whether I use float (Float32) or double (Float64) dtype, I always
get wrong results, just like gdal_rasterize with Float32.

Should we change the default gdal output to Float64? Or is this a deeper
issue?

Thanks.

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Hi Pedro,
"decimal" to float (IEEE754) conversion is unlikely an exact conversion:

The most accurate representation of 0.22 in
float single precision (32 bit) is  0.2199999988079071044921875
float double precision (64 bit) is 0.220000000000000001110223024625

So probably the different behavior is due to the way GDAL or QGIS chose to
represent and handle these values using a finite number of decimal places
rounding/truncating at (so it seems) 16 digits:

0.2199999988079071044921875 becomes 0.2199999988079071 and
0.220000000000000001110223024625 becomes 0.22

Regards.

Andrea

OGC Geopackage Standards Working Group updates its Charter; public comment
requested

New purpose of SWG is to revise the GeoPackage Encoding Standard and revise
existing, or produce new, extensions to improve and increase functionality

Contact: info at ogc.org 

28 October 2020: The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) seeks public comment
on a revision of the Geopackage Standards Working Group (SWG) charter.
Comments are due by November 17, 2020.

The Geopackage Standards Working Group (SWG)
<http://mail.opengeospatial.org/lists/lt.php?tid=NGnV
+Zr16eyYm755FBLOnb7ffG4Y4EO/l8L4nqR9Hu6zd5oDuLpK8YGYOTtSnVIr>
provides a consensus forum for revisions to the GeoPackage Encoding
Standard including approved extensions as well as the development of new
GeoPackage extensions. The SWG adopted a new charter outlining plans for
future development of the Standard.

GeoPackage was originally developed with three main goals in mind: 

 To be a convenient, efficient, and interoperable container for geospatial
information; 
 To enable operations in all computing environments, including those with
Disconnected, Degraded, Intermittent, or Limited (DDIL) network
connectivity; 
 For GeoPackage to be extensible, allowing it to evolve to meet future
operational needs.

For a good primer on Geopackage please read the post entitled
#GeoPackageDay 2020 - what is GeoPackage?
<http://mail.opengeospatial.org/lists/lt.php?

tid=O9IqSsItS3CtsS4CsA24r77ffG4Y4CO/l8L4nqR9Hu6zd5oDuLpa8YGYOTtSnVIr>
.

The revised charter outlines the new objectives for the SWG:

 Develop a logical model for GeoPackage so that future implementations can
be separated from the current requirement to use SQLite.
 Revise existing GeoPackage standards and extensions, namely the GeoPackage
Encoding Standard 1.3.0, the GeoPackage Tiled Gridded Coverage Extension,
and the GeoPackage Related Tables Extension. In particular, the SWG will
review all outstanding Change Request Proposals submitted before the
adoption of this charter.
 Develop new GeoPackage extensions that have been requested by OGC Domain
Working Groups
<http://mail.opengeospatial.org/lists/lt.php?tid=aCkq2i/
EupWuWhjW8bVd3r7ffG4Y4DO/l8L4nqR9Hu6zd5oDuLpK8YGYOTtSnVIr>
.
 Perform outreach to promote GeoPackage understanding and use.

Revisions to the version 1.3.0 of the GeoPackage Encoding Standard will
improve the interoperability, capability, and clarity of the Standard. The
Tiled Gridded Coverage and Related Tables Extensions have not been revised
since their initial release and will likely benefit from additional review.
New extensions would enable new capabilities that have been requested by
the OGC community.

The Geopackage SWG plans to perform these activities by the end of calendar
year 2022.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Qt slot methods are not triggered
Message-ID: <CAN6+xQ--cC1DE+d6EtOC7y_awSBoBUbPB_wcxPDOMq=JsWvZKw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I have very simple plugin with button, list and status bar:
https://github.com/miloszpiglas/test_qgis_plugin. Button and list have
attached slot methods, which should be triggered on certain events.
But when I select item on list or click button nothing happens.

The same code works fine as standalone application.

What bothers me most is that when I uncomment line 41 slot methods are
triggered. Log message is printed and status bar is updated when I
click in list. Exception is thrown when button is pressed.

Any suggestion what I'm doing wrong will be appreciated ;)

Kind regards,
Milosz

Hi Andrea,

Thank you very much for pointing me in the right direction! Now I
understand why, for instance, 0.25 was converted to 0.25 both in Float32
and Float64. That was really strange for me.

No doubt that all come from the conversion of floating point numbers.

However, this can be really tricky and lead to wrong results in a
processing like I was talking about, with reclassifications or so.

Is there any workaround that can be used by QGIS / GDAL? Maybe an option to
the user specify the number of decimal places? If this is not possible,
maybe making Float64 as default could be safer?

Even, what do you think?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro

Message-ID: <CAMtsY+bN7CqToNV0VFxMdZfph2S-8OtTLkfjD+ZQkd8AR6OUDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a WFS-T layer with a Postgis DB behind it.
On my table, I have an insert trigger (before insert) which sets a field.
When I create a feature on this layer in QGIS, I don't get back the value
of this field (I have to refresh the data, by re-opening QGIS for instance).

Is this expected?
Is there anything we can fix?
Am I doing something wrong?

Many thanks

Denis

Yes. The features are locally cached in a SQLite layer and a newly
created feature will be stored locally and not retrieve from the
server.

> Is there anything we can fix?

Of course yes but it would require re-fetching the feature(s) after an
insert or an update, I think it will slow things down.

Besides that there is no perfect solution to server-side changes: if
some other user will trigger a data change on the DB we will of course
miss it anyway.

No.

This could be done asynchronously?
It sounds like a quite common scenario (or not if nobody complained...).

Thanks for the answer anyway.

I just upgraded from QGIS 3.10.8 to 3.10.11 and noticed that pywin32 is no
longer available. I develop a plugin for a client that uses win32clipboard
from pywin32 and would really rather not have the customer go through the

Any chance of getting it back, seeing how it is available in 3.10.8?

I can't comment on why that particular package is missing, but I'd
suggest you should be using the Qt clipboard classes here instead
anyway.

Yes -- there's two options:

1. (more hassle in the long run) Use cygwin and run the scripts
through that. Make sure that you have the "with_astyle" cmake option
enabled in your build too! Cygwin is easy to install, but it will be a
pain to find all the required dependancies for the prepare commit
script (e..g you'll need to get the perl packages)

2. (harder initially, less hassle in the long run) Install WSL and a
Ubuntu release through that. Run the prepare commit script inside the
Ubuntu shell. WSL takes a through hoops to install, but there's good
guides out there. After you have the Ubuntu shell available it's easy
to install all the required pacakges for the QGIS prepare commit
scripts.

Personally when I'm doing dev on windows I always use the WSL ubuntu
shell now, as it makes git/etc easier to use anyway!

Thank you for the response. I will look into the Qt clipboard.

I can't comment on why that particular package is missing, but I'd suggest you should be using the Qt clipboard classes here instead anyway.

Oh, there's also shitty option #3:

3. Push your branch to github and find out what you need to change
through the failing tests. Manually make these changes to files.
Repeat.

Don't do 3. It's painful for you, painful for all the other devs (who
have to wait while your string of commits are run through the ci
before other PRs will get a chance), and it's **incredibly**
environmentally insensitive. Think of all the wasted CPU cycles and
the carbon cost of this approach!

Push through the hurdles and you'll find 1 or 2 works, and then you'll
never have to deal with the frustration of a development process based
on the third approach ;)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Pluriform-memory-layer?
Message-ID: <2214cb1f-836a-f82d-58a2-090f90edf003@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Having 2 use cases currently:

- A geocoder responding with a pluriform set of (geometry/feature) results: points, lines, polygons (3 different sets of attributes). See: [0]

- A simple Line Of Sight analysis, resulting in a pluriform Geojson, holding: camera-viewpoint, fetched houses, selected centroids. See zipped attachment which you can paste into geojson.io [1] (or spread over 2 layers in QGIS) or see directly geojson.io if [2] works ...

- And do not forget the often requested 'generic drawing layer'.

I wondered...

Would it be feasible/usable to have a special kind of memory layer / drawing layer which does NOT have the single type of GIS Feature constraint?
So a layer which holds points, lines and polygons in one, with different (unique) types of attributes.
So maybe a geojson (or maybe a drawingjson?) which would end up in one pluriform layer, style-able with rulebased styles?

I do understand that this should not be a GIS-layer (as in not usable in analysis, showing attributes in a table etc)
But it would be very convenient if multi-type (geo)json could be easily loaded in one layer and styled there (or create a drawing tool in which you can scribble some lines etc)

Would this be worth a QEP or some discussion?
Or would this mess up our 'model/world'?
Seeing huge problems/issues?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Yes. Recent QGIS versions have taken some steps towards making this
possible. Specifically, the 2d vector renderer is now completely
capable of rendering a layer with mixed geometry types, which is
probably the biggest hurdle here. We don't yet expose a "mixed
geometry" renderer type, but that could be added relatively easily.

The remaining part would be making sure we catch layers with a
"geometry collection" wkb type everywhere that's appropriate, and
either:
1. gracefully adapt to the actual feature's geometry type
or
2. prevent the user from running the tool on the layer.

I'd say the biggest focus here should be in processing. If we started
by just adding a general flag to processing vector inputs to indicate
that they can handle mixed geometry types, and then filter them out as
an option for non-compatible algorithms then we could later work on
each algorithm in turn which should support geometry collections.

We'd also need to decide what to do about layer edits, but I'd say
initially we just keep things simple and block edits on mixed geometry
layers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Safely interact with loaded layers in Processing
	algorithms
Message-ID: <3c662755-5417-15e0-6ed4-6dcb0955fc0f@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I noticed that using in a Processing script something like:

project = context.project()

mylist = []

for layer in project.mapLayers().values():
     mylist.append(layer)
     # do whatever you like to do

might be NOT safe, or at least QGIS (3.10, 3.14) sometime crashes:

[Inferior 1 (process 24944) detached]
gdb returned 0
Aborted


Is this the correct way to do it or is there some more Processing 
oriented ways?

Cheers and thanks

Hi James,

pywin32 is still included.  But apparently it doesn't work anymore.

I think it's because it modifies the PATH with it's .pth file (via site.py).
And that change happens before QGIS import handler is installed.

QGIS doesn't use PATH directly anymore, but initally calls AddDllDirectory for
all directories in PATH and records the current setting of PATH when QGIS'
import handler is installed.  Any changes to PATH from imports are detected and
AddDllDirectory is called accordingly.

That's apparently the only way to avoid DLLs in system32 to mask DLLs in PATH.

Unfortunately the changes to PATH through .pth happen after QGIS has
AddDllDirectory the initial directories, but before the directories are
recorded.  So on import of win32clipboard it thinks that the directories in
PATH were already fed to AddDllDirectory, which they weren't, doesn't call it
and the load fails.

Fixed in OSGeo4W by moving the DLLs from pywin32_system32 to a directory
already in PATH.

Hi, I happened to go to:

https://api.qgis.org/

Which (according to DNS) is a CNAME for: qgis.github.io

But latest version there is 3.8

Anybody knows how and where to update that? Not that I think it is used as a landingpage by a lot of people, but IF we have it it should be uptodate....

Ah, I found 
https://github.com/qgis/api.qgis.org

Something broken there?

The actual api pages are working: https://qgis.org/api/3.16/ etc...

on api.qgis.org there is:
https://api.qgis.org/3.8/index.html which looks exactly like: https://qgis.org/api/3.8/
but the newer versions are not there

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all,
Thanks Peter. I got some time to give it another try. So I trashed my build
dir and restarted.
Now I'm stuck at

*In file included from ../src/3d/qgsskyboxsettings.h:*

*er.cpp.oninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.*

I don't know if it has anything to do but I had to fight against the "
Qt53DExtras" error to enable 3D













* CMake Error at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Qt5/Qt5Config.cmake:28
(find_package):   Could not find a package configuration file provided by
"Qt53DExtras" with   any of the following names:
 Qt53DExtrasConfig.cmake     qt53dextras-config.cmake   Add the
installation prefix of "Qt53DExtras" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
 "Qt53DExtras_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
 "Qt53DExtras" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
 has been installed. Call Stack (most recent call first):
 CMakeLists.txt:404 (FIND_PACKAGE)*

Recipes I found in the list and the install file didn't seem to fix the
cmake so I set  set the QT53DExtras_DIR to
/pathtoQGISrepo/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake*/Qt53DExtras* (in which I
found the missing file)

Thanks for any suggestion.

Hi Richard

I *think* this was me experimenting with publishing our docs on github
pages. We can either remove that CNAME and github pages entry iif it
isnt current, or if you are interested in adopting that workflow I can show
you what I was doing. I did a similar one for the web site too. My idea was
that we could offload the hosting overhead to GitHub, but it involves
putting the static generated content under version control which has some
gotchas. Maybe for now just point api.qgis.org to the qgis.org/api url?

Regards

Tim
