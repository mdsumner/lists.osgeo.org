Hi Marco,

Out of curiosity, since Hugo Mercier resigns from his seat as a voting
member, would that mean there is another new empty seat? And Saber can be
selected (since there is no other candidate)?

Thanks!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] pre-commit for code-formatting
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+Yjr_d4aT7OK+dRtXyzQQMGqfgOibHLtCiocPrSBeheKg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear devs,

A quick update on the recent work I pushed concerning the code-formatting.

Flake8 and black have been introduced for Python files and I am
progressively introducing clang-format for our cpp code.

All these tools are now configured individually as pre-commit instead of
globally called from prepare_commit.sh.

You can enable this by calling:
pre-commit install
(add -f if you had prepare_commit.sh set as a pre-commit hook before).

This work is still ongoing, and some files are still handled by
prepare_commit.sh. But it is defined as a local repo in the pre-commit
config. This means that you don't have to care about this :)

If you have any suggestions to improve the tools or formatting options,
this is all very welcome.

For more details:
pre-commit config:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml
clang-format config: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.clang-format

Best regards,
Denis

Hi Ismael,
This election is finished, and the elected voters could already take part
in the AGM.
Hugo's place will go into next year's election, and we will need to see if
there are places up for grabs; there might be no spots due to a country
user group that dissolves (a group contacted to ask how to do that).

Cheers
Marco

For the record, Hugo resigned on the 22nd while the ballot was open for
another 2 days until the 24th, though.
Shouldn't the ballot be closed as unnecessary on the 22nd and all nominees
be accepted?

Best
Stefanos

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] pre-commit for code-formatting
Message-ID: <CADBCwLaNpvigwEHEYLFxM=v2x55E2J_DHrrbMdsF4b2VHPvhcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Thank you Denis for all this work and the heads up for setting things up!

I have a few notes/questions about things I've encountered so far:

1. There are cases where the formatting is not applied. For example in PR
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/59382, after merging master and pushing,
clang-format fails in the CI

2. Is there a way one can manually run pre-commit for all modified files
and not just files staged for commit?

3. clang-format seems to try to squeeze parameters in a single line, even
if one has explicitly used new lines for readability.
For example, it will do this:

```cpp
-  else if ( isOnMesh && ( mWidgetActionDigitizing->zValueSourceType() ==
QgsMeshEditDigitizingAction::InMeshUseMeshZWidgetOtherwise ||
-                          mWidgetActionDigitizing->zValueSourceType() ==
QgsMeshEditDigitizingAction::InMeshUseMeshTerrainOtherwise ) )
+  else if ( isOnMesh && ( mWidgetActionDigitizing->zValueSourceType() ==
QgsMeshEditDigitizingAction::InMeshUseMeshZWidgetOtherwise ||
mWidgetActionDigitizing->zValueSourceType() ==
QgsMeshEditDigitizingAction::InMeshUseMeshTerrainOtherwise ) )
```
This is a big hit on readability when there are  parentheses in the
parameters.

4. It seems like with astyle we had something equivalent to
SpacesInAngles=Leave, so both static_cast<int> and static_cast< int > was
valid. Now the spaces are gone and while it's fine for small types, it is

Hi Stefanos,

Thanks for the feedback.

seems good now? Do you have a pointer to a failing workflow?
I fixed an invalid regex in prepare_commit 2 days ago, so hopefully
everything is ok now.

yes, either globally:
pre-commit run --all-files

or with a path
git ls-files -- src/core/geometry | xargs pre-commit run --files

I agree, I'll try to see if I can improve this.

you must choose with or without apparently in clang-format

same


As a side note, there's an online configurator where you can play a bit:
https://zed0.co.uk/clang-format-configurator/
You can load the QGIS config (you need to drop the ObjC part to make it
valid).

Cheers,
Denis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to force 'json(tree)' widget in feature info
 panel
Message-ID: <6d55d5cc-de3a-4b05-b108-4c2323a9d3b6@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Working with an api which returns json, we thought to make it possible to see the returned (small) json documents as a json tree widget (like you for example can see in a SensorThingsApi identify result, see screendump).

So creating a memory layer using and setting the providers attributes using a QgsField like:

QgsField(name="json",  type=QMetaType.QVariantMap, typeName='json', len=0, prec=0, comment="", subType=QMetaType.QString)])

(for which I stole type and subtype en typename from a layer which was showing the json widget...)

But in the featureinfo result the 'json'-field keeps being show as a plain string.

Am I missing some detail? Or magic?
Or is this something not possible with Memory Layers?

Any hint is appreciated.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

  
PS recently I was also asked by somebody if there was a plugin or widget which was able to show the result of an rest/json api call (upon clicking on a feature) in some kind of treeview (like Postman or even browsers) too...
I think some standard way of talking to simple api's from within QGIS would be a good thing to have..

Hello everyone,

Here's the report regarding the development and maintenance of the
QGIS-related websites for the last two weeks:

*QGIS.org:*

   - Add buttons to add release dates to the calendar
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/481> [Deployed]: Now we have
   the option to add a specific release date to the calendar or subscribe to
   the QGIS Release iCalendar
   - Redirect the news url to the feed detail
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/489> [Deployed]
   - Precise the current used hugo version in the README
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/488> [Deployed]
   - Remove nocache <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/496> [New PR]
   - Update hugo version to v0.139.0
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/487> [New PR]

*QGIS Plugins Website (QGIS-Django):*

   - Fix publish page formatting
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/493> [Deployed]
   - Prioritize the experimental flag in the metadata
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/494> [New PR]

*QGIS Feed:*

   - Feed item detail page <https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed/pull/96>

We are currently working on some system administration tasks by setting up
a standardized deployment environment using NixOs. We hope to migrate the
separated Plugins, Hub, and Planet to this standardized and reproducible
environment soon. Thanks to Ivan for his valuable input on this process.

Have a nice weekend,

Best regards,

Lova Andriarimalala

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New policies for QEP submission
Message-ID: <CAB28Asj28j1OtnOVwMLmKMy20+WogTsn950Usv93TMOyCqwoUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Given that there were no further comments for
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/308 within two
weeks, these changes have now been merged and the QEP submission policy has
officially been changed as a result.

Here's a summary of the new policies and what's changed:

   - *A QEP must be open for at least two weeks. This may be extended upon
   request (eg, "I'm on holidays but have feedback to give").*
   (was:
      - Must be open for at least *one* week
      - May be extended upon request (eg, I'm on holidays but have feedback
      to give)
      - May be extended if required
   -
*Newly submitted QEPs should be announced to the community via a message to
   the QGIS Developer Mailing List. The QGIS User Mailing List should also be
   messaged if the changes impact on QGIS end-users. *(new policy)
   - *Comments from the **whole** community are invited and valuable! You
   do not need any special permissions or status in order to give feedback. We
   welcome feedback from all parties, whether you're a developer, a
   documenter, a translator or an end-user.*
      - (was: "Others can assign themselves as interested e.g I might be
      interested in Processing but can't comment on the code. Mainly just to
      provide feedback.")
   - *For acceptance, a QEP requires at least 2 +1's from core QGIS
   developers or PSC members*
   (was:
      - Code based QEPs require at least 2 +1's from core developers.
      Including +1 from maintainer of that area of code
      - Project QEPs require majority PSC vote
      - If no maintainer for an area of code, requires at least 2 +1s from
      core developers
   - *If -1 votes are received from core QGIS developers, then the proposal
   should be amended or further discussion conducted to satisfy all interested
   parties. If consensus cannot be reached, the QEP can be raised to the PSC
   for voting.*
   (was:
      - If -1 votes are received (for code based QEPs) then the proposal
      should be amended or further discussion conducted to satisfy all
interested
      parties. If consensus cannot be reached, the QEP can be raised to the PSC
      for voting.
      - *The distinction here is the new clarification that the -1 votes
      only count if they are received from core QGIS developers -- previously
      there was no policy stating whether ANYONE could make a -1 vote
to block a
      proposal*

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Reworking QEP process to use pull requests instead
 of issues
Message-ID: <CAB28AshKZye_9247oxgKjt5bo08xNCRw6WKuA4ftQ1N4t0-ZtQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi lists,

As discussed recently in the "reworking the QEP approach" thread, I've just
submitted a change to the QEP repository proposing that we change
(back! ?) from issue based QEP management to pull-request based QEP
management.

Please see: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/310

This proposal also explicitly states that "policy style" QEPs (such as
those which describe coding conventions) are mutable, and that pull
requests can be sent in to propose changes to an existing QEP.

I'm hoping that after this reworked approach is accepted we can start
formally documenting a lot of the unspoken/implied policies we've got
surrounding QGIS development ?

(Let's keep discussion on
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/310 for future
reference!)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Merge attributes tool and default values
Message-ID: <CAES0Z6oUqNhgj+gc1g0i06kfbgRJGDHMbpJRC+Q92jaw5hST7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

I'm writing about a QGIS issue https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/59494.
In summary when using the merge feature tool the attributes for the pending
new feature are initially populated with a default value for the field if
one is set in the data provider (e.g. Postgres, OGR). The default value set
in QGIS doesn't have an effect.

Is this the intended behavior? At least in some cases it would make sense
if the value came from the selected features, like it does if a default
value is not set.

If it is the intended behavior and shouldn't be changed outright, would it
be okay to add an option for it in the Attribute form's "Policies" section,
similar to the splitting and duplicating policies?

Best regards,
Juho Ervasti

Hi Denis,

Thanks for this work, it works like a charm!

Could you add some instructions on how to use it and set it up correctly
in the developer guide ? 

I think it's a great tool on developer side but I have my concerns about
the CI part. It adds a lot of automatic commit which doesn't help when
you want to read the git history. If you want to blame a specific line
of code, you can land in this type of commit instead of the relevant
modification you were heading to. You can trace it back to the pull
request but it's one more step, and it makes us even more attached to the
GitHub platform.

Regards,
Julien

This is already published in
https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/developers_guide/git.html#procedure
Let me know if this needs to be improved.

Thanks to Nyall's hint, I have added the refactoring commits to
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.git-blame-ignore-revs
When I blame files online in Github it seems to be working:
For instance,
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blame/master/src/gui/actions/qgsactionmenu.h
Last commit is the pre-commit run but you don't see it in the blame.

But I have not done this job in the release-3_40 branch (in which I
manually backported).

More generally I am not super happy about clang-format being more painful
to play with our SIP macros but it's much easier than having to build a
dedicated tool. And having everything in a pre-commit config is much more
convenient and clearer/cleaner.

Best wishes,
Denis

I see only 2 options there:
1. We do not auto update PR (basically same behavior than before) and ask
people to setup the pre-commit hook
2. We automatically add the commits to the .git-blame-ignore-revs (possibly
after merge to avoid merging conflicts !!!) (might be an issue if it grows
too big)

Thoughts?

Hi,

First of all, Thank you Denis for working on this.

I guess that most of the regular contributors will activate the 
pre-commit hook at some point.
However, this probably won't happen for first-time or casual 
contributors and having a red CI because of some formatting error can be 
quite frustrating. So, I would favor option 2.

Based, on this discussion 
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76367362/what-are-the-performance-characteristics-of-git-blame-ignore-revs), 
it looks like that the size `.git-blame-ignore-revs` does not matter.

Jean

Not a great fan of this approach, It looks like complicated to me, I would prefer the old behavior.

Those automatic PR force also contributor to rebase before pushing new
modification to their branch. And if they have modified area of code
which have been reformatted, they get conflicts.

automatic pre-commit commits brings more difficulties than what it
solves IMHO.

I also tend to agree on that. On other projects I'm involved too (GDAL, 
PROJ, shapelib, libtiff) where we have put in place pre-commit, we just 
have a CI check that checks the formatting is OK. This requires a bit of 
education to first time contributors, but pointing to the documentation 
with clear instructions on how to setup pre-commit should be good 
enough. 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/edit/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md 
could also have some words about it

Like in 
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/edit/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md 
, " - [ ] Make sure code is correctly formatted (cf [pre-commit 
configuration](https://gdal.org/development/dev_practices.html#commit-hooks))"

On second thoughts, I agree with Julien and Even.

I would argue in favor of the auto update:

* it's easier for newcomers: having a pull request rejected because of
indentation is not welcoming
* it's easier for online editing
* the argument that you need to rebase is not valid to me:
    * you can always force push and the code beautifier will be run on top
again
    * the solution you mention is to have an environment properly set up:
if you do so, you won't have pre-commit commits in the log

I also don't like the commit bot.
I've already had to force push, which I don't like to as it usually
disturbs reviewing, because it committed a change even though pre-commit
was ran locally!

Clang-format was added to gui after the last commit of your head branch but
before you created the pull request. So this is due to the transition and
won't happen again.

Seems fixed indeed :)

Apparently, the online configurator you linked stops at version 10.
Starting with v13, clang format also allows SpacesInAngles=Leave
Could we use this or do we need to support older versions?

I believe setting those two to true would be more in line with the rest of
the style, which favors whitespaces, no?
Maybe I'll just have to get used to it :)

Any news on the multi line parameters improvement?

Thanks Denis for all your hard work and effort on this! It's
definitely a huge undertaking but extremely valuable for the project
and it will make QGIS development SO much nicer!

You have my heartfelt thanks!

This was always the intention, so go ahead! Note that there's already
an enum for this at Qgis::FieldDomainMergePolicy. You could follow the
same procedure as is used for Qgis::FieldDomainSplitPolicy to expose
this, auto-populate when reading OGR data sources, and then attach to
QgsField/QgsVectorLayer.

oops I had a mail in draft but did not follow-up

here is what I found:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39779985/how-to-control-clang-format-indentation-of-chained-method-calls
I've set a bounty but it didn't seem to attract attention :(
I don't see any solution for the moment now.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Merge attributes tool and default values

Hi Vedran,

Thank you for the suggestion, I didn't consider that, in this case it would
still be desirable to evaluate them elsewhere, just not in the merge
dialog. But I went ahead and tested it and even with that option checked it
still uses the default values, which seems like a bug.

Best regards,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3.46 builds to use Qt6?
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFcrbQq-jCMjTLef06+h=pjh7qEbGv6=uUWehitjZCRjzQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

As the time progresses and Qt6 support in QGIS is getting better and better
(huge thanks to all devs that have been pushing qt6 support forward!), what
do you think about setting a timeline to finally switch the official QGIS
builds to Qt6?

My understanding is that there are only few blockers left to address (e.g.
vectorized output from webengine, mac packages), so to kick off the
discussion, I would like to propose that QGIS 3.46 scheduled for October
2025 could be the first release where qt6 builds would be the official
ones. (qt5 builds could still be made, but not official anymore.)

I think that should hopefully give use enough time to get things ready, and
also give enough time for plugin developers to migrate plugins to be qt6
compatible.

To speed up work on the items left, we could even make next year's grants
specifically ONLY about qt6 migration, to make sure that we are on the
right track...

Does this sound doable, or am I just dreaming? :-)

Cheers
Martin

Hello everyone,

Below, you?ll find this week?s report on the development and maintenance of
QGIS? websites.

*QGIS.org:*

   - Update hugo version to v0.139.0
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/487> [Deployed]
   - Update hugo version for GH pages workflow
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/498> [Deployed]
   - Contact and Support page
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/472> [Merged]

*QGIS Feed:*

   - Fix for geofence feature <https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed/pull/99>
    [Merged]

*QGIS Planet:*

   - Add playwright e2e tests
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Planet-Website/pull/27> [Merged]
   - Set up a development environment with Nix flakes
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Planet-Website/pull/26> [Merged]: It
   includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically pushes the pre-built
   website to Cachix.

I also continued setting up the standardized deployment environment using
NixOs with the assistance of Tim and Ivan. Additionally, I?ve migrated a
portion of my local development environment to a NixOs-based one, and I?m
currently in the process of becoming familiar with it.

Best regards,

Lova Andriarimalala

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Escaping brackets in a tool tip
Message-ID: <CAED_52qUFmD1vP_hdeE-c_TFO00wL+mHgRJjsraoXYANOsCfkg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm updating a few tool tips and noticing that Scale and Rotate have tool
tips that start with Scale Feature(s) and Rotate Feature(s) but that the
brackets cause the s's to disappear in QGIS when they are displayed upon
hover.
Is it possible to escape out the brackets? Or is there something else going
on?
Thanks
-Bas
