Hi Richard

If I understand correctly, you could probably write a simple QGIS python
plugin to do this as well, without any javascript/webgl magic needed -
using gdalwarp to georeference the original maps and gdal's VRT to stitch
them together. Maybe just with the downside that it would not work "on the
fly", and the maps would need to be downloaded beforehand.

WebGL (or in our case its original desktop counterpart, OpenGL) usage in
those maps is to make the map rendering faster - this is something that
MapBox/MapLibre has been working on for quite some time. I would also like
to have the QGIS' 2D canvas rendered with OpenGL (or DirectX / Metal /
Vulkan) for faster map refreshes - but that's going to be a lot of work...
maybe QGIS 5.0 :-)

Cheers
Martin

Dear plugin developers,

some of you may have received unexpected pull requests from me on GitHub 
today (user: tobwen). This was unintentional, and I have already closed 
all of these PRs. I'm not a bot, I'm a geographer ;)

Some context:
As missing dependencies in plugins are a recurring issue, I've been 
reviewing plugins to identify and update their requirements.txt files 
accordingly.

My goal was to set up an alternative plugin repository for internal 
testing, which would include the updated requirements.txt files. If 
successful, I intended to offer these updates to you via pull requests.

Unfortunately, I forgot to comment out the pull request part in my code. 
As a result, the files were not only pushed to my own plugin repository 
but also sent to you via GitHub. This never was to run without manual 
curation and of course not without a bugreport.

I sincerely apologize for this mistake. My intention was not malicious; 
I simply wanted to help address the dependency gaps.

Best regards,
Tobias

Hi ppl,

I see that Allmaps has a Maplibre plugin: 
https://github.com/allmaps/allmaps/tree/main/packages/maplibre

So maybe using "MapLibre native Qt bindings": 
https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native-qt could be a way to bring 
it into QGIS.

cheers
Gerald

Hi Martin,

Thanks, but to be more clear:

- IIIF servers already serve out the maps in different resolutions in different number of 'tiles' per scale (like a tilecache without strict standardized tile definitions)
- the georef extension (creation and hosted by AllMaps) ARE georeferenced maps, as in: pixel -> lat lon coord and optionally the type of transformation

The WebGL path would just be the easiest, because than (I hoped) we could use their library to both fetch / choose scale AND warp the images...

But I will look into the way QGIS is doing this during georeferencing, maybe I can use the georeference info from the Allmaps-json to create the input for the gdalwarp and then create a VRT on the fly. Backside would be that I probably have to do this for the different z-levels.
But I will look into it.

Regards,

Richard

Hey everyone,

This week, I've been working on updating the branding for the plugins'
website and addressing some issues on the main website. Here's a summary of
what I've been up to:







*Plugins' website UI branding update: - You can check out a preview of the
updated plugins' website at https://staging.plugins.qgis.org
<https://staging.plugins.qgis.org> - I've opened a pull request related to
this update at https://github.com/Xpirix/QGIS-Plugins-Website/pull/5
<https://github.com/Xpirix/QGIS-Plugins-Website/pull/5> - Please take a
look and share your feedback or suggestions on the PR regarding the updated
UI for the Plugins website. *
*New PRs on the QGIS' main website:*

   - Improvement for development version roadmap
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/449>
   - Remove unused png inside static/img
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/450>
   - Update instructions for macOs installation
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/453>
   - Task to update news bar <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/454>


Have a nice weekend,
Best regards,

Lova Andriarimalala

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QEP 303: Implicit PR acceptance after 2 weeks with
 no review
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiXNG-wJiUXYWZdTBxvdCoHZhDOtRruBuY_6CWhWV2SkA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi lists,

Please see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/303
for a newly filed proposal regarding modification of the pull request
approval guidelines.

This proposal adds "implicit" approval for pull requests submitted by
developers with repo commit rights which have no review-related
comments within two weeks of their original submission.

Further detail is available at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/303 . As
usual, please submit feedback on the github page to keep discussions
centralised!

Thanks,
Nyall

Hello everyone,

I used to be able to edit label on issues and PRs, but it seems that I lost
the privilege sometime in the past year. Could I get I back?
Here's my GitHub account https://github.com/YoannQDQ

Thanks, and have a nice day.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Renaming a plugin directory?
Message-ID: <588147ef-91ae-4ccd-98ee-01210c5b34d4@wheregroup.com>

Hi there!

Wonderful people from Oslandia have started collaborating on our 
experimental (and somewhat buggy) Profile Manager plugin.

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/profile-manager/
https://github.com/WhereGroup/profile-manager/

One of the changes was restructuring the repository and using a 
PEP8-compliant directory name for the plugin's module directory 
("profile_manager" instead of "profile-manager").

Now the automated CI/CD upload of new releases fails. Presumably because 
the site expects "profile_manager".
https://github.com/WhereGroup/profile-manager/issues/10#issuecomment-2402479699

Would it be possible to update that on the plugin's existing Plugins 
repository entry?

I saw 
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2024-May/066744.html 
but that was only for the user visible name, the plugin's URL and the 
installed directory name stayed the same.

What would it mean for existing users?
Would they simply not be notified about new releases, and have to 
install the "new" plugin manually?
Or would something break and require manual intervention, e.g. two 
version of the plugin being installed and loaded, one in 
plugins/profile_manager and the old one in plugins/profile-manager?

Cheers, Hannes

Dear Hannes,

At the moment, it's not possible to change a plugin's directory name
(package_name) even through the administration page.

This feature was previously requested with a PR, but it was closed due to
potential client-side issues. When the package_name changes, QGIS may
recognize the plugin as a new one, leading to possible installation errors.
You can find the related PR and a more detailed discussion about it at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/271.

However, we are open to new ideas and suggestions on this matter. I can
also re-check the feature to have an updated detail about it.

Best regards,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] F5/refresh depending on panel with focus, possible?
Message-ID: <f93d492a-bea6-4a15-bbb8-c942cf5d4e07@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Doing a lot of (re)creation of small tables in postgis, I use the browser in QGIS to quickly load and inspect them.

I catch myself hitting F5 everytime almost automatically, because in a lot of tools (WebBrowsers, DBeaver, Nautilus etc), that refreshes your view.
Like in QGIS, but.. it refreshes the MapCanvas (only).

So I'm wondering: do the central widgets in canvas have something like 'focus', and if so would it, you think, be feasible to:
- refresh canvas if the focus is there
- refresh current active treenode in the browser if the focus (or last click?) is there.
(I am aware that refreshing the whole tree can be time consuming, hence only the active one)

OR is there a reason to not do this?
(or am I the only one having a need for such feature :-) )

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

All "native" algorithms are in the same folder "src/analysis/processing/" :
