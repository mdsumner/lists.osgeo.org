All the stable branches have had some maintenance work over the past year, and this release catches all branches up to the current state of development. Be prepared for the 3.9 branch to be EOL this fall alongside the release of 3.14.

Thanks Paul!

I tested them all with the Go bindings in

(pkgsrc has 3.13.0 so I don't pay attention to older branches.)

It looks like this has API breaks and is thus technically not a micro
release.  Or, is it that:

  - I'm confused (quite possible)?

  - the headers are part of the C++ API which is defined not to be
    stable, and not part of the C API, and therefore this is not an API
    break to the part of the API that is documented as usable?  (or
    something like that, that I am not understanding)

  - the headers should not be installed because they aren't actually a
    public API?

  - we believe that no depending programs use these and therefore there
    won't be trouble?

  - we don't expect changes on stable branches to be micro releases, and
    therefore they are not suitable for updates within packaging
    systems?

I wonder about Debian, in terms of being willing to apply this update.

Specifically, 4 include files in include/geos/operation/overlay are no
longer present.

1> Somewhat this, but not really. ABI stability has only been promised on the CAPI and as a result the vast majority of usage has been via CAPI. Anyone dropping a build package into a running system that is using the C++ ABI is sticking their fingers into the gears and might lose a digit.

Well, ideally we might try and figure out which are the ?public? C++ API and which aren?t but practically nobody has done that and inevitably as soon as you did that someone would show up complaining about the thing you took away that they absolutely require (not in this case though).

That?s the core of it.

At this point we are talking philosophy so I have nothing to offer. Your questions above hopefully clarify my nonchalance.

For a bit more context, the removed headers disappeared in this commit

https://github.com/libgeos/geos/commit/f92d697680a281f8cc26d5591b42ffa8efc7818b

and the added headers came from this one

https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/1239

Probably the removals were unnecessary, so ?future learnings? maybe don?t remove files in stable branches just on principle. But from a practical perspective, no body will be harmed by the change, so I remain sanguine.

Thanks for all the releases!

One weirdness: 3.9.6 is marked as "latest" on github.

https://github.com/libgeos/geos/releases/tag/3.9.6

I would think that honor would go to 3.13.1, yes? :)

Hrm, probably a artifact of the order in which I tagged things. I wonder if I can force another order...

For more context, I was cleaning up the remnants of the old overlay
engine.  It had already been substantially removed in
https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/788.  There were a few bits left,
which were used internally only by the buffer algorithm.  It seems pretty
unlikely that any external code uses just those pieces of the old overlay
engine.  In fact, the cleanup didn't delete the code, but just moved it
into the buffer package.

But I realize now that #788 was done before 3.13.0 was released, so it
appeared a "major" release.  My bad.

If it's a problem, it's easy to add the files back in.

If we think it's very unlikely any depending program would use the
withdraw headers, I don't see a need to fix.

Not sure what Paul means by "philosophy".   There are strong conventions
in packaging that

  Upstream releases either are API compatible with the previous (no
  interface changes = micro, additional but no withdrawn or changed APIs = minor)
  or have API breaks = major.

  Packaging systems within what is considered stable (varies, but e.g. a
  pkgsrc branch or a Debian numbered release) only update to micro or
  micro-or-minor, depending on the system.

  NEWS should highlight any API breaks or ABI breaks, so that people
  doing package updates get this right.

These properties more or less guarantee that (perhaps with rebuilding)
all other programs will continue to work with the updated version.

And thus, that in large part the point of micro releasse is that they
can be safely updated to, even in stable branches.  If that's not what
they are for, then I wonder where they should be used, and why we have
so many sort-of-stable release branches.  I would have thought that the
point of the older release branches was to be able to deliver security
fixes and bug fixes without API breaks.

I get it that in this case, the header withdrawal/move something that is
expected to result in 0 actual build failures, and that fixing them is
likely to be easy, so I've pushed the update.
