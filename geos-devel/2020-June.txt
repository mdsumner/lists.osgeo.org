Comment (by mdavis):

 Using the original geometries in full precision (see below for WKT), JTS
 reports both geometries as valid, and is able to compute the difference
 correctly.  The forthcoming OverlayNG should solve this issue in GEOS.

Subject: [geos-devel] millions of lines intersection against single polygon
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash9wdddL2m9JGRChvspkcSDsXy-h58E34FYS_yY_XceGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list!

I've a situation where I've got ~millions of lines (each consisting of
a single segment only) which I need to intersect against a complex
polygon.

Trying the naive way of multiple calls to GEOSIntersection_r gives
predictably horrendous performance. Is there a better way I can
approach this situation using the GEOS c api?

Thanks,
Nyall

That's an interesting problem.

Are the line segments in fully general position relative to the polygon?
I.e. they range from just touching it to fully crossing it, and may
intersect the boundary multiple times?

It would be faster to simply scan all the edges of the polygon and find the
ones which intersect the line segment. Then you would have to determine the
inside/outside relationship of the portions of the line segment to see
which ones to keep.  This could potentially be done with a Point-In-Polygon
check on the midpoint of each edge.  I'm not sure if the C API exposes an
indexed version of that.

The pending OverlayNG will improve things somewhat, since it can optimize
cases where the envelope of the line is significantly smaller than the
envelope of the polygon.

But there's room for further improvement.  Reusing the index of the polygon
edges would be improve performance.  And given the simplicity of the single
line segment, there might be a way to further reduce the number of edges of
the polygon in a general way.

There's an algorithm in PDAL that does this for point-in-polygon, but all
the guts are there to do segment intersections. You're welcome to take it
and modify to your liking:

https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/tree/master/filters/private/pnp

How much better it would from a more brute-force approach depends a lot on
the data.

They are actually "rays", possibly extending to infinity. But for the
simplicity I've restricted them to fall inside the polygon's bounding
box, since I only care about portion of the line within the polygon.
So they:
1. Will always intersect at least twice with the polygon exterior
2. May possibly coincide exactly with one or more exterior/interior segments

Thanks -- this is what I was suspecting, and somewhat fearful of! I
was hoping to avoid as much downstream logic as possible...

GEOSPreparedIntersects_r will handle that nicely!

Subject: [geos-devel] CMake in Geos 3.8.1 - Change runtime install directory
Message-ID: <CAFFyWHZLVZ4SHS8jPn1ehTDo2KFQW45SFR6QzLbMWm-o4_Zo_w@mail.gmail.com>

Good Afternoon,

My name is Mário and I'm a Terralib/TerraAmazon developer, and we use GEOS
in our opensource projects.

I have a question. I don't know if this mailing list is the best place to
ask, but If it is not someone can guide me and I can follow the right steps.

The question is related to CMake. We are building GEOS from source in
Windows 10 using VS 2017 64bits. Everything works perfectly with the
default build and installation, but we need to output the DLLs into the LIB
folder and not the BIN folder during the installation. Obviously I could
just copy the installed files to the folder LIB, but this would let the
files "lib/cmake/GEOS/geos-targets-debug.cmake" and
"lib/cmake/GEOS/geos-targets-release.cmake" pointing to DLLs files that
will not exist anymore in the BIN folder, invalidating the use of
"geos-config.cmake". This force us to create our custom "FindGEOS.cmake" to
locate GEOS in our custom paths.

Some libraries such as Proj4 and Curl allows us to define the custom the
folder to binaries using CMake tags such as: -DBINDIR:PATH=lib
or -DCMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR:PATH=lib

When analysing the CMake for GEOS,  in the line 71 of the CMakeLists.txt
seems to explicit define the runtimes output to the BIN folder:
set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin)

Is there any way to change the folder of the binaries? Maybe I'm doing
something wrong.

Thanks in advance for the time taken to read my issue.

Best regards to you all

Mário

> I've been thinking about this a bit more, and realized that lines being
coincident with polygon segments makes this a bit harder.  What's needed is
a simple "graph" structure along the line, which can determine which
portions of the line are inside, outside or coincident.  Then the overlay
result can be extracted from that.  There probably also needs to be a
little bit of snapping done, in case intersections lie very close together
(in which case they might reverse position along the line, causing
mislabelled topology).

Also, rather than a linear scan of the polygon edges a spatial index can be
used on the polygon (which can be reused).

All this suggests the possiblity of a new "OverlayPolygonLine" algorithm.
Even given the above, it will be quite a bit simpler than full overlay, and
should be a lot faster too.  I am planning to prototype this in JTS to see
how it works out.

What is the real-life use-case for this? Are the lines that you're
projecting related to one another in some way? Related to the polygon in
any way?

I probably should have started with that!

I'm trying to write an algorithm which calculates polygon fetch lines
(longest possible straight line inside a polygon). The general
approach is to create rays which connect each pair of vertices, clip
these to the polygon, and then find the longest one. It's horribly
inefficient for complex polygons, and I've only been able to find very
small optimisations to allow skipping the clip operation for some
pairs (e.g. calculate the length of the ray which is inside the
polygon's bounding box, if it's shorter than the current maximum
length candidate then discard the pair immediately, ditto with the
oriented minimum bounding box and convex hull).

1) This is not really the same problem as the one you posed.
2) There are definitely optimizations to be made.  You certainly don't need
to test every pair.
3) This may well be a solved problem. A literature. search is probably in
order. Sadly, line-of-sight comes up when people want to shoot things at
other people, though the problem may be a little different since the
shooter usually knows where the shootee is located.
4) Can the poly contain holes? If so, the problem seems harder.

Still scratching my head wondering why you'd want this number, but my
imagination is sometimes weak.

 We have a new bot berrie64 courtesy of Bruce Rindahl.

 This is an ARM chip Raspberry Pi 64-bit running Debian 10 buster.

 Going to check if this one runs into same issues as the 32-bit ARM
 raspberry pi we have.

Well, it boils down to the same issue -- clipping thousands/millions
of lines against a single polygon, in order to measure the length of
each inside the polygon.

Holes are actually the problem -- I've only found optimised approaches
for polygons without holes in my literature scan. And yes, the polygon
can contain holes.

It's inspired by this question:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/365901/finding-longest-straight-line-within-polygon-in-qgis
The routine is used for calculations like "what's the optimal
placement for a airplane runway" in this polygon.
