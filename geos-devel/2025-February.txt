Subject: Are GEOS maintenance release due?

Hi All,

Looking across the maintenance branches, I see a good number of fixes queued up:

- https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/3.13/NEWS.md
- https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/3.12/NEWS.md
- https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/3.11/NEWS.md
- https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/3.10/NEWS
- https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/3.9/NEWS

Seems to me it could be time to cut some maintenance releases.

Cheers, Mike

Yes, there?s some useful stuff in those changes.
Any objections to my running off a pile of patch releases?
