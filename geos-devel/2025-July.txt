It's coming up on time to do the annual release! We have the progress
meter in flight, and anything else that needs to complete before
release?

https://github.com/libgeos/geos/issues

If everything is looking OK, I will go ahead and tag a beta for
packaging and testing.

I'd like to finish #1268 and #803 at least. I thought we were
releasing in the fall?

Well, my goal as always is to hook up all the cars in the release train. To get widely packaged and deployed into clouds after the PgSQL 18 release, PostGIS needs to be in release when that happens, and to finalize PostGIS 3.6 for release, GEOS 3.14 needs to be in release.

So I?d like to get a beta out so we can get run through the packaging grinder in July, with a final release in early August.

That makes sense. I haven't been following Postgres development, so I
wasn't aware. In the future, is it fair to say that we should expect a
GEOS beta ~ 2 months after a Postgres beta? And a GEOS feature freeze
N weeks before the beta?

Yes, as a general rule at this time of year I'm going to be calling
for a beta so we can move into the packaging stage, with the goal of
having all the parts released by early September, and to have betas of
everything released even before that, so that everything ends up
packaged with the late-Sept/early-Oct PgSQL release date. At our
current development cadence, a yearly major release seems to serving
us well. I haven't given thought to a cadence for stable branch
releases, I wonder if we should put a calendar on that too.

I don't think it's worth it to put a calendar on stable releases, especially since most tools are using the C-API because those aren't going to impact packagers or anyone much.

e.g. if you have a 3.13.3  or 3.13.2  doesn't make a difference if your postgis was compiled against 3.13.1 per se, should still work with later without requirement of recompilation.

I would like to see more formality on End of Lifing releases such as

Once a release gets to be 5 years from first release, we EOL it.  That way we know what's expected for backporting.

So that would mean we should have EOL'd 3.9 2 2 quarters ago.

In general I find the degree to which old release branches are
maintained in the geos/postgis world to be surprising.   It seems to be
much more than for other projects.

If it were me -- which it's not -- I would be inclined to keep only the
current stable and previous stable maintained, unless LTS distribution
companies (e.g. RH, Ubuntu) wanted to donate to pay for maintenance.

Other than not documenting API withdrawals, this seems fine.




* API changes

I built this via pkgsrc, and here are the changes in installed files.

  - 3 withdrawn headers (not apparent in NEWS)
  - 6 new headers (inferrable as expected from NEWS)
  - minor version bump, but not major, in libgeos_c (ok)

ERROR:         /tmp/work/geography/geos/work/.destdir/usr/pkg/lib/libgeos_c.so.1.20.0

* odd linking issue

After building while 3.13.1 was installed, somehow pkgsrc decided that
the package needs to link against libgeos.so.3.13.1.  That's probably an
issue on our end, but I do not see this with other packages so there may
be something unusual going on.

* tests

After installing, I ran tests

  [snip]
  502/502 Test #502: xml-validate-TestRelatePP ..................................   Passed    0.00 sec

  100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 502

  Total Test time (real) =  13.94 sec

on NetBSD 10 amd64.

* postgis

With this, postgis's rc still builds.

Tests are no more troubled than with older geos.  (buggy postgis tests,
nothing real)

* qgis

With postgis built with this geos running, qgis loads features from a
postgis database.
