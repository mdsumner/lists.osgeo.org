No, it was not removed. I added it 3 months ago and I still can
see it in the trunk.

Mateusz,

Sorry I forgot to mention, I'm not testing trunk.  I'm testing the 3.1
branch and its not in there but the solution in 3.1 references it.  So
maybe you just need to upload it to 3.1 as well 

http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/browser/branches/3.1/tests/unit/capi

Thanks,
Regina

Regina,

I added the test to trunk only.
I don't submit to branches anything but bug fixes and only if target
version/branch is specified in ticket.

It looks like someone accidentally merged the Visual C++ solution update
with the branch 3.1. I don't know if I should submit it to the branch.

1. Prepare patch in single file

C:\my\geos\trynk> svn diff > fix-msvc.patch

2. Logon to http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/
3. Submit a ticket and attach the fix-msvc.patch file

That's the best and fastest way to help improving GEOS.

Sure thing Paul. I can't do it right now, but I'll provide you with a tested
patch before the end of the week. In the meantime, I have my changes for the

 FINITE(DoubleNotANumber) doesn't return 0 at IsValidOp::isValid.

 I had make patch for this problem.

 the fixed points are as follows.[[BR]]
 1) change DoubleNotANumber value from 1.7e-308 to
 numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN().[[BR]]
 1) change DoubleInfinity value from 1.7e+308 to
 numeric_limits<double>::infinity().[[BR]]
 2) add DoubleMax definition (use numeric_limits<double>::max()), because
 JTS Double.MAX_VALUE and Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY are same in GEOS (I
 think that this is a bug).[[BR]]
 3) add Coordinate::isNull for get equality of NaN value.[[BR]]

 I think that xnix environment have same problem (platform.h.in).

Patch committed to trunk (revno 2556).
Please give it a try, also for your IsValidOp failure

Message-ID: <20090606224000.GG96435@keybit.net>

As per http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/259 GEOS finally
uses proper NaN values rather than hand-crafted ones.

The downside of this is that we lost compatibility with
gcc 2.95.2 which didn't have the <limits> header in the 
companion stdlibc++.

The good aspect is closer track of JTS.

Tests with current trunk are highly welcome to early
catch introduced problems.

Subject: [geos-devel] installed C++ headers
Message-ID: <20090606224552.GH96435@keybit.net>

It was my idea long time ago to reduce the set
of installed C++ headers. Now I've changed my mind.

It's too much of a maintainance cost having to be selective
on what to install and what not, particularly when the MSVC
build scripts don't care and not only install headers but
even export symbols which were previously selected as NOT
public.

Also sometimes headers we'd like not to install are required
by others which we want in resulting in a partial hiding.

Nowadays, since we're explicitly marking the C++ ABI as
incompatible at every release, I wouldn't care about headers
that much. Users are warned they shouldn't be using the C++
api, after that if they do they'll deal with API changes
somehow.

I plan to update the Makefile.ams next week if nobody objects.

FYI: by installing *all* headers the include/geos
installed dir gets up to 1928Kb from 1128Kb for 335
header files from 172.

I still think it makes sense to do that, at least
for consistency (what win users get is what unix users get).

I have placed RC bundles on the download site:

http://download.osgeo.org/geos/geos-3.1.1rc1.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/geos/geos-3.0.4rc1.tar.gz

If I don't hear any bad reports or PSC vetoes in a couple days I will
copy those files into actual releases. Change are largely back-ports
of memory fixes from trunk and one nice little bugfix in buffer
building (dropped multipolygon components) from trunk.

I tried compiling geos-3.1.1rc1.tar.gz under MinGW and IT COMPILED.

though strangely can't get checkout from branch SVN to compile and also
can't compile the trunk tar ball.  I forget what error I get with that.

Haven't tried compiling 3.0.4rc1 yet.

forgot to do a make check and make check still fails (why should I be
surprised :().

But I think its the redundant includes except the geos_c.h ones not sure
about look kind of serious.

 Thought geos 3.1.1rc1 tests fail.  Comparing behavior of geos 3.1.1rc1
against geos 3.1.0 stable under PostGIS 1.4SVN under PostgreSQL 8.4 beta
2 with PostGIS torture test, they behave more or less the same.  Except
in 2 cases the buffer answers are different.  I assume that is to be
expected since a lot of work went into buffer.  I haven't checked to see
what these buffer differences are though.  But they are buffers dealing
with geometry collection and multilinestring.

Okay I visually inspected one of the buffer differences between 3.1.0
and 3.1.1 and it appears to be a bug fix.  In the 3.1.0 the buffer is
clearly wrong as it is missing one of the polygons that should have been
formed from the original goemetry.  In the 3.1.1 it includes the missing
polygon.

So its just seems to be the make check that is problematic as far as I
can tell.

#260: Problem using locale with WKTReader

 Hello,
 I spotted the following problem (on at least ubuntu and gentoo):

 When LANG=fr_FR.utf8 is set... WKTReader fails reading points.


 Giving "POINT (2154.7500000000000000 321.5380000000000109)" to WKTReader
 leads to the following error:
 Unable to handle the packet: ParseException: Expected number but
 encountered word: '2154.7500000000000000'.


 I checked in the source code... and WKTReader uses the strtod(...)
 function in io/StringTokenizer.cpp:76 which uses the locale to decide what
 looks like a number... or in French, we use "," instead of "." for the
 radix character.

 This is kind of a problem for an application which cannot "force" the
 locale to be the standard C one...

geos-3.1.1rc1 -- fails under Visual Studio 2008.  well at least for me anyway.


1) capi unit is still referencing GEOSGeomToWKB...  -  I think Mateuz said this should not be in 3.1.1 -- just in 3.2? I took it out, but everything still fails
2)badthreadtest.c, threattest.c, geostest.c -- have a big red mark -- saying they are missing CoordinateSequenceFactor.cpp among other things.

Paul,
Haven't tried 3.0.3 but the 3.1.0 tar ball fails too with similar errors.  I usually compile from SVN rather than the tar and I recall that passing but it was about 2 weeks ago i tried that.  Let me try compiling directly from SVN to make sure that works.  If so could be just the tar balls that are missing something.

Weird.  I can build geos-3.1 branch from SVN but not from the tar ball.  Though I skip over some things since I don't have ruby and so forth.  But I tried to repeat my steps a couple of times and seem to always be able to build from SVN -- after taking out the WKBTest thingy.

Paul,
Haven't tried 3.0.3 but the 3.1.0 tar ball fails too with similar errors.  I usually compile from SVN rather than the tar and I recall that passing but it was about 2 weeks ago i tried that.  Let me try compiling directly from SVN to make sure that works.  If so could be just the tar balls that are missing something.

Okay I think this may be something really stupid -- I was able to successfully compile the geos 3.1.0 tar by resetting all the files to not read only.  Weird because none I looked at looked like they were read only in properties.  So could be maybe just a file the vs is trying to create is being added to the tar.

I'm trying to recompile the geos 3.1.1rc1 tar now.

geos-3.0.4rc1  -- no good.  completely missing the build folder.  So is the geos-3.0.3 so maybe no vs person ever compiles from the tars.  It looks like we had vc80 for 3.0.. in SVN at any rate.

Comment:

 Hello,

 I believe the problem isn't totally fixed yet. I'm using geos 3.1, here is
 a minimal test case that englithens the bug :

 {{{
 #include <locale.h>
 #include <iostream>

 #include <geos/geom/Point.h>
 #include <geos/io/WKTReader.h>
 #include <geos/io/WKTWriter.h>

 int main(int argc, char* argv[])
 {
   setlocale(LC_ALL, argv[2]);
   geos::io::WKTReader r;
   geos::geom::Point* p = (geos::geom::Point*) r.read(argv[1]);

   geos::io::WKTWriter w;
   std::cout << w.write(p) << std::endl;
 }
 }}}

 {{{
 yabo@xen ~/dev/geos_test_1 $ ./a.out  'POINT(42.42 0)' 'C'
 POINT (42.4200000000000017 0.0000000000000000)
 yabo@xen ~/dev/geos_test_1 $ ./a.out  'POINT(42.42 0)' 'en_EN.UTF8'
 POINT (42.4200000000000017 0.0000000000000000)
 yabo@xen ~/dev/geos_test_1 $ ./a.out  'POINT(42.42 0)' 'fr_FR.UTF8'
 terminate called after throwing an instance of 'geos::io::ParseException'
   what():  ParseException: Expected number but encountered word: '42.42'
 Aborted
 yabo@xen ~/dev/geos_test_1 $
 }}}

 I'm using Gentoo linux on a 64bit platform with geos 3.1.

 {{{
 yabo@xen ~/dev/geos_test_1 $ uname -ap
 Linux xen 2.6.28-gentoo-r5 #8 SMP PREEMPT Mon May 18 11:55:05 CEST 2009
 x86_64 AMD Phenom(tm) II X4 810 Processor AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux
 yabo@xen ~/dev/geos_test_1 $ emerge -pv geos

 These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

 Calculating dependencies... done!
 [ebuild   R   ] sci-libs/geos-3.1.0  USE="python -doc -ruby" 0 kB

 Total: 1 package (1 reinstall), Size of downloads: 0 kB
 yabo@xen ~/dev/geos_test_1 $
 }}}

 After inspecting the code, the point of failure is, as said in the first
 report, in io/StringTokenizer.cpp:76 where the strtod function is used,
 which is a locale-dependant function.

We have similar issues with compiling under nmake.

I can successfully compile with nmake VC 2005 the svn branches/3.1

but the tar ball is a no go
its missing nmake.opt

among other things -- 

This is just my own ineptness, but not sure how to do a make check on an
nmake built one.

If I use the nmaked dlls in PostGIS -- it hmm reads the wrong version
number --
still registers as GEOS="3.1.0-CAPI-1.5.0" (or has branch svn not been
updated?) 

Though the one compiled with MingW correctly reads (this one was
compiled from the tar ball)
3.1.1-CAPI-1.6.0

And according to a private mail this is a pre-existing issue, not one
introduced in the point release.

Message-ID: <20090619104735.9eza4zchs000ck0k@webmail.makina-corpus.com>

Hi all,
I created a ticket and a patch to expose GEOS Hausdorff distances in C-API.

http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/264

Please review the patch and be indulgent as it's my first attempt in  
modifying GEOS. Let me know of anything particular or change required  
on this patch.
I'll then start working on creating the interface in PostGIS.

Vincent

 Hello,

 I have downloaded and built geos-3.1.1 according to instructions and
 everything works perfectly. However it seems like I can only use member
 functions from geos::geom, geos::io, and geos::util classes. When I tried
 to use call functions from the geos::algorithm::CGAlgorithms, the compiler
 gives "'algorithm': the symbol to the left of a '::' must be a type"
 error.

 Sorry I'm still new to GEOS, any help would be greatly appreciated,
 thanks.

Access restriction was by design, due to high instability of the C++
API/ABI. You're highly reccommended to use the C-API instead.
That said, in current GEOS trunk (upcoming 3.2 release) all headers
are installed so that users are free to hurt themselves.

Message-ID: <23ab5f0a0906260833n112e83dco4645e2a55f4ca592@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,First of all, I apologize if this post is unrelated to the scope of the
mailing list (I hope not).
I have to find an algorithm to draw the maximum enclosed circle in a
polygon, which is slightly different from the "well-known" geometry problem:
"maximum empty circle"; in this case, not only all the vertices need to be
outside the circle but also the entire perimeter of the polygon must *not*
be inside the circle.
I can get the center of the polygon using Voronoi Diagrams: anybody has any
suggestions or recomendations of how to calculate its radius?
Also, I would like to avoid as much as possible iterative processes (as they
can be slow when dealing with a high number of polygons, that have
complex frontiers)...
It would be really appreciated any ideas on this, or even references to
libraries that could help me... Im not finding a lot of stuff about this on
the web :-/ Im using C/C++ but all ideas are welcome, really...

Thanks in advance for your time!
                                        cheers,
                                               Jo

Hi,
Does anybody know a good website with clear examples and definitions of
spatial relationships, such as Touching, Crossing, etc?
(apart from the OGC spec, that didnt help me that much..)
          Thanks in advance for ur help,
                                                    Jo

Hi Jo,

You mean you want to know about "Incircle of an irregular polygon"?

I don't know that GEOS(or JTS) had already implement it,
but if not, you might google the word above. (and I hope GEOS(or JTS)
implement it)

The following site is written in Japanese, but the images may be helpful.

Sanak.

Hi Allegri,

I encountered the same problem today.
(I am using gcc-3.4.5, referring to
http://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/UsersWikiWinCompile)

The cause seems to be the latest MinGW bug, and Mark has already report
MinGW tracker.

[Latest MingW download breaks g++ -ansi option - ID: 2373234]
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2373234&group_id=2435&atid=102435


I had modified "cwchar" file referring to the following site,
and I could "make" geos-3.0.4 successfully with the latest MinGW.

ESRI have pretty good documentation on this topic:

I thought I would published my solution here, for all the ppl who are lazy
like me, and google for a solution before posting...
Dis problem is reduced to finding the InCirce of a polygon, which is
slightly different from the well-known geometry problem: largest empty
circle.

http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Compgeometry/MyCG/CG-Applets/LgEmptyCircle/lccli.htm

In the "largest empty circle" we calculate the Voronoi Diagrams and test
each of its vertexes inside the convex-hull as a candidate for the center.
It all comes down
to a max-min optimization of the radius: the largest radius, that does not
contain any points inside (and therefore, the circle is "empty").
The Largest inscribed circle, is very similar except that here we look for a
circle that does not contain the *actual* polygon (rather than just its
vertexes).
The distance we wont to test here is the (minimum) distance of the candidate
centre to the polygon.
I struggled a little bit here to measure a distance from polygon to a point
that is located inside it, and ended up having to decompose the polygon to
its boundary
to get it done (Im using OGR)!
Here is the result:

http://ladybug.no-ip.org/files/inCircle.png

Just as a final note: there are plenty (exact) implementations of the
incircle (or apotheom) of a triangle or a regular polygon, but it becomes a
bit complicated when we are dealing
with irregular geometries, which is my case... (and prob everyone else
workin in GIS)

ESRI have pretty good documentation on this topic:
http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisserver/9.3/DotNet/index.htm#geodatabases/spatial_relationships.htm

Thanks! That helped :-)

Jo,

The JTS (GEOS' father) has a very good test suite with
visual presentation of validated cases:

Hi Jo,

Hmm.. I think that Voronoi Diagrams approach is usefull for computing
"circumscribed circle" but not "inscribed circle", if the geometry is
triangle.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribed_circle

But your result image seems to be well computed and have no problem.

Thanks for your reply.

Regards,

Sanak.

I realize others have already answered, but thought I'd throw in a couple of
links to resources we've got which may be useful for GEOSers --
http://www.fmepedia.com/index.php/SpatialRelator_For_Dummies is the start of
a page we're working on to try to make the relationships more concrete, and
the table in this help file may also be useful:
http://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FFT/fact_spatialfilter.htm


Hope this helps.

You are totally right, and I can see in some cases, the algorithm is unable
to find the right candidate to centre, searching only among the Voronoi
vertices.
Anybody has any suggestions for choosing the candidates of centres for the
maximum "circumscribed circle"? It does not need to  touch all vertices, but
it needs to be the largest circle
that fits inside the polygon.
And btw, is an irregular complex polygon...

 cheers,

       Jo

Hi Jo,

Hmm.. I think that Voronoi Diagrams approach is usefull for computing
"circumscribed circle" but not "inscribed circle", if the geometry is
triangle.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribed_circle

But your result image seems to be well computed and have no problem.

Thanks for your reply.

Regards,

Sanak.

How about creating a grid of centre candidates and refining search near the
best match (in a sort of quadtree approach)?Does anybody have any experience
wid that? Would it be awfully slow?

Hi Jo,

I think Angle bisector approach is the simplest way for computing incenter
of an irregular complex polygon. (but may be non-robust.)
The following steps is only my assumption.

1. compute orientation of polygon to know which side is inside.
 - GEOS/JTS "algorithm.CGAlgorithms.isCCW" method is useful.

2. compute angle bisector of every continuous three points in polygon as
ray.
 - JTS "geom.Triangle.angleBisector" method may be useful.

3. get intersection points of angle bisectors.
 - Sorry, I couldn't find the method that compute intersection
points(noding) of rays(not line segments) in GEOS/JTS, but I think this
algorithm is not so difficult.

4. exclude points that are outer of polygon.
 - GEOS/JTS relate operation (like within/covers ..) is useful.

5. compute distance from every candidates of centres to polygon, and choose
largest one.
 - GEOS/JTS distance operation is useful.

Regards,

Sanak.

When you install MSVC 2005 or 2008, there should be some shortcuts in
your start menu: use the "Visual Studio 2005/2008 Command Prompt" one.
Then you can cd into the /geos directory and execute the commands:

  autogen.bat
  nmake /f makefile.vc MSVC_VER=1500     (for msvc 2008)
