All,

PDAL 2.8.1 has been released. It is a bugfix release of the 2.8-maintenance branch.

Subject: [pdal] pcl and boost?
Message-ID: <rmiwmhv21c7.fsf@s1.lexort.com>

I saw the announcement of pdal 2.8.1, and was going to update it in
pkgsrc, but pcl is broken.  The latest pcl is 1.14.1 and it fails to
build with boost 1.86.0.

It doesn't seem like pcl has a mailinglist.  There's a pinned bug whose
title suggests discord and whose body suggests stack overflow :-(
I did file a bug:

  https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/issues/6157

As pcl seems to be a key dependency of pdal, I wonder if anyone else
here is having problems with boost 1.86.0.  (Or really, if anyone can
build it *with*.)

A very long time ago, PCL was an optional dependency of PDAL, but that is no longer the case. Any of the significant algorithms that PDAL was using from PCL have been ported by Brad Chambers to PDAL filters.

Thanks for point that out.  I am guessing that the pkgsrc package just
never dropped it as an expressed dependency.  Indeed our
/usr/pkg/lib/libpdal*.so do not link against, it, and on removing pcl
everything still builds.
