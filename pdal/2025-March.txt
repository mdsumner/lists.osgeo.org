Subject: [pdal] Build/install pdal on raspberry pi zero 2
Message-ID: <CAPyvaVZRwK4ACZo7ee58vCqwMC53iHZbSVoH9ngXuOttqUomEw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone! :)

I tried to install pdal with conda/mamba to my pi zero 2 always getting a
message that pdal is not found...

With building i got issues too, with 500mb memory and 2GB swap  wasn't
enough to build...

Since i only want to transform pcd files to laz i thought getting only the
cpp and headers from source i need and using them directly in my code. Or
should i try laszip?
Im new to c++ i'm a c# developer

What do you suggest, how should i proceed?
Any idea is welcome :)

Best regards,
Istv?n
