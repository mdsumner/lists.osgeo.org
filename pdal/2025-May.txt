Hello Andrew,

If I don't set the origin, I get multiple PointViews as expected. My 
question was about setting the origin outside the bounding box of my 
points. In that case I only get one PointView. Am I wrong to expect the 
points to be splitted in multiple PointViews of size 5000m starting at 
the origin I set?

Regards,

Hi Aur?lien,

If you can reproduce a problem, I'd suggest opening an issue with details.

The following worked fine for me. You can run this for yourself if you
clone the `pdaldata` git repository:

[
    {
        "filename": "pdaldata/workshop/autzen.laz"
    },
    {
        "type":"filters.splitter",
        "origin_x": 636000,
        "origin_y":850000,
        "length":1000
    },
    {
        "type": "writers.las",
        "filename": "TestAutzen#.laz"
    }
]

This appeared to create 25 point views as I got 25 files of output.
