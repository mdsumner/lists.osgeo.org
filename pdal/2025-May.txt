Hello Andrew,

If I don't set the origin, I get multiple PointViews as expected. My 
question was about setting the origin outside the bounding box of my 
points. In that case I only get one PointView. Am I wrong to expect the 
points to be splitted in multiple PointViews of size 5000m starting at 
the origin I set?

Hi Aur?lien,

If you can reproduce a problem, I'd suggest opening an issue with details.

The following worked fine for me. You can run this for yourself if you
clone the `pdaldata` git repository:

[
    {
        "filename": "pdaldata/workshop/autzen.laz"
    },
    {
        "type":"filters.splitter",
        "origin_x": 636000,
        "origin_y":850000,
        "length":1000
    },
    {
        "type": "writers.las",
        "filename": "TestAutzen#.laz"
    }
]

This appeared to create 25 point views as I got 25 files of output.

Subject: [pdal] PDAL code for LasTools and WhiteBoxTools functions?

Dear PDAL Community:
(first time post)
Success Story?Here's the problem I was working on:?



.laz files downloaded directly from the NOAA site were opening as thin lines instead of the expected 3D point cloud in CloudCompare. With the help of another forum, I figured out it was because the coordinate system in the NOAA files is spherical and CC is looking for cartesian coordinates. PDAL in a single command line helped me convert to an appropriate cartesian CRS, and this solved the problem. Details of the exchange in the CC forum?HERE.


Very exciting.

New Problem and Questions for the PDAL CommunityInspired to do more with PDAL, my question to this community is whether PDAL can be used to perform point-cloud processing functions from LasTools and WhiteBoxTools that have frustrating inconsistencies when used from QGIS, at least on my computing platform (Mac OS). Inconsistencies are multiplied for me because I use LiDAR files (.laz and .las) from multiple sources.?
The functions I'm using in my forest carbon research are:

lasheight (from Lastools)HeightAboveGround (from WhiteBox)LidarDigitalSurfaceModel (from WhiteBox)

Are these functions already duplicated in PDAL? Or is there command lines that effectively do the same thing?

Any experience and advice on this subject will be greatly appreciated.
Sincerely,
Ken

Hi Ken,

See filters.hag_dem, filters.hag_delaunay and filters.hag_nn. I don't know
how close they are to the tools you mention. You can use writers.gdal or
filters.faceraster with writers.gdal to create a raster.

I'm a newbie to PDAL...
My environment:MacOS Sequoia 15.41Running Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook
Question:I've been successful getting PDAL up and running through the Terminal App.
But now I'd like to run PDAL commands if possible from a Jupyter notebook.

Running the following command from Jupyter produces the expected output:
conda create --yes --name PDALenv --channel conda-forge python-pdal

However, when I follow this with the command to activate the area I created with this command:
conda activate PDALenv

I get following error from Jupyter:
CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate'

I can run the suggested command of 'conda init' and get expected output.

But if I re-try to run 'conda activate PDALenv' I get the same error.
Any thoughts about how I might work through this?
Sincerely,
Ken

Rereading your original post, am I correct in understanding that you have
Jupyter installed (perhaps even independent of Conda) and you are trying to
run the Conda commands to create and activate the environment within the
already running Jupyter notebook? I'm not sure that the Conda environment
is ever going to activate, at least not without jumping through some hoops
to make it happen.

The approach that I regularly use, which should work for you, is to create
your PDAL environment from the command line prior to starting Jupyter. Make
sure to install both PDAL and Jupyter to the environment, then activate it.
At this point you should be able to start Jupyter and import PDAL.
Something like this:

conda create --yes -n PDALenv -c conda-forge python-pdal jupyter
conda activate PDALenv
jupyter notebook

 Hi Bradley,
Thank you for this advice. I'm traveling for the next few days but will try this when I get back to the office and have a chunk of time to focus on this.
I'll let you and the community know how it works out.

I get following error from Jupyter:
CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate'

I can run the suggested command of 'conda init' and get expected output.

But if I re-try to run 'conda activate PDALenv' I get the same error.
Any thoughts about how I might work through this?
Sincerely,
Ken
