Subject: [pdal] Reference for pdal in python
Message-ID: <CAPryQ-MQFz_LZGNrAeZnDLQ5D2QbemhgorqF9Vvkz7siXbKU1Q@mail.gmail.com>

The only reference I have seen to using pdal in python is the README on the
github page. Is there a more complete reference?

Searching for 'Python' on the website should yield a number of examples, but there is no 'complete reference' to the PDAL Python bindings. The tests should be inspirational, however.
