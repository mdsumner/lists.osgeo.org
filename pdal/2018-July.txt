Hello folks,

We have setup a pipeline with text reader, chipper and gdal writer. The text file contains XYZ data and roughly 5 million points. Running the pipeline produces a number of files where the files size and coverage area is increasing. The first tiff file is 71 kb, the second is 217 kb, the 20th is 1,8 MB, the 100th is 6,7 MB, the 600th is 47 MB etc.

We expected this pipeline to produce similar size tiff files. We have tried using a different reader but get the same output. From our point of view is appears to be an issue with the GDAL writer.

Taking a look at the source code it appears the GDALWriter::readyFile method uses the "bounds" parameter validity to decide whether to create a new grid or not. I am not sure a not specified "bounds" parameter is valid. This is just an observation.

The pipeline is attached.

Using PDAL 1.7.1 on Windows 10

Subject: [pdal] Pgpointcloud writer SRID
Message-ID: <HE1PR03MB1338EF719ABE65D1CBC22392CA470@HE1PR03MB1338.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,

We used a pipeline (see attched file) to read a laz file and write it to pgpointcloud. The pipeline was able to write data to database but we notice the SRID was incorrect. Turns out the laz was using UTM Zone and pgpointcloud used 4326 (the default). By adding a reprojection filter to the pipeline we were able to fix the issue.

We mistakenly thought that pgpointcloud would "reproject" the input data to srid 4326 but it makes sense the this task belongs in a filter.

It is unfortunte that PDAL allowed us to create what I consider is invalid data which could have been prevented. The "srid" parameter used in the pipeline appears to be a string with sole purpose of being added to the pointcloud_formats table. In pgpointcloud witer, would it be possible to use input-srid (in_srs) as default if available instead of always using 4326? Another option could be to give the user a warning if input-srs does not match the "srid" specified for pgpointcloud writer.

It might be worth adding more information about pgpointcloud writer "srid" to the documentation to help others.

Kind regards, Lars

Hi Connor (or Howard),

We found, that in the EPT format you switched from a list of oct-tree
numbers to to a depth-x-y-z format:
https://github.com/connormanning/ept#hierarchy

I would be interested to know about the reason for this change (advantages
of the new hierarchy/disadvantages of the previous one). I'm not against
the change, just curious to learn about the reasons.

Best regards,
Daniel

This choice was made because to access the new static EPT format, you must
use DXYZ keying to read the data files.  Therefore it seemed fitting to
match the hierarchy notation to the data storage notation.  Also, with the
new data keying format being a slippy-map tiling, it seemed sensible to
avoid mixing it with the old octree-node relative addressing.

Comments/criticisms on the format in general are welcome - and feel free to
submit issues on that `ept` repository in that regard.

Cheers,
Connor

PDAL refuses the temptation to guess. It is very difficult to detect
that two coordinate systems are "different", and automatically infer
your intention, even in this scenario.

Deconstructing a coordinate system defined by WKT or GeoTIFF keys to a
single authoritative EPSG code is a task that is rarely successful in an
automated fashion. We are unable to take the SRS and assign a single
value for the "srid" to the output data. Again, we refuse the temptation
to guess, and that is why there's a parameter on the writer for users to
assign what they need.  Maybe some more docs related to the topic would
help, but this is a challenge for all of PDAL's writers, not just
pgpointcloud.

> It might be worth adding more information about pgpointcloud writer "srid" to the documentation to help others.

We would be happy to merge a patch that added such experience and
documentation. Please file a ticket with language you think would be
most helpful.
