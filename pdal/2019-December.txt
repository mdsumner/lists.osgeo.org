Subject: [pdal] How to help tindex to find a driver?
Message-ID: <4cad0d78254a2162554cdd8d0f85c7ab@webmail.suomicom.fi>

Hi,


I can read info from my xyz files by defining two extra options for the 
reader and header
pdal info --driver readers.text  --readers.text.header="x y z" 
point_data.xyz --boundary

How can I make tindex to use those two options? So far all my trials 
have been unsuccessful leading to error
PDAL: Cannot determine reader for input file: first_file.xyz

Here is an example about what I have tried:

pdal tindex create --tindex boundary.sqlite --driver readers.text 
--readers.text.header="x y z" --filespec *.xyz -f sqlite

I don't see any reason why this wouldn't work.  If you could open an issue
on Github that would be great.

Subject: [pdal] What's wrong with pdal density?
Message-ID: <08241373d762b007b50ba95a14962214@webmail.suomicom.fi>

Hi,

I have tried to repeat the example from 
https://pdal.io/workshop/exercises/analysis/density/density.html#density. 
I have prepared test data that opens with pdal info simply as "pdal info 
  testdata.txt". If I run now

pdal density testdata.txt -o output.sqlite -f sqlite --debug on
(PDAL Debug) Debugging...

just nothing seems to happen. Output file is not created but I don't get 
either error messages or more debug info. Pdal info --boundary works as 
expected.

PDAL version is pdal 1.8.0 (git-version: Release) from OSGeo4W.

Jukka,

PDAL 1.8.0 is quite old. Can you grab a conda build and test there? I seem to remember a bug fix from a while ago on this topic.

Jukka, for a text file, you probably need a header to map the dimensions. Does it work with pdal info?

Hi,

Thank you for encouraging me to try conda for the first time ever. Nice 
experience. Also good news, with version pdal 2.0.1 (git-version: 
Release) the density command worked fine.

You seem to be the maintainer of these packages 
http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/x86_64/release/pdal/, I wonder if I 
dare to give a hint...

Regards,

-Jukka Rahkonen-

Good to hear. QGIS is available on Conda Forge too, if that's what had you using OSGeo4W...

>

The PDAL team no longer maintains any OSGeo4W packages. We found it too difficult to keep the dependencies controlled. Conda Forge-based builds are not so much better in that regard, but there is a much larger framework of libraries and developers using it. Conda binaries also give us distribution with all three primary platforms, and the conda platform is integrated into development environments quite cleanly (Visual Studio Code being a primary target for us).

I have not removed the OSGeo4W builds because I did not know what OSGeo4W software might have been using them.

I believe that GRASS may be using them, but that may be problematic with
the transition to proj 6 and gdal 3.

Subject: [pdal] looping multiple bounding coordinates in PDAL Pipeline
Message-ID: <CAGHb011VeJ21_uyRU5aXrpZ0fwMs0sS13X6BD6eJtYqkb3NPJw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for some advice on the best way/how to loop in thousands of
bounding coordinates into a pdal pipeline.

I have a csv (and a geojson) of several thousand min/max x/y and a unique
ID. The AOI's are not very big, so the pipeline runs quickly, but there are
a lot of AOIs to capture! I'm querying an entwine dataset, the extent of
which is national, so I'm limiting the data with a bounding box of each AOI.

My pipeline currently runs HAG and Ferry Z filter, then uses the
gdal.writer to make a GeoTiff at 1m resolution. It works perfectly when I
manually enter in a set of test coordinates. How can I scale this to loop
and update the bounds automatically?

I'm running this locally on a MacBook Pro.

Thank you, any advice is appreciated!

Hi,
I imagine you are working with Python? Sharing your script could help. I see multiple options but it’s hard to grasp what you need and how fare you are.

Hi Nicolas,

Thanks for your reply!

I'm attaching my pipeline here. So far I have been running the pipeline
through command line in a conda environment. I'm fairly comfortable with
python and have set up pdal to work with my python environment, but haven't
tried anything outside of the command line yet. I also have a csv with the
following columns [minx, maxx, miny, maxy, id].

Ok, 

Running the command in a python script will be the next step in my opinion. This will permit the looping process.   Do you need to multithread the task to make it faster?  I will try to  look at this tomorrow.  I have some examples I can give you that will help.  

I am not a pdal guru but if you figured out the command, the rest is probably easy in Python.  Others, please help out if you have better ideas.

Examples would be extremely helpful! Multithreading would be ideal, but not essential.

Jason,

PDAL doesn't multithread or operate in a parallel fashion for you. You must use external tools to do this yourself. I have had good success using GNU parallel or xargs on bash along with the Python multiprocessing library to achieve that.

You scenario would seem to fit that model quite well. Here's a GNU parallel example. In short, use your favorite scripting language (or sed/awk/cat) to write a script that contains all of the job entries you need to run (bounds entries are all the same in my example, but you should get the point:

> pdal pipeline pipe.json --readers.ept.filename="ept://http://path/to/location" --readers.ept.bounds="([-10063436.56, -10060190.36], [5038996.16, 5043062.79])" --writers.gdal.filename="hag_mean_henry_co.tif"
> pdal pipeline pipe.json --readers.ept.filename="ept://http://path/to/location" --readers.ept.bounds="([-10063436.56, -10060190.36], [5038996.16, 5043062.79])" --writers.gdal.filename="hag_mean_howard_co.tif"
> pdal pipeline pipe.json --readers.ept.filename="ept://http://path/to/location" --readers.ept.bounds="([-10063436.56, -10060190.36], [5038996.16, 5043062.79])" --writers.gdal.filename="hag_mean_james_co.tif"
> pdal pipeline pipe.json --readers.ept.filename="ept://http://path/to/location" --readers.ept.bounds="([-10063436.56, -10060190.36], [5038996.16, 5043062.79])" --writers.gdal.filename="hag_mean_mike_co.tif"


Then run that script:

> parallel -j 16 < jobs.txt

Filtering EPT resources with boundaries is a common desire. I recently added a pull request to master (not yet released) that allows you to specify filtering (for faster query) and cropping (eliminating an extra stage specification) for EPT resources. See https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/2771#issue-323371431 <https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/2771#issue-323371431> The goal with the approach in the pull request is to not have to change format of the bounding geometries to text simply to feed them into a pipeline. We may add similar capability to other drivers if it is indeed useful in other contexts. 

With the PR, you could express your query boundaries as an OGR query and then iterate through your EPT resources. The current PR implementation doesn't "split" by the polygons, however. We might need to add the same capability to filters.crop to achieve that. Feedback is appreciated so we can learn how people wish to use this.

I'll just note that the ferry filter in your pipeline does nothing since
you explicitly write the HeightAboveGround dimension in your raster.

I think the answer to this is simply to write a script -- bash or something
similar should work fine.

Thanks Howard! I think this is the way to go. I would be interested in
exploring the pull request version as well, but I may have to wait until
after the holiday break to get to that.

Hi Jason

Weighing in late here, it’s possible to cobble together fiona/shapely/pdal
to loop through a bunch of polygons (or process them in parallel) and do
what you need. It’s a task that’s on my list of things to do when I get
time :)

That way you can assemble a processing pipeline which goes straight from
some geometries to data, without waiting for the new PR..

Cheers,

Adam

Hi,
I will send him a similar python loop tomorrow for inspiration.  Did not have time to look at this today.

Hi Adam, and Nicolas,

I think I understand conceptually how using shapely/geopandas to loop in
coordinates to a pdal pipeline should work. But if you can pass along an
example that would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks again,

Hi,

I am sending this small script as an inspiration.  This is a 
single-threaded the python program that

 1. Scans a directory for a list of .tif file and makes a list of those
    tif files.
 2. Creates an output directory
 3. Build a gdal command line (export the tif to a xyz file) inside the
    function called "gdal_translate2XYZ".
     1. shell = subprocess.Popen(r'c:\OSGeo4W64\OSGeo4W.bat',
        stdin=subprocess.PIPE)
     2. shell.communicate(gdal_translateCmd)
     3. These two above line basically send the command to the OSGeo4W
        shell. (Install Qgis if you don't have it).
 4. Runs this command in a loop (the loop is created by using "map" or
    "p.map" function that operates on the list of tif files)
 5. If you comment out the (if __name__ == '__main__': ) section, the
    commands will run in parallel depending on the size of the pool
    variable.  pool = 6 = 6 parallel commands.  It is easier to debug if
    you  develop in single thread.

The idea is to build your script using python and to run it calling PDAL 
from python.  The Fiona python library with the Shapely library or the 
more complete geopandas library can help manipulate the shapefile.

Hope this helps!

Nicolas

Hi,

This will print the bounds for each object in a shapefile.

To easily make this multithreaded you can use the multiprocessing
library. I've got a ton of code running similar types of command line
tasks in parallel that all boil down to something like the following.
In production, I tend to also keep a single threaded code path that
will run the function in a loop for debugging purposes.

from multiprocessing import Pool

def do_task():
    """Perform what ever standalone task you want to do here."""
    pass

pool = Pool()
results = pool.apply_async(do_task)
pool.close()
pool.join()

Yes very easy,

That section is commented out for now in the script. By removing the #, 
you will be able to multi-thread.

Subject: [pdal] Pdal writers.ept_addon question
Message-ID: <CAJgzRTYHdPDwY378jDazjKyF2BAzw9b6RA_rqEpuK3LEVuzDfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I can’t seem to get pdal’s writers.ept_addon to add the Classification
dimension to my existing ept data set.

Let me explain my current workflow (I know it is not optimal, but we are
working on it). 1) First a field team gathers Lidar data; then does a first
pass to convert the Raw to las data. 2) Then the data is added to an ept
structure. 3) Eventually (weeks or months after) another team will extract
part of the data and do a manual classification. 4) Now I would like to add
the classification information to the existing ept structure.

I have looked at the examples online (pdal.writers.ept_addon and FOSS4G
2019 Bucharest slides) and still can’t seem to make it work.

My pipeline is this as follows

[{             “type”:”readers.ept”,

                “filename”:”~/entwine/existing_data/ept.json”

},

{              “type”:”writers.ept_addon”,

                “addons”:{“~/entwine/Classified_data”: “Classification”}

]

The process takes a little time and I get no error messages. But when I
extract the dataset to laz, there is no classification information.

Something of note, in the entwine ept-data of the Classified_data, for each
x-x-x-x.laz file, there is a x-x-x-x.bin that was created. Is this normal,
what is in the bin?

Another bit of information, I have previously sorted (using GPStime) the
data to ensure that the octrees contain the same points in the
existing_data and Classified_data.

Thanks for any help. I am really stumped on this one.

I'd have to see your reader pipeline to make sure, but make sure that after
you've created the addon with the EPT-addon-writer, that you use the
"addons" option of the EPT *reader* during subsequent reads to dynamically
map these addons into the dataset.

See the "addons" option of the EPT reader here:
https://pdal.io/stages/readers.ept.html
And also see the last example pipeline from the EPT addon writer here which
shows the usage of an addon:
https://pdal.io/stages/writers.ept_addon.html#writers-ept-addon

Note that when *reading* the addons with the EPT reader, the "addons"
option is reversed from the addon-writer option to map the existing addon
directory path into a dimension.

Subject: [pdal] Fixing the topology of the hexagon coverage from density

Hi,

I noticed that the vertices of the hexagon cells that "pdal density" 
writes out do not match exactly. It means that it is not easy to union 
the output into one polygon with GIS tools. The issue can be fixed by 
reducing the precision of coordinates with the PostGIS ST_Snap or 
similar tool. With a projected CRS it was enough to round the 
coordinates into 5 decimal places. It might be good to have a coordinate 
rounding option directly in the density tool.

You should be able to do this by passing the precision argument to the
hexbin filter.  For example: `--filters.hexbin.density=5`.

If this doesn't work, please let me know.

Hi,

I did a test with command

pdal density --driver readers.text  --readers.text.header="x y z" 
--filters.hexbin.precision=4 test.csv 4prec.shp

Precision option is documented to set the minimum precision and so it 
seems to be. Here are three adjacent polygons as an example.

POLYGON ((590196.8408004533 6855474.9200985655, 590181.6192204552 
6855501.2846485, 590196.8408004533 6855527.649198435, 590227.2839604495 
6855527.649198435, 590242.5055404477 6855501.2846485, 590227.2839604495 
6855474.9200985655, 590196.8408004533 6855474.9200985655))

POLYGON ((590196.8408004533 6855527.649198434, 590181.6192204552 
6855554.013748369, 590196.8408004533 6855580.378298304, 
590227.2839604495 6855580.378298304, 590242.5055404477 
6855554.013748369, 590227.2839604495 6855527.649198434, 
590196.8408004533 6855527.649198434))

POLYGON ((590151.1760604589 6855501.2846485, 590135.9544804607 
6855527.649198435, 590151.1760604589 6855554.01374837, 590181.6192204551 
6855554.01374837, 590196.8408004532 6855527.649198435, 590181.6192204551 
6855501.2846485, 590151.1760604589 6855501.2846485))

Polygons have one small gap and two overlaps around here because of 
non-snapped vertices:


Kohteen ID: 187271
[       0:2] POINT (590196.8408004533 6855527.649198435)
Kohteen ID: 187272
[       0:0] POINT (590196.8408004533 6855527.649198434)
Kohteen ID: 187273
[       0:4] POINT (590196.8408004532 6855527.649198435)
