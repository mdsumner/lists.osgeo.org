Subject: [pdal] import pdal: proj_create: Error -5 (unknown projection id)

Hi pdal users.

I recently built a singularity file (i.e. container using CI/CD in gitlab) using a definition file (def file) that install all dependencies for my project.   I clone the PDAL repository and build it from source using cmake and installed the Python binding for PDAL. The container finished building but when I import pdal within the container I get:

>>> import pdal
proj_create: Error -5 (unknown projection id)

I am assuming the error related to PROJ, and when PDAL creating a projection, but it can't recognize the specified projection ID.

I can provide the def file to show how I installed pdal if that helps? I have tried many things and help to solve would be appreciated?

Dom

Presumably whatever made your container didn't keep the PROJ_DATA environment variable linkages. Set PROJ_DEBUG=ON in your environment and maybe it will complain with some clues.

This is not a PDAL problem.

Subject: [pdal] Migration to pdal.org
Message-ID: <39962C3D-672D-45AD-A7A3-829E49966412@hobu.co>

All,

With the recent turmoil about the future of .io domains, which subsequently settled down for now, Hobu investigated and acquired the pdal.org domain, which hadn't previously been for sale when PDAL was founded. It is now a simple redirect to pdal.io, but over the next month or so, we will undertake a migration to pdal.org as the canonical domain for PDAL. Afterward, the .io domain will continue to permanently redirect to .org, but public URLs will slowly start migrating over to .org as we update them.

As with any migrations, there may be a few hiccups.

Howard
